The\ncountry is remembering every personality, including the revered Bapu, who\nmade freedom a mass movement, Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, who\nsacrificed everything for the freedom, or great revolutionaries like Bhagat\nSingh, Chandrasekhar Azad, Bismil and Ashfaqulla Khan; Rani of Jhansi\nLakshmibai, Queen Chennamma of Kittur or Rani Gaidinliu or the valour of\nMatanginiHazra in Assam; the country's first Prime Minister Pandit Nehru ji,\nSardar Vallabhbhai Patel, who integrated the country into a united nation,\nand Baba Saheb Ambedkar, who determined and paved the way for the\nfuture direction of India. The country is indebted to all these great\npersonalities.\n\nIndia is a land endowed with gems. I salute countless people from every\ncorner of India whose names don’t even figure in history, but who have built\nthis nation and have also taken it forward in every period.\n\nIndia has fought for the motherland, culture and freedom for centuries. This\ncountry never gave up the pain of slavery and the longing for freedom for\ncenturies. In the midst of victories and defeats, the aspiration of freedom\nengraved in the mind was never diminished. Today is the time to bow down\nto the leaders of all these struggles, the warriors of centuries of struggle\nand they also deserve our reverence.\n\nOur doctors, nurses, paramedical staff, sanitation staff, scientists engaged\nin developing vaccines, millions of countrymen engaged with the spirit of\nservice during this Corona global pandemic also deserve praise from all of\nus.\nToday there are floods in some areas of the country, landslides have also\noccurred. Some sad news also keeps coming. The hardships of the people\nhave increased in many areas. At such a time, both the Central and State\nGovernments are with them in complete readiness. Today, the young\nathletes and our players who have brought laurels to India are also present\nin this event.\n\nSome are present and sitting here. Today, I appeal to all the countrymen,\nthose who are present here and all those who are present in this ceremony\nfrom every corner of India, that in the honour of our players, for a few\nmoments let's salute them with resounding clapping applause and show\nrespect for their huge accomplishments.\n\nLet us show our respect to the sports of India, youth of India and honour\nthe young Indians who bring laurels to the nation. Crores of countrymen are\nshowing respect to the youth of India, especially the athletes who brought\nhonour to India with a thunderous applause. I can be proud that they have\nnot only won our hearts today, but also inspired the youth of India and\nfuture generations with their huge achievements.\n\nMy dear countrymen,\n\nWhile we celebrate our freedom today, we cannot forget the pain of\npartition that still pierces through the heart of all Indians. This has been one\nof the biggest tragedies of the last century. After attaining freedom, these\npeople were forgotten too soon. Just yesterday India has taken an\nemotional decision in their memory. We will henceforth commemorate\nAugust 14 as “Partition Horrors Remembrance Day” in the memory of all\nthe victims of partition. Those who were subjected to inhuman\ncircumstances, suffered torturous treatment, they could not even receive a\ndignified cremation. They must all remain alive and never get erased from\nour memories. The decision of celebrating “Partition Horrors Remembrance\nDay” on the 75th Independence Day is a befitting tribute from every Indian\nto them.\nMy dear countrymen,\n\nFor the country moving on the path of progress and humanity in the entire\nworld, the Corona period came as a major challenge. Indians fought this\nfight with great grit and patience. We had many challenges. Countrymen\nperformed extraordinarily in every field. It is due to the power of our\nentrepreneurs and scientists that the country is not dependent on anyone\nor any country for vaccines. Imagine for a ment, if we did not have the\nvaccine. How long did it take to get polio vaccine?\n\nIt was extremely difficult to get vaccines during such a major crisis, with\npandemic plaguing the entire world. India might or might not have received\nit and even if it had received the vaccine there was no certainty of getting\nthat in time. But today we can proudly say that the world's largest\nvaccination programme is being run in our country. More than 54 crore\npeople have received the vaccine dose. Online systems like Cowin and\ndigital certificates are attracting the world today. The way India has kept the\nstoves burning in the poor households by providing free food grains to 80\ncrore countrymen continuously for months during the pandemic is not only\nastonishing to the world but also a matter of discussion. It is true that fewer\npeople have been infected in India as compared to other countries; it is\nalso true that in comparison to the population of other countries of the\nworld, we managed to save more citizens in India but it is not something to\nbe proud of! We cannot rest on these laurels. To say that there was no\nchallenge, will become a restrictive thought in the path of our own\ndevelopment.\n\nOur systems are insufficient compared to that of the rich countries of the\nworld, we do not have what the rich countries have. Moreover, we also\nhave a greater population compared to the other countries of the world.\nAnd our lifestyle is also different. Despite all our efforts, we could not save\nmany people. So many children have been orphaned. This unbearable pain\nis going to remain forever.\nMy dear countrymen,\n\nThere comes a time in the development journey of every country when the\ncountry redefines itself afresh and pushes forward with new resolutions.\nToday that time has arrived in the development journey of India. We should\nnot limit the occasion of 75 years of Indian independence to just one\nceremony. We must lay the groundwork for new resolutions and move\nforward with new resolutions. Starting from here, the entire journey of the\nnext 25 years, when we celebrate the centenary of Indian independence,\nmarks the Amrit period of creation of a new India. The fulfillment of our\nresolutions in this Amrit period will take us to the hundredth anniversary of\nIndian independence with pride.\n\nThe goal of 'Amrit Kaal' is to ascend to new heights of prosperity for India\nand the citizens of India. The goal of 'Amrit Kaal' is to create an India where\nthe level of facilities is not dividing the village and the city. The goal of\n'Amrit Kaal' is to build an India where the government does not interfere\nunnecessarily in the lives of citizens. The goal of 'Amrit Kaal' is to build an\nIndia where there is world’s every modern infrastructure.\n\nWe should not be lesser than anyone. This is the resolve of the crores of\ncountrymen. But the resolve remains incomplete until it is not accompanied\nby the extreme hard work and courage. Therefore, we have to realize all\nour resolutions with hard work and courage, and these dreams and\nresolutions are also for effective contribution to a safe and prosperous\nworld beyond our borders.\n\nAmrit Kaal is of 25 years. But we don't have to wait for long to achieve our\ngoals. We have to start now. We don't have a moment to lose. This is the\nright time. Our country also has to change and we as citizens have to\nchange ourselves too. We also have to adapt ourselves to the changing\nera. We have started with the spirit of ‘SabkaSaath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka\nVishwas’. Today I am requesting from the ramparts of the Red Fort that\n‘SabkaSaath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas’ and now ‘SabkaPrayas’ are\nvery important for the achievement of our goals. Crores of people are\ngetting the benefits of many schemes started in the last seven years. Every\npoor of the country knows the importance of Ujjwala to Ayushman Bharat.\nToday the speed of government schemes has increased and they are\nachieving the desired goals. We have progressed much faster than before.\nBut it does not end here. We have to achieve saturation. All the villages\nshould have roads, all the households should have bank accounts, all the\nbeneficiaries should have Ayushman Bharat cards and all the eligible\npersons should get the benefit of Ujjwala Yojana and should have gas\nconnections. We have to connect every entitled person with the\ngovernment’s insurance, pension and housing schemes. We have to move\nahead with a mindset of cent percent achievement. Till now, no thought\nwas given for our street vendors, who sell their goods on tracks, footpaths\nand carts. All these colleagues are now being linked to the banking system\nthrough the SVANidhi scheme.\n\nJust as we have made electricity accessible to 100% households, and have\nmade authentic efforts to construct toilets in 100% households, similarly, we\nnow have to move ahead with the goal of achieving saturation of schemes,\nand, for this, we do not have to keep a distant deadline. We have to make\nour resolutions come true within a few years.\n\nToday, our country is working with speed on the Har Ghar Jal Mission. I am\nhappy that in just two years of the Jal Jeevan Mission, more than four and\na half crore families have started getting water from taps. They have\nstarted getting water from pipes. Receiving the blessings from crores of\nmothers and sisters, is our true capital. The biggest advantage of this 100\npercent accomplishment rate is that no one remains deprived of the\nbenefits of the government scheme. When the government operates with a\ntarget to reach the person in the last line, only then there is no\ndiscrimination and there is no scope for corruption.\n\nMy dear countrymen,\n\nProviding nutrition to every poor person of the country is also a priority of\nthis government. Malnutrition and lack of essential nutrients in poor women\nand poor children poses major obstacles in their development. In view of\nthis, it has been decided that the government will fortify the rice given to the\npoor under its various schemes. Will give rice fortified with nutrition to the\npoor. Be it the rice available at the ration shop, the rice provided to the\nchildren in the mid-day meal, or the rice available through every scheme, it\nshall be fortified by the year 2024.\n\nMy dear countrymen,\n\nToday, the campaign to provide better health facilities to every poor in the\ncountry is also going on at a fast pace. For this, important reforms have\nalso been made in medical education. Equal attention has been paid to\npreventive healthcare. Simultaneously, there has been a substantial\nincrease in the number of medical seats in the country. Under the\nAyushman Bharat scheme, quality health services are being provided to\nevery village in the country. Affordable medicines are being made available\nto the poor and middle class through Jan Aushadhi Yojana. So far, more\nthan 75 thousand Health and Wellness centers have been set up. At the\nblock level too, modern health infrastructure is being exclusively set up on\na network of good hospitals and modern labs. Very soon thousands of\nhospitals in the country will also have their own oxygen plants.\n\nMy dear countrymen,\n\nTo take India to new heights in the 21st century, the optimal utilisation of\nIndia's potential is the need of the hour.\n\nThis is extremely important. For this, we need to provide hand holding to\nthe backward categories and sectors. Alongwith the concern of fulfilling the\nbasic needs, reservation is being ensured for the Dalits, Backward classes,\nAdivasis and the poor people from general category. More recently, in the\nfield of medical education, reservation has also been ensured for the OBC\ncategory in the All India quota. By formulating a law in Parliament, the right\nto make their own list of OBC has been given to the states.\nMy dear countrymen,\n\nJust as we are making sure that no person or no class should be left\nbehind in the development journey of society, similarly no part of the\ncountry, no corner of the country should be left behind. Development\nshould be all-round, development should be all-pervasive, development\nshould be all-inclusive. We are now accelerating the efforts that have been\nmade in the last seven years to bring forward such backward areas of the\ncountry. Be it the eastern India, the North-east, Jammu-Kashmir, Ladakh\nincluding the entire Himalayan region, be it our coastal belt or the tribal\nregion, these regions are going to turn into a major foundation for India's\ndevelopment in future, India's development journey.\n\nToday a new history of connectivity is being written in the North-East. This\nis a connectivity of both the hearts and the infrastructure. Very soon the\nwork of connecting all the state capitals of the North-East with rail service is\ngoing to be completed. Under the Act-East Policy, today North-East,\nBangladesh, Myanmar and South-East Asia are also being connected. Due\nto the efforts made in the past years, now the enthusiasm for the creation of\nShreshtha Bharat and long lasting peace in the North-East has increased\nmanifold.\n\nThere is a huge potential in the fields of tourism, adventure sports, organic\nfarming, herbal medicine, and oil palm in the North East. We have to fully\nharness this potential and make it a part of the development journey of the\ncountry. And we have to complete this work within a few decades of the\n'Amrit kaal'. Giving a fair opportunity to the capabilities of all is the true spirit\nof democracy. Be it Jammu or Kashmir, the balance of development is now\nvisible on the ground.\n\nThe Delimitation Commission has been constituted in Jammu and Kashmir\nand preparations are also going on for the assembly elections. Ladakh has\nalso progressed towards its limitless possibilities of development. On one\nhand Ladakh is witnessing the creation of modern infrastructure, while on\nthe other hand Sindhu Central University is also making Ladakh a center of\nhigher education.\n\nIn this decade of the 21st century, India will further accelerate its efforts\ntowards the Blue Economy. Along with aquaculture, we have to take full\nadvantage of the new possibilities that are emerging in the cultivation of\nseaweed. The Deep Ocean Mission is the result of our ambition to explore\nthe unlimited possibilities of the ocean. The mineral wealth which is hidden\nin the sea, the thermal energy which is in the sea water, can give new\nheights to the development of the country.\n\nWe have also awakened the aspirations of the districts of the country\nbelieved to have been left behind. Priority is being given to schemes\nrelated to education, health, nutrition, roads and employment in more than\n110 aspirational districts in the country. Many of these districts are in our\ntribal areas. We have created a spirit of healthy competition for\ndevelopment among these districts. There is a strong competition going on\nin that direction so that these aspirational districts are at par with other\ndistricts of India.\n\nMy dear countrymen,\n\nCapitalism and socialism are discussed a lot in the world of economics, but\nIndia also emphasizes cooperativism. Cooperativism is also compatible\nwith our traditions and values. Cooperativism, in which the collective power\nof the masses becomes the driving force of the economy, is important for\nthe country's grassroots level economy. Co-operatives are not just a\nsystem with a network of laws and rules, but co-operative is a spirit, culture,\nand a mindset of collective growth. We have taken steps to empower them\nby forming a separate ministry. We have taken this step to empower the\ncooperative sector in the states.\n\nMy dear countrymen,\nWe will have to put all our efforts to build a new economy in the villages in\nthis decade. Today we can see our villages changing rapidly. In the last few\nyears, our government has provided roads and electricity to the villages.\nNow these villages have been strengthened with optical fibernetwork data\nand the Internet. Digital entrepreneurs are emerging in the villages also.\nThe more than eight crore sisters in the villages, who are associated with\nSelf-Help Groups, design top-end products. Now the government will also\nprepare an e-commerce platform for their products so that get a big market\nin our country and abroad. Today, when the country is moving forward with\nthe mantra of Vocal for Local, this digital platform will connect the products\nof women self-help groups with people across the length and breadth of the\ncountry as well as internationally. Their horizon shall thus get enhanced.\n\nDuring Corona, the country has witnessed the power of technology, as well\nas the commitment and capabilities of our scientists. The scientists of our\ncountry are working very diligently and strategically across the expanse of\n​the country. Now the time has come for us to integrate the capabilities of\n scientists and their suggestions in our agriculture sector as well. Now we\n cannot wait any longer. We have to leverage this strength. This will go a\n long way in increasing the production of fruits, vegetables and grains along\n with giving food security to the country. Thus we shall catapult ourselves\n strongly into the world orbit.\n\nAmongst these concerted efforts, we need to take cognizance of a major\nchallenge posed in our agriculture sector. Challenge of shrinking of land of\nvillagers which is due to immense rise in population, and smaller land\nholdings due to the divisions happening in the family. Farming land has\nshrunk alarmingly. More than 80 percent of the farmers of the country are\nthose who have less than two hectares of land. If we see, 80 out of 100\nfarmers have less than two hectares of land i.e. the farmers of our country\nare practically in the small farmer category. Unfortunately, this segment\nremained eliminated from the benefits in our yesteryear’s policies. They did\nnot get their due importance. Now, keeping in mind these small farmers in\nthe country, agricultural reforms are being undertaken, and critical\ndecisions are being taken to benefit them.\nWhether the improvement in the crop insurance scheme or important\ndecision of increasing the MSP by one and a half times; a system to\nprovide loans from banks at cheaper rates through Kisan Credit Card;\ntaking the schemes related to solar power to the farm, formulate a Farmer\nProducer Organization. All these efforts will increase the power of the small\nfarmer. In the coming times, a campaign will also be launched to create a\nwarehouse facility up to the block level.\n\nKeeping in mind the small expenses of every small farmer, PM\nKisanSamman Nidhi Yojana is being run. So far, more than 1.5 lakh crores\nhave been deposited directly into the bank accounts of more than ten crore\nfarmer families. The small farmer is now our resolve and mantra for us. The\nsmall farmer becomes the country's pride.... the small farmer becomes the\nnation's pride. This is our dream. In the coming years, we will have to\nincrease the collective power of the small farmers of the country. New\nfacilities have to be provided.\n\nToday, Kisan Rail is plying on more than 70 rail routes of the country. Kisan\nRail can help small farmers with this modern facility to reach far flung areas\non a low cost of produce and transportation. Several products like\nKamalam, Shahi litchi, BhutJolokiachillis, black rice or turmeric are being\nexported to different countries of the world. Today, the country feels\ndelighted when the aroma of these products produced in the soil of India\nreaches different countries of the world. Today the world is developing a\ntaste for the vegetables and food grains grown in the fields of India.\n\nMy dear countrymen,\n\nSwamitva Yojana is an example of one of the initiatives taken to boost the\ncapabilities of the villages today. We all know what happens to the price of\nland in villages. They do not get any loan from the banks on the basis of\nland, despite being the owners of the land because no work had been done\nin terms of documents of rural land for several years. People do not have\nthis system. The Swamitva scheme attempted to change this situation.\nToday every village, every house, every land is being mapped through\ndrones. The data and property papers of village lands are being uploaded\nonline. With this, not only the disputes related to land in the villages are\nbeing ended, but a system has also been created for the people of the\nvillage to get loans easily from the banks. The lands of village poor should\nbe the foundation for development rather than disputes. And the country is\nmoving in the same direction today.\n\nMy dear countrymen,\n\nWhen Swami Vivekananda used to talk about the future of India, when he\nused to see the magnificence of Mother Bharati in front of his eyes, he\nused to say – Try to look into the past as far as possible. Drink the water of\nthe ever new spring flowing back there, and after that, look ahead. Go\nahead and make India brighter, greater & better than ever. In this 75th year\nof independence, it is our duty to move forward believing in the immense\npotential of the country. We have to work together for new generation\ninfrastructure; we have to work together for world class manufacturing; we\nhave to work together for cutting edge innovations; we have to work\ntogether for new age technology.\n\nMy dear countrymen,\n\nThe foundation of progress in the modern world lies on modern\ninfrastructure. It also fulfills the needs and aspirations of the middle class.\nWeak infrastructure derails the pace of development and the urban middle\nclass also suffers.\n\nWe have to work together for next generation infrastructure, for world class\nmanufacturing, for cutting edge innovation and for New Age technology.\n\nMy dear countrymen,\n\nRealizing this need, the country has demonstrated extraordinary speed and\nscale in every field from the seas, land to the skies. Rapid progress is\nunderway whether it is development of new waterways or connecting new\nplaces with seaplanes. Indian Railways is also rapidly adapting to its\nmodern avatar. The country has resolved to celebrate the Amrit Mahotsav\nof independence. You would know that we have decided to celebrate this\nAmrit Mahotsav of independence for 75 weeks. It started from 12th March\nand will continue till 15th August, 2023. We have to move forward with new\nenthusiasm and, therefore, the country has made a very important\ndecision.\n\nDuring these 75 weeks of the Amrit Mahotsav of Independence, 75 Vande\nBharat trains will connect every corner of the country. The pace at which\nnew airports are being built in the country and the UDAN scheme\nconnecting remote areas is unprecedented. We can see how better air\nconnectivity gives new flights to people's dreams.\n\nMy dear countrymen,\n\nAlong with modern infrastructure, there is a great need for adopting a\nholistic and integrated approach in infrastructure construction. In the near\nfuture, we are going to launch the National Master Plan of Prime Minister\n‘Gati Shakti’ which will be a huge scheme and fulfill the dreams of crores of\ncountrymen. This scheme of more than 100 lakh crores rupees will result in\nnew employment opportunities for lakhs of youth.\n\nGati Shakti will be a National Infrastructure Master Plan for our country\nwhich will lay the foundation of holistic Infrastructure and will lead to an\nintegrated and holistic pathway to our economy. Right now, there is no\ncoordination between our means of transport. Gati Shakti will break the\nsilos, and will remove all these obstacles. This will reduce the travel time\nfor the common man and the productivity of our industry will also increase.\nGati Shakti will also go a long way in making our local manufacturers\nglobally competitive and this will also develop new possibilities for the\ncreation of future economic zones. In this decade, the power of speed will\nform the basis of India's transformation.\nMy dear countrymen,\n\nIndia will have to increase both its manufacturing and exports while moving\nahead on the path of development.\n\nMy dear countrymen,\n\nTreading ahead on the path of development, India will have to augment\nboth its manufacturing and exports. You have witnessed, just a few days\nago, India launched its first indigenous Aircraft Carrier INS Vikrant for trial\nin the sea. Today India is making its own indigenous fighter aircraft, its own\nsubmarine. Gaganyaan is also slated to hoist India's flag in space. This\nitself is evidential of our immense capabilities in indigenous manufacturing.\n\nThe country has also announced Production Linked Incentive to\nconsolidate our Make in India campaign in the wake of the new economic\nconditions that have emerged due to Corona. The electronic manufacturing\nsector stands as an example of the change that is enforced through this\nscheme. Seven years ago we used to import mobile phones worth about\neight billion dollars. However, now the import has reduced considerably,\nand today we are also exporting mobile phones worth three billion dollars.\n\nToday, when our manufacturing sector is gaining momentum, our focus\nshould be that whatever we make in India should be of highest quality\nstandards so that we sustain in the global competition. Rather, if possible\nwe should aim at going a step ahead and take proactive steps to prepare\nourselves for the global market. We have to target that. I want to say\nemphatically to all the manufacturers of the country, that you should never\nforget that the product you sell overseas is not just a product made by your\ncompany, it is the identity of our nation, India's prestige and the faith of all\nthe citizens of our country.\n\nMy dear countrymen\nThat is why I tell all our manufacturers that each of your products is a brand\nambassador of India. When someone will buy and use your product, the\ncustomer should say with pride- now “This is Made in India”. That's the\nmindset we need. You all should now aspire to win over the global market.\nThe government is fully with you in realising this dream.\n\nMy dear countrymen,\n\nToday, several new start-ups are being formed in different sectors of the\ncountry and even in smaller tier 2, tier 3 cities of the country. They also\nhave a big role to play in getting entry of their Indian products into the\ninter-state market.The government stands with all its might, with these\nstart-ups. Whether it is giving them financial help, cash discounts, rules\nsimplification for them, the government is fully with them. We have seen\nthat thousands of new start-ups have emerged in this difficult period of\nCorona. They are moving forward with great success. Yesteryear’s\nstart-ups are becoming today's unicorns. Their market value is reaching\nthousands of crores of rupees.\n\nThese are new types of wealth creators in our country today. They are\nstanding on their feet with the power of their unique ideas, moving ahead\nand walking with the dream of conquering the world. They are new kinds of\nwealth creators. They are moving by the force of their unique ideas and a\ndream to win over the world. In this decade, we need to relentlessly work\ntowards making India's Startups and the Startup Ecosystem the best in the\nwhole world.\n\nMy countrymen,\n\nPolitical will is needed to bring about major changes and reforms. Today\nthe world is witnessing that there is no dearth of political will in India. Good\nand smart governance is required to implement the reforms. Today the\nworld is also a witness to how India is writing a new chapter of governance\nhere. In this decade of 'Amrit Kaal', we will give priority to Next Generation\nreforms... We will ensure that all the facilities like service delivery should\nreach citizens up to the last mile; it should reach the last person\nseamlessly, without hesitation or any kind of difficulty. For the overall\ndevelopment of the country, unnecessary interference by the government\nand the government processes in the lives of the people has to be ended.\n\nEarlier, the government itself was on the driving seat. This might have been\nthe demand of that time. But now the time has changed. In the last seven\nyears, efforts have also intensified in the country to liberate the people of\nthe country from the web of unnecessary laws and procedures. Till now\nhundreds of old laws of the country have been abolished. Even during this\nperiod of Corona pandemic, the government has abolished more than\n15,000 compliances. Now you see, you might have experienced a lot of\nhassles and paperwork for a small government work. That has been the\nsituation so far. We have ended 15,000 compliances.\n\nJust imagine.....I want to give you an example. A law has been in place in\nIndia for over 200 years, 200 years i.e. even before 1857. As per this law,\nthe citizens of the country did not have the right to create maps. Now\nimagine, it was in place since 1857. If you want to create a map, then seek\npermission from the government, if you want to print the map in a book,\nthen seek permission from the government; there is a provision for arrest if\nthe map is lost. Nowadays every phone has a Map app. Satellites have so\nmuch power! Then how will we take the country forward with a burden of\nsuch laws? It is very important to get rid of this burden of compliances. We\nhave abolished several regulations in various sectors like mapping, space,\ninformation technology and BPO.\n\nMy dear countrymen,\n\nFreedom from the clutches of unnecessary laws is very important for both\nEase of Living as well as Ease of Doing Business. Our country's industries\nand businesses are experiencing this change today.\n\nToday dozens of labor laws have been subsumed into just 4 codes. Tax\nrelated arrangements have also been made easy and become faceless\nnow. We will have to work together so that such reforms are not limited to\nthe government only, but percolate down to gram panchayats, municipal\ncorporations and municipalities. I am calling upon, making an earnest\nappeal to all the central and state departments to launch a campaign to\nreview the existing rules and procedures. We have to get rid of every rule,\nevery process which has become a hindrance and a burden for the people\nof the country. I know what has accumulated in 70-75 years will not go\naway in a day or in a year. But if we start working with a purpose, we will\ndefinitely be able to do this.\n\nMy dear countrymen,\n\nKeeping this in mind, the government has also started Mission Karmayogi\nand Capacity Building Commission to increase people-centric approach in\nbureaucracy and improve their efficiency.\n\nMy dear countrymen,\n\nOur education, education system, education tradition has a great role in\npreparing the youth, who are possessed with skill and ability, and who have\nthe spirit to do something for the country. Today the country also has a new\nNational Education Policy to meet the needs of the 21st century. Now our\nchildren will neither stop due to lack of skills nor will they be bound by\nlanguage barriers. Unfortunately, there is a massive divide in our country\nregarding language. We have tied a huge talent of the country to the cage\nof language. One can find promising people in their mother tongue. If\npeople from the vernacular medium come forward, their self-confidence will\ngrow. Justice will be done to the potential of the poor children when they\nwill become professionals by studying in their mother tongue.\n\nI believe that language is the instrument of the fight against poverty in the\nnew National Education Policy. This new National Education Policy is also\ngoing to be a great tool to fight against poverty in a way. The basis of\nwinning the war against poverty is also the education, prestige and\nimportance of the vernacular language. The country has seen this in the\nplayground... and we are experiencing that language has not become a\nbarrier and as a result we have seen that the youth are playing and\nblossoming. Now the same thing will happen in other fields of life as well.\n\nAnother special feature of the new National Education Policy is that sports\nhas been made a part of mainstream education instead of extra-curricular.\nSports is also one of the most effective means of pursuing life. It is very\nimportant to have sports in life for perfection in life. There was a time when\nsports was not considered mainstream. Parents also considered indulging\nin sports as wastage of life. Now, there is a new awareness about fitness\nand sports. We have seen and felt this in the olympics. This change is a big\nturning point for us. That is why, we need to speed up and expand the\ncampaign that is going on in the country for infusing talent, technology and\nprofessionalism in sports.\n\nIt is a matter of pride for the country that our daughters are performing in an\nunprecedented manner in the fields of education, sports, Boards results or\nolympics. Today daughters are raring to occupy their place. We have to\nensure that women have equal partnership in every career and workspace.\nWe have to ensure that they feel safe from roads to the workplace and\neverywhere. There should be a feeling of respect for them and in this, the\ngovernment, administration, police and justice system will have to perform\ntheir duty cent percent. We have to make this resolution , the resolution of\nthe 75 years of Independence.\n\nToday I am sharing good news with the countrymen. I used to get lakhs of\nmessages from our daughters that they want to study in the Sainik Schools.\nThe Doors of the schools should be opened for them. We did a pilot project\nin the Sainik School of Mizoram two-two and half years ago by giving\nadmission to our daughters. Now the Government has decided that all the\nSainik Schools will be open for the girls. Daughter too will study in all the\nSainik Schools of the Country.\n\nEnvironmental security is getting the same importance in the world as\nnational security.Today India is a vibrant voice of environmental security,\nwhether it is biodiversity or land neutrality, climate change or waste\nrecycling, organic farming or biogas, energy conservation or clean energy\ntransition. India’s efforts in environment are giving results today. Increase in\nforest cover, number of national parks, increase in number of tigers and\nAsiatic lions are a matter of happiness for the countrymen.\n\nAmong all these successes one truth needs to be understood. India is not\nyet energy independent. India today spends more than 12 lakh crore\nrupees annually for importing energy. For India's progress and to build a\nself-reliant India, India's energy independence is the need of the hour!\nTherefore today, India has to make a resolution to make India energy\nindependent before the completion of 100 years of independence and our\nroadmap is very clear for the same. It should be a gas based economy.\nThere should be a network of CNG & PNG across the country. There\nshould be a target of 20 percent ethanol blending. India is moving ahead\nwith a set goal. India has also made a move towards Electric Mobility and\nthe work on 100% electrification of Railways is also progressing at a fast\npace. Indian Railways has set a target of becoming Net Zero Carbon\nEmitter by 2030. Besides these efforts, the country is also emphasizing on\nMission Circular Economy. Our Vehicle Scrap Policy is a great example of\nthe same. Today, India is the only country in the group of G-20 countries,\nwhich is moving fast towards achieving its climate goals.\n\n India has set a target of 450 GW of renewable energy by the end of this\ndecade - 450 GW by 2030. Of this, the target of 100 GW has been\nachieved by India ahead of schedule. These efforts are also instilling\nconfidence in the world. The formation of the International Solar Alliance\non the Global State is a great example of the same.\n\nOf every effort being made by India today, the thing that is going to help\nIndia with a quantum leap in terms of climate is the field of ​Green\nHydrogen. To achieve the goal of Green Hydrogen, I am announcing the\nNational Hydrogen Mission today with this tricolour as a witness. We have\nto make India a Global Hub for Green Hydrogen Production and Export in\nthe 'Amrit Kaal'. This will not only help India to make a new progress in the\nfield of energy self-reliance but will also become a new inspiration for Clean\nEnergy Transition all over the world. New opportunities from Green Growth\nto Green Job are opening up today for our start-ups & youth.\n\nMy dear countrymen,\n\nToday, the 21st century India has the ability to create and achieve big goals\nas well. Today India is also solving those subject areas, which were\nhanging fires for decades and centuries. Be it a historic decision to\nabrogate Article 370, introduction of GST, a system that frees the country\nfrom the web of taxes, a decision regarding 'One Rank-One Pension' for\nour military friends, a peaceful solution to the Ram Janmabhoomi issue, we\nhave seen it come true in a few years\n\nIndia’s willpower is realizing all the resolutions whether it is the Bru-Reang\nagreement in Tripura after decades, constitutional status to the OBC\ncommission or the BDC and DDC elections in Jammu and Kashmir for the\nfirst time since independence.\n\nEven in this period of Corona, record foreign investment is coming to India.\nIndia's foreign exchange reserves are also at an all-time high. India has\nalso given the message of the might of New India to the enemies of the\ncountry by carrying out surgical and air strikes. It shows that India is\nchanging. India can change. India can take the toughest decisions and it\ndoes not hesitate and stop in taking even the toughest decisions.\n\nMy dear countrymen,\n\nThe nature of global relations has changed after the Second World War.\nThere is a possibility of a new world order post Corona. The world has seen\nand appreciated India's efforts during Corona. Today the world is looking at\nIndia from a new perspective. There are two important aspects of this\nperception -- one is terrorism and the other is expansionism. India is\nfighting both these challenges and is also responding strongly in a\nrestrained manner. Our defense preparedness has to be equally strong if\nIndia has to fulfil its obligations properly.\n\nWe are making constant efforts to provide new opportunities to our\nhardworking entrepreneurs and to encourage Indian companies to make\nthe country self-reliant in the field of defence. I assure the country that we\nwill leave no stone unturned to strengthen the hands of our forces engaged\nin the defense of the country.\n\nMy dear countrymen,\n\nToday is also the birth anniversary of the great thinker of the country, Sri\nAurobindo. His 150th birth anniversary will be celebrated in 2022. Sri\nAurobindo was a visionary of India's bright future. He used to say that we\nhave to be as powerful as we were never before. We have to change our\nhabits. We have to re-awaken ourselves. These words of Sri Aurobindo\nremind us of our duties. We also have to think about what we are giving to\nthe country as a citizen and as a society. We have always given importance\nto rights. They were needed during that period, but now we have to make\nduties paramount. Everybody will have to contribute in fulfilling the\nresolutions of the country. Every citizen will have to own this up.\n\nOur country has initiated a campaign of water conservation, so it is our duty\nto include saving water in our habits. If the country is emphasizing on digital\ntransactions, then it is also our duty to do minimum cash transactions. The\ncountry has started the campaign of Local for Vocal, so it is our duty to buy\nas many local products as possible. To strengthen our vision of a\nplastic-free India of the country, it is our duty to completely stop the use of\nsingle use plastic. It is our duty not to throw dirt in our rivers, keep our sea\nshores clean. We also have to take the Swachh Bharat Mission to another\nnew level.\n\nToday, when the country is celebrating the Amrit Mahotsav on the occasion\nof 75 years of independence, it is the duty of all of us to join this event,\nparticipate in it enthusiastically, and keep kindling our resolutions again and\nagain. Keeping freedom struggle in mind, whatever little you do…\nwhatever… will be pure like a drop of nectar, and this Amrit Kumbh made\nby the pure efforts of many Indians will inspire the entire nation for years to\ncome.\n\nMy dear countrymen,\n\nI am not a fortune teller, I believe in action. I have faith in the youth of my\ncountry, I trust the sisters of the country, the daughters of the country, the\nfarmers of the country, and the professionals of the country. This ‘CAN DO’\ngeneration can achieve every goal imaginable.\n\nI believe that in 2047, on the occasion of celebrating 100 years of\nindependence… whoever will be the Prime Minister… whoever will be the\nPrime Minister after 25 years from today, when he will be unfurling the\nflag… I say this with confidence today that he or she shall be chronicling\nthose accomplishments in his speech about which the country has taken a\nvow today... This is my firm belief of victory.\n\nToday whatever I am speaking of in the form of a resolution, whoever hoists\nthe flag after 25 years, shall be speaking of the same in the form of\naccomplishments. The country would be singing its glory in the form of\nthese accomplishments. Youth of the country of today, shall also see at that\ntime how the country has achieved this glory.\n\nIn the 21st century, no obstacle can stop us from fulfilling the dreams and\naspirations of India. Our strength is our vitality, our strength is our solidarity,\nour vitality is the spirit of nation first - always first. This is the time for\nshared dreams, this is the time for shared resolve, this is the time for\nshared efforts... and this is the time to move towards victory.\n\nAnd so I say once again-\n\nThis is the time,\nThis is the time.. the right time!\n\nIndia's precious time!\n\nThis is the time, the right time! India's precious time!\n\nThe power of countless arms,\n\nThe power of countless arms,\n\nThere is patriotism everywhere!\n\nThere is the power of innumerable arms, there is patriotism everywhere…\n\nCome, rise and unfurl the Tricolour!\n\nCome, rise and unfurl the Tricolour!\n\nTurn the fate of India,\n\nTurn the fate of India,\n\nThis is the time, the right time! India's precious time!\n\nThere is nothing..\n\nThere is nothing you cannot do,\n\nThere is nothing you cannot achieve,\n\nYou Rise...\n\nYou Rise and Begin,\n\nRecognize your abilities,\nRecognize your abilities,\n\nUnderstand all your duties,\n\nUnderstand all your duties!\n\nThis is the time, the right time! India's precious time!\n\nWhen the country completes 100 years of independence, the goals of the\ncountrymen must be turned into reality; that is my desire. With my best\nwishes, I once again congratulate all the countrymen on the 75th\nIndependence Day! Say aloud with your fists up -\n\nJai Hind,\n\nJai Hind,\n\nJai Hind!\n\nVande Matram,\n\nVande Matram,\n\nVande Matram!\n\nLong live Mother India,\n\nLong live Mother India,\n\nLong live Mother India!\n\nThanks a lot!"},{"year":2020,"pm":"Narendra Modi","party":"BJP","footnote":"English rendering of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s address to the Nation from the ramparts of the Red Fort on the 74th Independence Day- August 15, 2020","source":"Press Information Bureau","url":"https://pib.gov.in/","text":"My dear countrymen,\n\nCongratulations and many best wishes to all the countrymen on this\nauspicious occasion of independence.\n\nToday, we are able to live in an independent India because of the sacrifices\nof millions of sons and daughters of Mother India. This is an occasion to\npay tribute to the freedom fighters, martyrs and brave souls and their spirit\nand dedication to free Mother India.\n\nThe valiant soldiers of our armed forces, our paramilitary forces, our police\npersonnel and our security forces- everyone is engaged in protecting\nMother India. They are engaged in safeguarding the common man. Today\nis the day to remember their sacrifices and penance sincerely and\nwholeheartedly.\n\nThere is another name: Aurobindo Ghose. Today is the birth anniversary of\nAurobindo Ghose, who tread the path from being a revolutionary to\nspirituality. Let us seek his blessings so that we can fulfil his as well as our\nvision.\n\nWe are passing through an extraordinary situation. Today, children- the\nbright future of India- are not in front of me. Why? It is because Corona has\nstopped everyone. In this period of corona, I salute millions of corona\nwarriors- doctors, nurses, sanitation workers, ambulance drivers and so\non-who all should I count.\n\nI salute all the corona warriors, who for a long time have adhered to the\nmantra of ‘सेवा परमो धर्म’ i.e. service is the best religion and have served the\nchildren of Mother India with complete dedication.\n\nIn the period of corona, many of our brothers and sisters have been\naffected by this pandemic; many families have been affected; many have\nalso lost their lives. I express my condolences to all such families, and I\nbelieve the indomitable will power and determination of 130 crore\ncountrymen will make us win over Corona and we shall definitely win.\n\nI know that recently we have been passing through a number of crises.\nFloods, especially in the north-east, eastern India, south India and some\nparts of western India; landslides in many areas; people have had to face\nmany problems. Many people have lost their lives. I also express my\ncondolences to those families.\n\nAnd the nation stands in solidarity with the state governments in these days\nof crisis. No stone is being left unturned by either the state or central\ngovernment to provide relief measures to the needy.\n\nMy dear Countrymen, Independence Day is a festival to celebrate freedom.\nIt is an occasion to enthuse new energy by remembering our freedom\nfighters. This day is a harbinger of new inspirations. It reignites new fervour,\nexuberance and enthusiasm. And in times like now, it becomes even more\nimperative for us to be determined. It is an auspicious day because when\nwe meet again next year to celebrate, we shall be entering into the 75\nyears of our free existence. This is a momentous occasion. Today, all of us\n130 crores Indians have to make significant pledges for the coming two\nyears. And when we complete the 75 years of our freedom, we will be able\ncelebrate the redemption of those pledges .\n\nMy dear countrymen, our forefathers fought for this freedom with extreme\ncommitment, utmost integrity, sincere penance, renunciation and sacrifice;\nwe should never forget the way they laid their lives for Mother India. We\nshould never forget that during this long and dark ages of slavery, not even\na moment was lost when they were not moved by the desire for freedom.\nThere insn't a countryman who did not put his best foot forward aspiring to\nbreak free the nation from the shackles of slavery, by waging a war and\nmaking any sacrifice possible to bring this day. Many sacrificed their youth\nin jails. Many left behind their life's dreams and embraced the gallows. I\nsalute these revered martyrs who offered themselves as an oblation.\nIndeed amazing! On the one side, the country witnessed a phase of mass\nmovements and on the other side the resounding voice of armed revolt.\n\nUnder the leadership of Pujya Bapu, the great national awakening\naccompanied by mass movements, gave new impetus to the struggle for\nfreedom. And so today we are blessed to be able to celebrate our\nIndependence Day with such fervour.\n\nDuring this freedom struggle, several efforts were made to douse the fire of\nrevolt and throttle the soul and spirit of our motherland. Many attempts\nwere made to ruin the Indian culture, tradition, customs and heritage.\nRunning across centuries, that was the period of SAAM DAAM DAND\nBHED (either by hook or crook) – and all this was at its peak. Many came\nhere with the innate belief that they have come to reign the world for\neternity (yaavat chandra diwakaro-till sun and moon exist). But the strong\ndetermination to be freed beat such ambitions to dust. They believed that\nIndia was a divided lot due to the existence of multiple identities, nobilities,\nlanguages and dialects, cuisines, costumes and culture. They labored\nunder the misunderstanding that a country of so many diversities can never\nstand up as one against any force. But they could not recognize the soul\nand pulse of the country, that life force, that chord which binds us together.\nAnd when this force came out with full vigour in the fight for freedom, India\nsucceeded in throwing away the shackles of slavery .\n\nWe are aware of the fact that that was the regime when propagators of\nexpansionism spread across geographies and attained supremacy and\npower, but the freedom movement of India inspired many across the globe\nto stand against these forces. India became a pillar and ignited the fire of\nfreedom struggle all over the world.\n\nAnd those, who were involved in the blind race of expansionism, threw the\nWorld into two World wars, destroyed humanity, ruined lives and wrecked\nthe globe to achieve their designs.\nBut even during such a period, even in the midst of the destructive war,\nIndia did not abandon its urge for freedom; neither was it found lacking, nor\ndid it lower its guard.\n\nWhenever there was a need, the country has been making sacrifices,\nenduring sufferings and leading people’s movements. India’s battle created\nan atmosphere for freedom in the world. And the change that the power of\nIndia brought in the world, it became a challenge for expansionism. History\ncan never deny it.\n\nMy dear countrymen,\n\nIn the entire World, in its war for independence, India kept marching with\nits head high with its strength of unity, collectivity, the resolve for its bright\nfuture, its commitment and inspiration.\n\nMy dear countrymen,\n\nIn the midst of the Corona pandemic, 130 crore Indians pledged\nthemselves to become self-reliant. Today self-reliance is etched in the mind\nof every Indian. We are also witnessing the realization of that dream of\nSelf-Reliant India (“AatmaNirbharBharat”). “Self-reliant India” is not just a\nword, it has become a mantra for 130 crore countrymen.\n\nWhen I talk of self-reliance, all of us who are now above the age group of\n25-30 years surely recall how we were goaded by our parents and elders to\nbecome self-reliant as we attained an age of 20 - 21. Every family expects\nits children of 20-21 years to be self-reliant. As we are just one step away\nfrom the 75th Anniversary of Independence, it is essential for a country like\nIndia to stand own its own, and to become self reliant. What is necessary\nfor a family is also essential for a country. I have full faith that India will\nrealize this dream. And the reason for this is the strength of my country’s\ncitizens in which I have full faith, I am proud of their talent, I have\nconfidence in our youth and the country’s unparalleled women power. I\nhave faith in the thinking, in the approach of India. And history is witness\nthat whenever India resolves to do something, it does it.\n\nTherefore, when we talk about self-reliance, it arouses not only curiosity all\nover the World but also expectations from India. Therefore, it is imperative\nthat we make ourselves capable for realization of that expectation. It is very\nessential to prepare ourselves.\n\nA large country like India is full of energy of youth power. The first condition\nfor a self-reliant India is self-confidence which is the foundation of\nself-reliance.\n\nAnd this has the power to give a new vision and a new energy to\ndevelopment.\n\nIndia has always followed the adage - ‘Whole world is one family’. Veda\nsays ‘वसध ु व\n            ै कुटुम्बकम ्’ and Vinoba ji used to say ‘‘जय जगत’ i.e. hail the\nworld. Therefore, the world is one family for us. So, alongside financial\ndevelopment, mankind and humanity should also get importance. And we\nfollow this dictum.\n\nToday the world is interconnected and inter-dependent. So, it is the need of\nthe hour that a vast country like India should increase its contribution to the\nworld economy. It is also India’s duty towards world welfare. If India wants\nto increase its contribution then she herself will have to be empowered; she\nwill have to be self-reliant or ‘AatmaNirbhar’. We must make ourselves\ncapable of contributing towards world welfare. If our roots are strong and\nwe are capable enough, we will be able to take steps towards world\nwelfare.\n\nOur country has plenty of natural resources. It is the need of the hour that\nwe start the value addition of these natural resources and human\nresources; and to take the country to new heights. How long shall we\ncontinue to export raw material to the world? How long will the process of\nexporting raw material and importing finished goods continue? So, we will\nhave to be self-reliant. We will have to resort to value addition of our\ncapabilities as per the world’s requirements. It is our responsibility. We want\nto move ahead in the field of value addition to contribute to world welfare.\nSimilarly, there was a time when we used to import wheat from abroad; but\nour farmers have done a wonderful job. And now India is self-reliant in the\nagricultural sector. Today India’s farmers not only supply the food grains for\nthe citizens of India but India is also in such a position that it provides food\ngrains to the other countries in need.\n\nThough this is our strength- the strength of self-reliance in agriculture-\nvalue addition is also necessary in this sector. Our farm sector needs to\nevolve in line with requirements of world; Value addition is required for our\nfarm sector\n\nToday, the country is taking several new initiatives. You see, we have\nopened up the space sector. The youth of the country is getting\nopportunities. We have liberated the agriculture sector from the shackles of\nlaws and have tried to make it self-reliant. When India becomes powerful in\nthe space sector, neighbouring countries also get its benefits. If we become\npowerful in the energy sector, India can help those countries that want to\ndispel their darkness. When the country’s health infrastructure becomes\nself-reliant, then India becomes a preferred country as a destination for\nhealth tourism. Therefore, it is necessary to see to it that ‘Make in India’\nproducts get appreciated in the world. History is a witness to the fact that\nthere was a time when the products made in our country by our skilled\nmanpower were used to get appreciated all over the world.\n\nWhen we talk about becoming self-reliant, then we do not merely refer to\ndecreasing the import demands. When we talk of self-reliance, it is about\nour skills, our human resources. When we start sourcing things from\nabroad, then our capabilities start depleting and consequently, it gets\ncompletely destroyed over generations. We need to preserve it and\nenhance that caliber of ours. We need to accentuate our skills, our\ncreativity and with that we need to touch new heights. We need to\nstrengthen skill development for a self-reliant India, for improving our\ncompetency.\n\nMy dear citizens, I know that when I talk about becoming self-reliant then\npeople raise several doubts. I do accept that there are millions of\nchallenges while we travel on the path of becoming self-reliant and these\nchallenges increase further in a competitive world. We should realise that\nfor the millions of challenges we face, our nation has the capability to\nprovide billions of solutions. My countrymen are there with the capability to\nresolve the issues.\n\nYou can see that in the challenging times of Corona, we were in need of\nmany items which we needed to import but the world was unable to provide\nthem. The youth of our nation, our entrepreneurs, the industry accepted the\nchallenge. The nation that never manufactured N-95, started doing so. We\nstarted production of PPE which was not being produced before, similarly\nwe started producing ventilators in India, which were not being made here\nbefore. We are not only able to meet our own requirements, but now also\nbecome strong enough to export to the world. We can very well see how a\nself-reliant India can help the world. Therefore it is also the duty of India to\nwork for the welfare of the world.\n\nEnough is enough. What should be the mind-set of independent India? The\nmind-set of independent India should be ‘Vocal for Local’. We should take\npride in our local products. If we do not praise and support our indigenous\nproducts, then how will they get an opportunity to flourish and improve, how\nwill they gain strength? Come, let’s pledge that as we move towards the\n75th year of our independence, we shall adopt the talisman of ‘Vocal for\nLocal’ and together let's strengthen ourselves.\n\nMy dear Countrymen, we have clearly seen how our nation can do\nwonders, how it progresses. Who could have imagined that lakhs and\ncrores of money would be directly transferred to the Jan-Dhan accounts of\nthe poor? Who could have imagined that so many changes would be made\nin the APMC Act for the welfare of farmers? Who could have thought that\nthe farmers who were living under the Damocles’ sword of the Essential\nCommodities Act, would be freed of it after so many years? Could we have\nimagined that the space sector would be laid open for the youth of our\nnation? Today we are witnessing that National Education Policy, One\nNation-One Ration Card, One Nation-One Grid, One Nation-One Tax,\nInsolvency and Bank Bankruptcy Code and the effort for merger of banks-\nall these things have become the reality of nation, fact for our nation.\n\nThe world is looking at the outcomes of the reforms that are taking place in\nIndia in these times. The world is closely observing the reforms we are\nbringing one after another, one linked to another. As a result of this Foreign\nDirect Investment (FDI) in India has broken all its previous records last\nyear.\n\nLast year, there has been an 18% increase in FDI in India. So, even during\nthe corona pandemic, top companies of the world are turning to India. This\nconfidence hasn’t been created just like that. The world didn’t get\nfascinated with India without a reason. This confidence has grown because\nof the hard work put in by India in the field of its policies, democracy and\nstrengthening the foundation of its economy.\n\nToday many businesses of the world are viewing India as the hub of the\nsupply chain. So now, we have to move ahead with the mantra of ‘Make for\nWorld’ alongside ‘Make in India’.\n\nTry to recall what happened recently and take pride in the capabilities of\n130 crore countrymen. During this corona pandemic, there were cyclones\nin the east and the west coasts of India, umpteen number of people died\nbecause of lightning & landslides, and earthquakes of small intensity were\nfelt time and again. As if these were not enough, swarms of locust created\nhavoc for our farmers. A series of adversities struck one after another. Yet,\nthe country didn’t lose confidence and continued to move forward with\nself-confidence.\nToday, it is our priority to pull the people and the economy of our country\nout of this corona pandemic. The National Infrastructure Pipeline Project\nwill play an important role in this endeavour. Rs 110 lakh crore will be spent\non this project. For this, about seven thousand projects have been\nidentified in different sectors. This will also give a new direction and a fresh\nmomentum to the overall infrastructure development of the country. It is\noften said that during crises, the emphasis should be given on\ninfrastructure so that economic activity is speeded up and people get\nemployment and it generates a cascading effect. Both small and large\nenterprises, farmers and the middle class benefit to a great extent.\n\nAnd I want to recall one incident today. When Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the\nPrime Minister, he had started a programme with far-reaching impact called\nthe Golden Quadrilateral. He had taken the road network infrastructure to\nthe next generation level. Even today, the country looks at the ‘golden\nquadrilateral’ with pride and feels yes, our country is transforming.\n\nMy dear countrymen,\n\nAtal ji had done this work in his time but now we have to carry it forward.\nWe must give it a new thrust. We cannot work in silos. We do not need a\nsituation where in the infrastructure sector, road sector will work only for\nroads and the rail sector will work only for rail. There is no coordination\nbetween the railways and the roadways, between the airport and the port,\nbetween the railway station and the bus station– this sort of situation is not\ndesirable. We must ensure that the infrastructure is a comprehensive and\nan integrated one. It should be complementary to each other. The rail\nshould be complementary to the road, the road to sea port and the sea port\nto the airport. We are moving towards a multi-modal connectivity\ninfrastructure for the new century. And this will give a new dimension. We\nhave started the work with a great dream. And I believe that by eliminating\nsilos, we will give a new strength to all these systems.\n\nAlong with this, our coastline has a very important significance in the world\ntrade. While moving on with Port led development, in the coming days, we\nwill focus on working towards building a modern state-of-art infrastructure\ntowards the construction of four lane road across the entire coastline.\n\nMy dear countrymen,\n\nOur scriptures said something very profound. It is said in our scriptures\nthat- 'Samarthya mulam Swatantryam, Shram mulam Vaibhavam' means\n'Capability is the source of freedom, and labour force is the source of\ngrandeur, prosperity and progress of any nation.\n\nTherefore, nothing can match the hard work of the common man, be it\ncities or villages. When a toiling society gets amenities, the struggles of life\nease, everyday troubles are reduced and this helps in boosting their energy\npaying rich dividends.\n\nIn the last six years, several campaigns have been launched to improve the\nlives of the toiling citizens of the country be it about their own bank\naccounts, owning a pucca house, construction of such a large number of\ntoilets, providing electricity connection in every house, providing a gas\nconnection to free our mothers and sisters from the smoke, making efforts\nto provide insurance protection to the poorest of the poor, Ayushman\nBharat Yojna to provide free treatment of upto five lakh rupees in the best\nof hospitals, connecting Ration shops through digital technology. A\nsignificant progress was made in the last six years to reinstate\ntransparency and remove discriminatory practices so that facilities reach\nevery poor person.\n\nThese instruments have also helped a lot in delivering the services\nseamlessly during the Corona crisis. During this period, we continued to\nprovide free gas cylinders to crores of poor families, irrespective of whether\nthey had ration card or not the kitchen flames of more than 80 crores of my\ncountrymen were kept alighted by supplying free food grains to the 80\ncrores countrymen; approximately 90 thousand crore rupees were\ntransferred directly into the bank accounts. Just a few years ago, this would\nhave been unimaginable that all hundred paise of a rupee disbursed from\nDelhi would reach the account of the poor. It was indeed beyond one's\nimagination hitherto.\n\nGarib Kalyan Rojgar Abhiyan has been launched to generate employment\nin their own villages. We trust that our worker friends will be re-skilling and\nupskilling themselves. Having full faith in their efforts, relying on the skilled\nmanpower, relying on rural and indigenous resources, we gave a clarion\ncall “vocal for local” and “re-skill and up-skill” in an endeavor to empower\nour poor and our country's labour force.\n\nSince the center of economic activity is the city, a scheme is being\nimplemented for workers like street vendors etc who come from off villages\nto the cities for their livelihood, for providing finances directly by the banks.\nLakhs of people have taken advantage of this in such a short span of time\neven during the period of the Corona crisis. Now they do not need to\nborrow money at high interest. The workers can now get their money with\ndignity and authority.\n\nIn the same way, when our workers migrate to the city, if they get good\naccommodation then their efficiency also increases. And keeping this in\nmind, we have formulated a major scheme for arranging affordable housing\nfor them inside the city, so that when the workers come to the city, they can\nfocus, deliver and progress with full faith and commitment.\n\nMy dear countrymen,\n\nThis is also true and we have seen that there are some segments of the\nsociety which get left behind, are not able to come out of poverty in the\ncountry’s march towards development, Similarly, there are some areas,\nplaces, terrains which get left behind. Balanced development is very much\nnecessary to make India self-reliant. We have identified more than 110\naspiring districts which are lagging behind compared to an average district.\nWe have to bring each and every parameter of those districts at par with\nthe country’s average. We are making every effort so that people of these\n110 districts, which are lagging behind, have access to better education,\nbetter health facilities and have opportunities for local employment.\n\nMy dear countrymen,\n\nThe priority of a self-reliant India is a self-reliant farming sector and\nself-reliant farmers. And we cannot ignore them. We have seen the\ncondition of farmers. Various reforms have been undertaken since\nindependence. We have to free them of all the shackles and we have done\nthat.\n\nYou can’t even imagine this. If you make soap, fabric or sugar in one corner\nyou can sell it in any part of the country. But not many people know that our\nfarmers could not sell their produce anywhere in the country and according\nto their will. He had to sell his produce at a notified area. We have\neliminated all those restrictions.\n\nNow India’s farmer will be able to breathe free by selling his produce in any\npart of the country or the world according to his own terms. We have\nemphasized on several alternative measures to increase the income of the\nfarmer. We are constantly working to reduce the input cost of the farming.\nHow can he be provided a solar pump instead of a diesel pump, how can\nthe producer of food become an energy producer? We are working in a\ndirection so that avenues like bee farming, fisheries, poultry, etc should be\nmade available to him so that his income gets doubled.\n\nTime demands that our agriculture sector becomes modern and there\nshould be value addition, there should be food processing, food packaging.\nAnd it needs better infrastructure.\n\nYou must have seen that the Indian government has sanctioned 1,00,000\ncrore rupees for agriculture infrastructure even during the Corona\npandemic. This infrastructure will be for the welfare of the farmers and they\nwill be able to get better prices of their produce, and will be able to sell their\nproduce in foreign markets. They will have greater reach to foreign\nmarkets.\n\nThere is a need to strengthen rural industries. Special economic zones will\nbe created in the rural areas. A web of agriculture and non-agriculture\nindustries will be created. We have tried to create FPO (Farmer Product\nAssociation) which will go a long way in their economic empowerment.\n\nBrothers and sisters,\n\nLast time, I had made an announcement for the Jal Jeevan Mission. It is\ncompleting one year. I am very proud to tell you that our dream of making\navailable pure drinking water to all the people is getting realized. The\nsolution to several health problems is directly linked to the pure drinking\nwater. It also contributes to that nation’s economy. That’s why we have\nstarted the Jal Jeevan Mission.\n\nToday, I am happy to say that everyday we are able to supply piped-water\nto over one lakh houses. And in the last one year, we have been able to\nprovide water to 2 crore families, especially to the tribals living in the forests\nand far-flung areas. A huge campaign has been run. And I am glad that\ntoday 'Jal-Jeevan Mission' has created an environment of healthy\ncompetition in the country. There is a healthy competition among the\ndistricts, among the cities and also among the states. Everyone is hoping\nthat the Prime Minister's dream of 'Jal-Jeevan Mission' is accomplished at\nthe earliest in their respective areas. The new strength of Cooperative and\nCompetitive Federalism has been associated with the ‘Jal Jeevan Mission’\nand we are moving forward with it.\n\nMy dear countrymen,\n\nWhether it is the agriculture sector, the small scale industries sector or the\npeople in services sector, almost all these people, in a way constitute a\nhuge middle class of India. The professionals from the middle class have\nmade a name for themselves in the world today. Our doctors, engineers,\nlawyers, scientists, from the middle class have made a mark in the world.\nTherefore, it is true that whatever opportunities that the middle class gets,\nthey make the most out of it and therefore the middle class needs freedom\nfrom government interference. The middle class must get more new\nopportunities and an open environment, and our government is constantly\nworking to fulfil these dreams of the middle class. The middle class has the\npower to do miracles. So the middle class families get the greatest benefits\nof Ease of living. Cheap internet, affordable smartphones or cheap flight\ntickets under UDAN scheme or our highways or Information ways - all\nthese things are going to increase the strength of the middle class. Today\nyou must have seen that the prime dream of the middle class person who\nhas come out of poverty, is to have a home; he wants an equal life. We\nhave done a lot of work in the field of EMI in the country and as a result, the\nHome Loan rates have become cheaper. When someone takes a home\nloan, one can get a rebate of about 6 lakh rupees, by the time the loan is\nrepaid. Recently, it was noticed that a lot of affected middle-class families\nhave invested their money (to buy a house), but could not get the\npossession of the house due to lack of completion of the schemes and\nthey were still living in a rented house. The Government of India has set up\na special fund of 25 thousand crores rupees to complete the incomplete\nhouses to ensure that middle class families get homes.\n\nThe rates of GST and the income tax have come down. Today, with these\nminimum establishment facilities, we are trying to take the country forward.\nBringing co-operative banks under the ambit of RBI, in itself is a guarantee\nfor safety of the money of middle class families.\n\nThe reforms undertaken in the MSME sector and the agriculture sector, will\ndirectly benefit these hard-working middle class families. Consequently, our\nbusinessmen and small entrepreneurs will get the benefits of the special\nfund of thousands of crores of rupees. The strength and energy of the\ncommon Indian is the big foundation of the Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan.\nRelentless work is going on at every level to maintain this strength.\n\nMy dear countrymen,\nEducation of the country is of great importance in building a self-reliant,\nmodern, New India, an India which will be prosperous and happy. With this\nthought, we have become successful today in providing the country with a\nnew National Education Policy after three decades.\n\nEvery nook and corner of India is welcoming it with renewed enthusiasm\nand a new vigour.. And this is the National Education Policy, which will\nconnect our students with the roots. Alongside, it will help them become\nglobal citizens. The students will be well-rooted and still touching new\nheights.\n\nYou must have noticed that a special stress has been laid in National\nEducation Policy on National Research Foundation because in order to\nprogress, the nation needs to innovate. Higher the stress that will be laid on\ninnovation and research, greater would be the strength to take India\nforward in this competitive world.\n\nWho would have thought that there would be online classes in rural areas\nand such a momentum would be created so fast? Sometimes, in the times\nof adversity, new revolutionary initiatives emerge with force. That’s the\nreason we have witnessed how in this pandemic situation, a culture of\nonline classes has emerged.\n\nYou can see how fast the online digital transactions are increasing. Look at\nBHIM UPI app…. Anyone would be immensely proud to know that we could\nmake transactions of Rs 3 Lakh Crore in the last month alone through\nBHIM UPI.. This is an excellent example of how we have accepted the\nchanging scenarios.\n\nIf you see, prior to 2014, only 5 dozen panchayats had the optical fiber\nnetwork. However in the last 5 years, 1.5 lakh panchayats are connected\nwith the optical fiber network which is helping us today, immensely. We are\nworking on the goal of taking it to every panchayat and this work is in\nprogress in the remaining one lakh panchayats. In these changing times it\nis essential that Rural India is also brought under the ambit of Digital India.\nThere is a surge in the demand of online facilities among the rural\npopulation. Keeping this in view, we had earlier proposed the extension of\nconnectivity to every panchayat and today I would like to assure you that\nwe have decided that we will connect all our six lakh villages, with the\noptical fiber network. As the requirements have changed, so have our\npriorities. In over six lakh villages, thousands and lakhs of kilometers of\noptical fiber would be laid down. We have decided that within 1000 days,\nwe will complete the work of connecting over six lakhs villages with optical\nfiber.\n\nIn this era of technology, our dependence on cyberspace is going to\nincrease multifold. However, cyberspace offers its own risks and threats.\nThe world is very well aware of these. It can be a threat to the social fabric\nof our country, our economy and can even threaten the development of our\nnation; we are very well-aware of that. India is very cautious and is\nplanning to take steps to combat these risks. Not only this, new systems\nare continuously being developed. In a short span of time, a draft of new\ncyber security policy would be presented to the nation. In the coming times,\nwe will have to integrate everything and then work within the framework of\nthis cyber security. We will formulate strategies to move forth.\n\nMy dear countrymen,\n\nWhenever opportunities were given to women power in India, they have\nbrought glory to the country and have strengthened the country. Today the\ncountry is committed to providing equal opportunities for employment and\nself-employment to women. Today women in India are working in\nunderground coal mines. Today, the daughters of my country are also flying\nthe fighter planes and touching the skies. Today India is among those\ncountries of the world where women are being included in the combat role\nin the Navy and the Air Force. We have taken the decision of providing 6\nmonths paid leave to pregnant women, liberating our Muslim sisters and\nwomen of our country from the suffering of triple talaq and the economic\nempowerment of women.\nOut of the 40 crore Jan Dhan accounts, 22 crore accounts belong to our\nsisters. During the Corona period, about 30 thousand crore rupees have\nbeen deposited into the accounts of these sisters. Around 25 crore MUDRA\nloans have been given, in which 70% of the loans have been given to our\nmothers and sisters. Under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, maximum\nregistration is also being done in the names of women.\n\nMy dear countrymen,\n\nThis government has also been persistently concerned about the better\nhealthcare for poor sisters and daughters. We have done a huge job to\nproviding sanitary pads at one rupee each in Janaushadhi Kendra. In a\nshort span of time, more than 5 crore sanitary pads have been delivered to\nthese poor women from 6000 Janaushadhi Kendras.\n\nWe have formed a committee to ensure that the daughters are no longer\nsuffering from malnutrition and they are married off at the right age. As\nsoon as the report is submitted, appropriate decisions will be taken about\nthe age of marriage of daughters.\n\nMy dear countrymen,\n\nIt is very natural that health sector draws attention in this period of Corona\npandemic. As such, the biggest lesson of self-reliance has been taught to\nus by the Health Sector during this crisis. And to achieve that goal we also\nhave to move forward.\n\nYou see, earlier there was only one Lab for testing in our country. Today\nthere is a network of 1400 Labs, spread in every corner of the country. In\nthe initial stage of the Corona crisis, only 300 tests could be conducted in\none day, but in such a short span of time, our people have shown that\ntoday we can conduct more than 7 lakh tests per day. We started with 300\nand reached 7 lakhs!\nWe are making continuous efforts towards modernization, construction of\nnew AIIMS and new Medical Colleges in the country. In five years, the\nMBBS and MD seats have been increased for more than 45 thousand\nstudents. There are more than 1.5 lakh wellness centers in the villages and\nabout one-third of them are already functional, which have helped a lot\nduring this Corona pandemic. The Wellness Centers in the Corona times\nhave helped the villages immensely.\n\nA massive campaign is going to start in the health sector from today and\ntechnology will also play a major role in it.\n\nThe National Digital Health Mission is also being launched from today. It will\nbring a new revolution in India's Health Sector. Technology will be used\nprudently to reduce the challenges in treatment.\n\nEvery Indian will be given a Health ID. This Health ID will work like a Health\nAccount of every Indian. This account will contain your details of every\ntest, every disease, the doctors you visited, the medicines you took and the\ndiagnosis. When and what was the report, all such information will be\nincorporated in the Health ID.\n\nThe National Digital Health Mission will eliminate all these difficulties\nrelated to appointment with a doctor, depositing money, making a slip in the\nhospital, etc. We are devising a system which will help each and every\ncitizen to make a better and informed decision.\n\nMy dear countrymen, there is a curiosity among everybody when the\nCorona vaccine will be ready. This is natural. This anxiety is there in\neverybody and everywhere in the world.\n\nI would like to tell my countrymen that our scientists are dutifully engaged\nin the laboratories. They are putting in great efforts. At present, testing for\nthree vaccines is in different stages in the country. Once we get a green\nsignal from our scientists, we will launch massive production of the vaccine.\nWe have made all the preparations. We have drawn an outline to ramp up\nthe production of the vaccines and to make it available to each and every\nperson in the shortest possible time.\n\nMy dear countrymen, there are different scenes of development in different\nregions in our country. There are some regions which are well developed,\nwhereas there are others which are left behind. I think this imbalance is an\nimportant challenge to make India self-reliant. As I said earlier, we are\nemphasizing on 110 ambitious districts. We want these districts to be at par\nwith the developed ones. Our priority is to create an ecosystem for\ndevelopment and improve connectivity.\n\nNow you see. The western, central and eastern parts of the country -- be it\neastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Northeast, or Odisha -- have abundant\nreserves of natural wealth. The people of these regions are very capable,\nstrong and talented, but there has been an imbalance in these regions due\nto the absence of opportunities. Therefore, we have taken several\nmeasures. We are developing Eastern Dedicated Freight Corridor,\nconnecting the eastern region with the gas pipe line, developing new rail\ninfrastructure and new ports. We are developing the entire infrastructure for\nthe development in a very holistic way.\n\nSimilarly, Leh-Ladakh, Jammu-Kashmir have been freed from Article 370. It\nhas been one year now. This one year is a major milestone in the new\ndevelopment journey of Jammu-Kashmir. This has been a year of providing\nbasic rights to the women and to the Dalits. It has also been a year for our\nrefugees to live a life of dignity. We have launched several campaigns like\nBack to Villages so that the villages get benefited. Today, the Ayushman\nScheme is being used in the best possible way in the region of\nJammu-Kashmir and Ladakh.\n\nMy dear countrymen, the true strength of our democracy lies in the elected\nlocal bodies. It is a matter of pride for us that the peoples’ representatives\nof the local units in Jammu and Kashmir are actively pursuing a new era of\ndevelopment with activism and sensitivity. I congratulate their “panch,\nsarpanch”(village headmen) for their active participation in this\ndevelopment journey.\n\nThe delimitation exercise is going on in Jammu-Kashmir under the\nleadership of a retired chief justice of the Supreme Court. We want early\ncompletion of the delimitation exercise so that there are early elections,\nthere should be Jammu-Kashmir MLAs, its own cabinet, its Chief Minister\nso that it can march towards development with a new vigour. India is\ncommitted to it and is making all efforts in this regard.\n\nWe have taken a bold step to meet the aspirations of the people of Ladakh\nby making it the Union Territory which has been their demand for the last\nseveral years. Nestled in the heights of the Himalayas, Ladakh is\nprogressing towards new heights. Work is going on for a central university,\nsetting up new research centres, new courses for hotel and management.\nPlan is also under way for the creation of 7,500 MW Solar Park. But, my\ndear countrymen, Ladakh has several specialties. Not only do we have to\npreserve them, we have to nurture them as well. As Sikkim has made its\nmark as an Organic State in the northeast, Ladakh, Leh and Kargil can also\ncreate their own niche as a Carbon Neutral unit. Indian government has\njoined hands with the locals of the region to create a new model of\ndevelopment as per their own requirements.\n\nMy dear countrymen, India has shown that the march towards development\nis possible by balancing the environment. Today India is inspiring the entire\nworld with its vision of one world, one sun and one grid, particularly in the\nfield of solar energy.\n\nIndia has established itself as one of the five countries in the world in the\ngeneration of renewable energy. India is both aware as well as involved in\nfinding solutions to pollution. We are leaving no stone unturned whether it is\nthe Swachh India campaign, smoke-less cooking gas, LED campaign,\nCNG-based transportation, or electric mobility. We are emphasizing on\nincreasing the use of ethanol to reduce pollution caused due to petrol.\nWhat was the condition of ethanol in our country five years ago? Five years\nago, there used to be only 40 crore litre production of ethanol. It has risen\nto five times in the last five years. Today, we are producing 200 crore litres\nof ethanol which is proving to be very helpful towards our environment.\n\nMy dear countrymen, we are working on a holistic approach to reduce\npollution in the select 100 cities through an integrated approach and\nmodern technology with people’s participation.\n\nMy dear countrymen,\n\nIndia can say this proudly that it is one of the very few countries where its\narea under forests is expanding. India is committed towards the promotion\nand conservation of its Biodiversity. We have successfully carried forward\nProject Tiger and Project Elephant. The Tiger population has increased in\nIndia. In the coming days, we are starting ‘Project Lion’ for the Asiatic\nLions. And under Project Lion the work on the required infrastructure for the\nprotection and security of Indian lions and in particular, the special type of\nhealth infrastructure required will be undertaken. And emphasis will be laid\non Project Lion.\n\nAlso, one more work we want to promote and that is - Project Dolphin. We\nwill focus on both types of dolphins living in the rivers and in the seas. This\nwill also give a boost to Biodiversity and also create employment\nopportunities. This is also a center of attraction for tourism. So, we are\ngoing to move forward in this direction too.\n\nMy dear countrymen,\n\nWhen we embark on an extraordinary journey with an extraordinary goal,\nthe path will also be full of challenges and these challenges too are\nextraordinary. Notwithstanding the recent adversities, there have been\nmisadventures along the border which threw a challenge to the country.\nBut whoever tried to threaten the sovereignty of our country right from the\nLOC to the LAC, the army of the country, our brave soldiers have given a\nbefitting reply.\nThe whole country is full of zeal, driven by conviction and moving forward\nwith unwavering devotion to protect India's sovereignty. The world has seen\nwhat our brave Jawans can do in Ladakh,, what the country can do to\ndefend its resolve. Today, I pay obeisance to all the brave men and\nsoldiers who sacrificed their lives for the motherland from the ramparts of\nthe Red Fort.\n\nBe it terrorism or expansionism, India is fighting against it valiantly. Today,\nthe world's faith in India has become stronger. Recently, as a\nnon-Permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, 184\ncountries out of 192 supported India. This is a matter of great pride for\nevery Indian. This is an example of how we have made our place in the\nworld. And this is possible only when India itself is strong, India is powerful\nand safe. With this thinking, work is being carried out on many fronts today.\n\nMy dear countrymen,\n\nWe are establishing deep relations based on security, development and\ntrust with our neighbouring countries whether connected by sea or land.\nIndia has been making continuous efforts to deepen its decades-old\ncultural, economic and social ties with its neighbouring countries.\n\nThe world’s one-fourth population lives in South Asia. We can create\ncountless opportunities for the welfare of such a large population through\ncooperation and partnership. There is a huge and significant responsibility\non the part of all the leaders of the countries in this region for the progress\nand development of such a vast population. I call upon all the people,\npolitical leaders, parliamentarians and intellectuals of South Asia to fulfil\ntheir responsibility. The peace and harmony in this entire region will be of\nimmense help to the welfare of humanity. The interests of the entire world\nare intertwined with it.\n\nToday, neighbours are not the only ones with whom we share geographical\nboundaries, but also those with whom we have close and harmonious\nrelations. It is my pleasure that India has strengthened its relationship with\nall the countries in its extended neighbourhood in the last few years. The\npolitical, economic and human relations with the countries in West Asia\nhave progressed manifold. Trust has increased manifold. The economic\nties, particularly in the field of energy sector, are very important with these\ncountries. There are a large number of people from India who are working\nin many of these countries. India is indebted to all these countries for their\nhelp to the Indian community during the Corona crisis by honouring India’s\nrequest. I want to personally thank them.\n\nSimilarly, our ASEAN countries in the east, who are our maritime\nneighbours, also hold special importance. India has thousands of years old\nreligious and cultural ties with these countries. The traditions of Buddhism\nconnect us with them. Today, India is strengthening its cooperation not only\nin the field of security but also in the areas of marine wealth with these\ncountries.\n\nMy dear citizens, India has as much commitment to make its security\napparatus & armies strong as it has for establishing peace & harmony.\nMammoth steps have been taken in the field of defence production, to\nmake self-reliant India. Recently, we have put a stop on the import of more\nthan 100 military equipment. From missiles to light military helicopters, from\nassault rifles to transport aircraft - all will be made in India. Our Tejas is\ngetting ready to equip itself as per the modern requirements, for putting up\na show of its majesty, speed and strength. Our borders and coastal\ninfrastructure play a pivotal role in national security. Today emphasis is\nbeing laid on connectivity in every direction, be it at Himalayan peaks, or\nthe islands of Indian Ocean. New roads are being constructed everywhere,\nfrom Ladakh to Arunachal Pradesh, keeping in mind national security.\n\nDear citizens, we have such a vast coastline. Alongside, we have over\n1300 islands. Keeping the importance of a few identified islands in mind,\nwe are developing them very fast. You must have seen, last week, five\ndays back, a submarine optical fiber cable project in Andaman and Nicobar\nIslands was dedicated to the nation. Andaman and Nicobar islands will now\nhave the internet facility just like Delhi and Chennai. Soon we will move\nforth in connecting Lakshadweep islands in the similar manner.\n\nWe are aiming at providing high speed internet connectivity to\nLakshadweep islands in the next 1000 days. Alongwith the security and\ndevelopment, the youth residing in the coastal area and near borders mind,\nwe are working on developmental projects and taking steps, starting a big\ncampaign.\n\nAbout 173 districts in our border areas, our coastal areas share their\nboundaries with some or the other nation’s border or coastline. In the\ncoming days, NCC would be extended in those border districts for the\nyouth there. We will train around one lakh new NCC cadets from bordering\nareas, and we will work towards the idea that amongst those, one-third of\nthem are our daughters. The Army will train these border area cadets. The\ncadets for coastal areas would be trained by the navy and wherever there\nis an air base, the air force will train those cadets. The border and coastal\nareas would get trained manpower for disaster management, and the youth\nwould also get skill training for making their career in the armed forces.\n\nDear citizens, last year in my address from the Red Fort, I had said that the\nprevious five years were for meeting the prerequisites, and next five years\nwould be for fulfillment of aspirations. In last year itself, the nation has\nachieved many big and important milestones. On the 150th year of\nGandhi’s birth anniversary, India freed its villages from open defecation. Be\nit the Citizenship Amendment Act for the refugees suffering due to their\nbeliefs, reservation rights for Dalits/Backwards/SCs/STs/OBCs, historic\npeace agreement in Assam and Tripura, appointment of Chief of Defence\nstaff for making the collective power of armies more effective, or the\nconstruction of Kartarpur Sahib Corridor in a record period, India has\ncreated history, it saw history being created, extraordinary feats were\nachieved.\n\nTen days ago, the construction of Lord Rama’s magnificent temple in\nAyodhya began. A peaceful culmination has been achieved to the age-old\nissue of Ram Janmbhoomi. The citizens of India have shown an exemplary\nrestraint and wisdom, and acted responsibly. It is simply unprecedented\nand a motivating factor for the future. Peace, unity and harmony- these are\ngoing to be the strengths of self-reliant India. This harmony, goodwill- this is\nthe guarantee of prosperous future of India. We need to advance with this\nharmony. Each Indian must sacrifice something or the other in the\nmagnanimous yajna for development.\n\nIndia will move forward with new policy, new customs in this decade. Now\nbanal won’t work. The time has gone when casual attitude used to suffice.\nWe are no less than anyone in the world. We will thrive to be the best. For\nthis, we need to work towards being best in manufacturing, best in human\nresources, finest in governance, and aim to make a headway while\nachieving the best in every field by the 75th anniversary of our\nIndependence.\n\nOur policies, processes, products- everything must be par excellence, the\nbest, and then only the idea of ‘Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat’ can be\nachieved. Today, again we need to take a resolve that we will fulfill the\ndreams of those who sacrificed their lives for our freedom. This pledge\nmust be for 1.3 billion citizens, for our future generations, for their bright\nfuture, for the self-reliant India. We must take a pledge, we must take an\noath, that we will contribute towards reducing the import dependence, we\nwill empower our small-scale industries, we all will be vocal for local. we will\ninnovate more, empower our youth, women, scheduled tribes, scheduled\ncastes, specially differently-abled, economically weaker sections, villages,\nbackward classes, and everyone.\n\nToday India has made impossible possible at an extraordinary pace. With\nthe same willpower, similar dedication, same passion, each Indian must\nmove forward.\n\nSoon we will be celebrating the festival of the 75th year of our\nIndependence in the year 2022. We are just one step away. We must burn\nthe midnight oil. This third decade of the 21st century should be the decade\nwhen we fulfill our dreams. Corona is a big hurdle, but not that huge that it\ncan stop us from moving ahead on the victorious path of self-reliant India.\n\nI can see the dawn of a new era for India, rise of new self-confidence, a\nbugle of echo of self-reliant India. Once again, I extend my heartiest best\nwishes of Independence Day to all. Let’s all come together, and raise our\nhands, and say with all the power at our command: -\n\nBharat mata ki Jai, Bharat mata ki Jai, Bharat mata ki Jai\n\nVande Mataram, Vande Mataram, Vande Mataram\n\nJai Hind, Jai Hind!"},{"year":2019,"pm":"Narendra Modi","party":"BJP","footnote":"English rendering of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s address to the Nation from the ramparts of the Red Fort on the 73rd Independence Day- August, 15, 2019","source":"Press Information Bureau","url":"https://pib.gov.in/","text":"My dear countrymen,\n\nOn this solemn day of Independence, many greetings to all countrymen.\n\nToday is also the festival of Raksha Bandhan. This centuries-old tradition\nexpresses the love of brother and sister. I extend my best wishes to all the\ncountrymen and all the brothers and sisters on this auspicious festival of\nRaksha Bandhan. May this festival filled with affection fulfil the hopes,\naspirations and dreams of all our brothers and sisters, and bring affection in\ntheir lives.\n\nToday, while the country is celebrating the festival of independence, people\nin several parts of the country are facing difficulties due to floods and heavy\nrainfall. Many have lost their dear ones. I express my condolences to them.\nThe State Governments, the Central Government and other organizations\nlike NDRF are striving day and night to ease the hardships and bring the\nsituation under control.\n\nToday, when we are celebrating this auspicious day of Independence, I pay\nmy respects to all those who gave up their lives, who spent their youth in\nprisons, who embraced the gallows, who instilled the spirit of non-violence\nthrough Satyagraha for the freedom of the country. The country gained\nindependence under the leadership of Bapu. Similarly, in the years since\nindependence numerous people have contributed for the peace, prosperity\nand security of the country. Today, I also salute the people who have\ncontributed to fulfil the hopes and aspirations of the people, for the\ndevelopment, peace and prosperity of Independent India.\n\nAfter the formation of the new government, I am humbled once again with\nthe opportunity to interact with you. It has not even been 10 weeks since\nthe formation of this new Government. But even in a short ten-week period,\nefforts have been made in all fields and in every direction, new dimensions\nhave been added. People have entrusted us to serve them so that they can\nachieve their hopes, expectations and aspirations. We are dedicated to\nyour service with complete devotion, without wasting even a single\nmoment.\n\nTo revoke Article 370 and 35A within 10 weeks is a significant step towards\nfulfilling the dream of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel.\n\nIn just ten weeks, we made big ticket decisions like bringing about a law\nagainst Triple Talaq to protect the rights of our Muslim women, making\nmajor amendments in laws to counter terrorism and to make it more\nstringent and powerful; transfer of approximately 90,000 crores of rupees to\nthe bank accounts of farmers who are beneficiaries of PM Kisan Samman\nNidhi Yojana.\n\nOur brothers and sisters from the farming community, our small\nentrepreneurs could never believe that they will ever be able to avail of\npension schemes and live a dignified life even after they attain 60 Years,\nwhen they are physically weak and need some support. We have\nimplemented a Pension Scheme to meet these needs.\n\nWater crisis is a big concern these days. It is being predicted that an\nimpending water crisis is staring us in the face. Anticipating such a\nsituation, we have announced the formation of a new dedicated Ministry of\nJal Shakti where the Centre and States will together develop schemes and\npolicies to address issues of water crisis.\n\nOur country needs doctors in huge numbers along with robust health\nfacilities. To fulfil this requirement we need new laws, upgraded\ninfrastructure, new thinking and create new opportunities to motivate the\nyouth to take up the medical profession. In view of this, we have formulated\nlaws and taken important steps to bring transparency in Medical Education.\n\nNow a days we come across incidents of child rights violation all over the\nworld and India will not leave her children vulnerable. A much warranted\nstringent law to protect child rights was needed and has been enacted.\nBrothers and sisters, you gave me an opportunity to serve you all for five\nyears from 2014-2019. We took cognizance of the struggles faced by the\ncommon man to avail the basic facilities. Over the past five years, our\ngovernment has been striving to provide the facilities to meet the daily\nneeds of the common man. Special efforts have been made to facilitate\nthose living in villages, and those who are poor, marginalized, victimized,\nexploited, deprived and tribals. We are working relentlessly in this direction\nto bring the nation back on track towards development. But times change.\nWhile 2014-2019 was a period of fulfilling your basic needs, the years from\n2019 and beyond will see your aspirations and dreams getting fulfilled.\n\nWhat should 21st Century India look like? How fast should it move? How\nextensively, should it work, what heights should it strive for- we are taking\nsteps one after the other by preparing a roadmap for the next five years,\nkeeping all these things in mind.In 2014, It was a new beginning for me.\nPrior to the election in 2013-2014, I travelled across the country and tried to\nunderstand the feelings of our countrymen. But everyone had\ndisappointment written on their face, everyone had apprehensions. People\nused to wonder if the country could change at all. Can the country change\nwith the change of Government? A sense of hopelessness had percolated\ninto the minds of the common man. This was the result of their experience\nover a long period- hopes did not last long, they sank into the depths of\ndespair very fast. But when in 2019, after five years of hard work, with only\ndedication to the common people, only my country in my heart, only my\nmillions of countrymen in my heart - with this feeling we kept on moving,\ndedicated every moment for that. When we ran for the office again in 2019,\nI was surprised. The Mood of the country changed. Despair had changed\ninto hope, dreams got linked to resolutions, accomplishment was visible\nand the common man had only one determination that he can change his\ncountry. Yes it was the feeling that We too can change our country and that\nwe cannot stay behind.\n\nThis feeling of the 130 crore citizens, this echoing of emotions gives us new\nthe strength, new faith.\nWe had started with the mantra Sabka Saath- Sabka Vikas , but within five\nyears, the countrymen have painted the entire mood of the nation with the\ncolor of Sabka Vishwas. The Trust and confidence that everyone reposed\nin us over the last five years will inspire us to serve the nation with more\nvigour.\n\nI have seen in the recent elections and I had felt then that this is an election\nin which no politician was contesting, no political party was contesting,\nneither Modi was contesting nor were friends of Modi contesting the\nelection. It was the people of India who were contesting the election, 130\nCrore countrymen were contesting the election. They were contesting for\ntheir own dreams. The real nature of Democracy could be seen in this\nelection.\n\nMy dear countrymen, the solution to the problems - along with the period of\ndreams, determination and accomplishment - we have to walk together\nnow. It is evident that sense of self-reliance develops when problems get\nsolved. Solution to problems encourages speed of self-reliance. When\nself-reliance occurs, self-esteem develops automatically and self-esteem\nhas very strong potential. The power of self-respect is greater than\nanything and when there is a solution, resolution, capability, self-respect,\nthen nothing can come in the way of success.\n\nAnd today, with that self-respect we are determined to move forward to\ntouch new heights of success. When we are trying to solve problems we\nshould not think in isolation. There will be difficulties. Half-hearted efforts\nmade with the aim of earning applause will not help in fulfilling the dreams\nof the country. We have to strive to remove problems from their roots.\n\nYou would have seen how our Muslim daughters and sisters used to live in\nfear with the sword of Triple Talaq dangling over their heads. Even if they\nwere not victims of Triple Talaq, they were constantly haunted by the fear\nthat they could be subjected to it anytime. Many Islamic countries abolished\nthis evil practice long time back. But for some reason we were hesitant to\ngive our Muslim mothers and sisters their due rights. If, we can abolish Sati\nPratha, if we can enact laws to end female foeticide, if we can raise our\nvoice against child marriage, if we can take strong steps against dowry\nsystem in this country, then why can’t we raise our voice against Triple\nTalaq? We have taken this important decision in the spirit of India’s\ndemocracy and constitution, to respect the thinking of Baba Saheb\nAmbedkar so that our Muslim sisters get equal rights; so that new\nconfidence is generated in them; so that they also become active\nparticipants in the India’s development journey. Such decisions are not for\npolitical gains. They guarantee a lasting protection to our mothers and\nsisters.\n\nSimilarly, I will give another example. What was the reason behind\nrevocation of Article 370 and 35A? This is the hallmark of this government.\nWe do not avoid problems, nor do we let them fester. There is no time to\ndelay or neglect problems. The work that was not done in the last 70 years\nhas been accomplished within 70 days after this new government came to\npower. The abrogation of Article 370 and 35A has been carried out in both\nRajya Sabha and Lok Sabha by two-thirds majority. This means that\neveryone wanted this decision, but perhaps they were waiting for\nsomebody to initiate the same and carry it forward. I have come to\naccomplish the task assigned to me by my countrymen. I work selflessly.\n\nWe are moving forward with re-organization of Jammu and Kashmir. For 70\nyears every government made efforts to do something.\n\nBut the desired results were not achieved, and when desired results are not\nachieved, there is a need to think afresh and take new steps. It is our\nresponsibility to see that the aspirations of the people of Jammu, Kashmir\nand Ladakh get fulfilled. It is our collective responsibility to give new wings\nto their dreams. This responsibility has to be shouldered by all 130 crore of\nmy countrymen. To meet this commitment we have made endeavours to\nremove whatever hurdles were there in the way.\n\nThe system that prevailed over the past seventy years had aggravated\nseparatism and given birth to terrorism. It had encouraged dynastic rule\nand in a way strengthened the foundations of corruption and discrimination.\nWe have to make efforts so that the women of Jammu & Kashmir and\nLadakh get their rights. We have to make efforts so that my dalit brothers\nand sisters living there, get the rights which they have been deprived of so\nfar. The rights enjoyed by the tribal people of India must also be available\nto my tribal brothers and sisters of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh. There\nare several such communities, like Gujjars, Bakarwals, Gaddis, Sippies or\nBalties- all such communities must be empowered with political rights. It is\nsurprising that in Jammu & Kashmir there were legal restrictions on Safai\nKaramchari brothers and sisters. Their dreams were trampled upon. Now,\nwe have freed them from such shackles.\n\nWhen India was partitioned, crores of people had to leave behind their\nancestral homes for no fault of theirs. Those who settled down in Jammu &\nKashmir got neither human rights, nor citizenship rights. There are people\nfrom hill regions living in Jammu &Kashmir. We intend to take steps for their\nwelfare as well.\n\nMy dear countrymen, peace and prosperity of Jammu & Kashmir and\nLadakh can be an inspiration for India. They can greatly contribute to\nIndia’s development. We need to make efforts to bring back their glorious\npast. The new system that has come into being after the recent step will\ncreate facilities that will directly benefit the people of the State. Now,\nanybody in Jammu and Kashmir, like the rest of Indians, can reach out to\nthe Government in Delhi. There will be no hurdles in between. We have\nput in place such a system. Our recent action to strike down Article 370\nand 35 A has been welcomed by the entire country and also by people\nfrom all political parties of the country, without exception. Some have\nopenly supported us while others give their tacit support. But some in the\ncorridors of power, in a bid to take mileage from vote-bank politics, have\nbeen talking in favour of Article 370. The country demands an answer from\nthose speaking in favour of Article 370, that if Article 370 and 35-A were so\nimportant.\nIf Article 370 was so crucial then why did ruling parties not make it\npermanent in the last 70 years despite having a majority? Why was it kept\ntemporary? If there was so much of conviction, you should have moved\nahead and made it permanent. This means that you knew all along that the\ndecision taken was not right. But you did not have the courage and the will\nto amend it. Concerns about political future kept coming up. For me, the\ncountry’s future is everything, political future has no meaning.\n\nOur constitution makers and great personalities like Sardar Vallabh Bhai\nPatel took these bold and important decisions even during those difficult\ntimes, keeping the goals of national integration and political unification in\nmind. The exercise towards national integration was a successful one, but\nsome difficulties have been faced because of Article 370 and 35A.\n\nToday, as I address the nation from the Red Fort, I can proudly say that\nevery Indian today can speak of One Nation, One Constitution and we are\ntrying to fulfil Sardar Sahibs dream of Ék Bharat Shreshtha Bharat. So we\nmust develop such systems which strengthen the country’s unity and serve\nas a cementing force, and this process must go on continuously. It should\nnot be merely an interim measure but a continuous process.\n\nThrough GST we have fulfilled the dream of One Nation One Tax. Similarly,\nwe successfully achieved the dream of One Nation, One Grid in the energy\nsector recently.\n\nLikewise, we have developed the system of One Nation, One Mobility card\nand currently there is a nationwide debate about holding simultaneous\nelections in the country. This discussion should be taken up in a\ndemocratic manner. We will have to add many such new ideas to realize\nour dreams of Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat.\n\nMy dear countrymen, the country has to achieve newer heights, the country\nhas to make its mark globally. For this we have to change the attitude\ntowards poverty alleviation in the country. It should not be treated as a\nfavour, but as oura dutiful contribution towards building a bright future for\nthe country because we have to free ourselves from the clutches of poverty\nat any cost. A number of successful efforts have been made during the last\n5 years to reduce poverty. We have achieved more success than before\nand at a faster pace. A little respect and support to the poor can boost their\nself-esteem and pull them out from the grips of poverty without any\ngovernment help.\n\nHe will be able to defeat poverty with his own strength. It is my poor\nbrethren who have the might to fight against any adversity. He fights\nagainst extreme cold with his clenched fists. We need to bow before his\ninnate strength to face adversities and help in eliminating the challenges of\nhis daily life.\n\nWhy should poor people not have toilets, no electricity in the house, no\nhouse to live in, no water supply and no bank account. Why should they be\ncompelled to go to the moneylender to take loans through mortgage?\nCome, let us make efforts to boost the self-respect, self-confidence and\nself-esteem of the poor.\n\nBrothers and sisters, it is over 70 years since Independence. All\ngovernments have done a lot of work in their own way. Every government,\nirrespective of the party, be it the central or the state, has tried in its own\nway. But still it is a fact that today almost half of the houses in India do not\nhave drinking water. People have to struggle to get drinking water. Mothers\nand sisters have to travel 2, 3, 5 km carrying the load of water on their\nheads. A large part of their lives is spent in struggling for water. Therefore,\nthis government has decided to emphasize upon a special task and that is -\nhow to ensure availability of water in every house. How does every house\nget water, pure drinking water? And so I declare from the Red Fort today\nthat in the days to come, we will take forward the 'Jal-Jeevan' Mission. The\ncentral and the state governments will jointly work on this 'Jal-Jeevan'\nMission. We have promised to spend more than Rs. 3.5 lakh crores on this\nmission in the coming years. Work should be done on water conservation,\nirrigation, rain-water harvesting, seawater or waste water treatment, and\n'Per Drop, More Crop Micro Irrigation for the farmers. Water conservation\ncampaigns should be launched, creating awareness in the common\ncitizens about water, arousing their sensitivity so that they understand the\nimportance of water; even the children should be taught about water\nconservation as part of their curriculum in their childhood. We must move\nforward with the belief that in the next five years we have to do more than\nfour times the work that has been done in the last 70 years for water\nconservation and to revive the sources of water. We cannot wait any longer.\nThe great Saint Thiruvalluvar ji had professed hundreds of years ago when\nperhaps no one would have thought of the water crisis and the importance\nof water.\n\nAnd then Saint Thiruvalluvar ji had said NeerIndri Amiyadhu Ulganein\nनीरिंडरी अमियद ु उलगनें meaning that if water starts disappearing, then\nnature’s processes get disrupted and eventually come to an end. This\ninitiates the process of total destruction.\n\nI was born in Gujarat. In North Gujarat, there is a jain pilgrim city called\nMahudi. Approximately 100 years ago there lived a Jain saint who was\nborn in a farmer’s family. He used to work in the fields but under the\ninfluence of Jainism. He became a Jain saint called Budhi Sagar ji Maharaj.\nHe left behind some scriptures 100 years ago in which he shared a\npremonition that there will be a time when water will be sold in grocery\nshops. Can you imagine that the words of the saint written hundred years\nago have actually become a reality now. What was predicted a century ago\nis now a ground reality, and today, we all are actually buying water from\ngrocery shops.\n\nDear countrymen, we are not to get tired in our efforts, nor shall we halt or\nhesitate in moving ahead.\n\nThis campaign on Water conservation should not just remain a government\ninitiative. It should become a people’s movement like our Swacchh Bharat\nAbhiyan. We have to carry forward this movement with the help the\ncommon man’s ideals, aspirations and efforts.\nDear Countrymen, our nation has reached a phase when we should be\ntransparent about everything.\n\nTime has now come that we should take challenges head-on. Sometimes\ndecisions are taken keeping in mind political advantage but they come at\nthe cost of growth of future generation of our country. I would like to\nhighlight the issue of population explosion in one Country from the aegis of\nthe Red Fort today.\n\nThis rapidly increasing population poses various new challenges for us and\nour future generations.\n\nIn our society, there is a section which is very well aware of the\nconsequences of the uncontrolled population growth. They all deserve\naccolades and respect. This is also their expression for their love for the\nnation. Before having a baby, they take a well considered decision whether\nthey will be able to take care of the child’s needs and fulfill his/her dreams\nby playing the role of a responsible parent.\n\nKeeping these parameters in mind, this small sections of responsible\ncitizens is self motivated to keep their family small. Not only do they\ncontribute to the welfare of their family but also to the good of the nation.\n\nThey express patriotism. I would like all the people of our society to watch\ntheir lives closely and see how much they have served their families by\nlimiting increase in family size. It is about how the family has moved\nforward in just a generation or two, how the children have got education,\nhow the family is free from disease, how well the family fulfils their primary\nneeds.\n\nWe should learn from them. Before a child arrives into our family we should\nthink - have I prepared myself to fulfil the needs of the child ? Or will I\nleave it dependent on the society? Will I leave the child un-nurtured? No\nparents can continue to give birth to children who are forced to live this type\nof life and therefore a social awareness is needed.\nThe people who have played this huge role need to be honoured, and by\nsetting them as examples we need to inspire the segment of the society\nwho are still not thinking on these lines. We need to worry about population\nexplosion.\n\nGovernments also have to come forward through different schemes. Be it\nthe State Government or the Central Government - everyone has to walk\ntogether to shoulder this responsibility. We cannot think of an unhealthy\nsociety, we cannot think of an uneducated society. In 21st century India, the\nability to fulfill dreams starts with a person, starts with a family. If the\npopulation is not educated, not healthy, then neither the home nor the\ncountry can be happy. If the population is educated, empowered, and\nskilled and has adequate means available to achieve the right ambience to\nfulfill their wishes and needs, then I think the country can fulfill these things.\n\nMy dear countrymen, you are well aware that corruption and nepotism have\ndamaged our country beyond imagination and entered into our lives like\ntermites. We are continuously trying to weed them out. There have been\nsuccesses also, but the disease is so deeply entrenched, the disease is so\nwide spread that we will have to keep putting in more efforts and that too at\nevery level, not just at the government level, and we need to keep doing it\ncontinuously.\n\nAll work cannot be done at one go, bad habits are like chronic disease.\nSometimes it gets cured, but sometimes it relapses. This too is a disease\nfor which we have taken many steps, eliminating it by continuous use of\ntechnology. Every effort has been made to strengthen honesty and\ntransparency at all levels.\n\nYou must have seen that immediately after formation of the Government,\nand also in the last five years the Government has removed many top\nofficials. All such people creating obstacles were told that the country does\nnot need their services anymore and they have been removed.\nI believe that there should be change in the system, but at the same time\nthere should be a change in the social fabric. Along with the change in the\nsocial fabric, a change in the mindset and beliefs of the people running the\nsystems is also very essential. Then only the desired results can be\nachieved.\n\nBrothers and sisters, the country has, in a way, matured after so many\nyears of independence.\n\nWe are going to celebrate the 75th anniversary of Independence. This\nFreedom is as precious to us as our ethical values, attitudes and\nsensitivities. Whenever I hold meetings with officials I’d always mention, I\ndo not talk about it publicly but today I feel like speaking out, I repeatedly\nexhort the officials that after so many years of Independence can we not do\nsomething about cutting down red tape and reduce the involvement of the\nGovernment in the daily life of the common man.\n\nThe meaning of an Independent India for me is to create an ecosystem that\ngradually reduces the involvement of govt. in the lives of its peoples. This\nwill give people the choice to decide about their own destiny and embark\nupon whichever direction they wish in the national interest, for betterment\nof their families and in the pursuit of their dreams.\n\nCitizens should not feel pressure of the government but at the same time\nduring a crisis the government must not be found wanting. The government\nshould neither be exerting nor wanting, but let us all move forward with our\ndreams. The government should be always standing by us, as a\ncompanion. In case the need arises, the people should be assured that\nGovt. is always there to back them up. Can we create such a system?\n\nWe have done away with several unnecessary laws and rules which had\nbeen rendered redundant. In the last five years I have abolished,\npractically, one redundant law every day. Perhaps the common man is not\naware of it, - abolishing one obsolete law each day means almost 1,450\nlaws have been done away with an aim to reduce the burden from the\ncommon man’s life. The (new) government has only completed ten weeks\ninto office, and already (another) 60 laws have been repealed with an aim\nto bring about ‘Ease of Living’. ‘Ease of Living’ is imperative for an\nIndependent India and we are committed to focus on ‘Ease of Living’ and\nwant to take it ahead.\n\nToday, we have made much progress towards ‘Ease of doing business.’ We\naim to reach the Top Five in the global ranking and for this there will be a\nneed for several reforms; anybody wanting to set up a small business or\nindustry, faces several small and big issues, - such as filling up several\nforms, going from pillar to post, he has to make visits to scores of offices,\nbut he still doesn’t get the requisite sanction. In attempts to unshackle this\nintricate web, bringing reforms after reform, taking the Centre and States\ntogether, taking along the city and metropolitan municipalities, we have\nbeen able to achieve a fair degree of success towards ‘Ease of doing\nbusiness.’\n\nAcross the globe there is a growing realization that such a large country as\nIndia, a developing nation, can dream big and make such a big leap. ‘Ease\nof doing business’ seems just a milestone; my ultimate objective is to\nachieve is ‘Ease of living’, - where a common man does not have to\nexercise himself to get Govt./Officials clearances, he gets his due rights\neasily and thus there is a need for us to proceed in that direction.\n\nMy dear countrymen, our nation must march forward, but the country\ncannot now wait much longer for incremental progress, we will have to take\na big leap, we will have to change our thinking. To make India reach the\nGlobal Standards we need to build modern infrastructure.\n\nNotwithstanding despondent attitudes, ordinary people always dream of a\ngood system. They like good things; they have developed a taste for it. So\nwe have decided to invest 100 lakh crore rupees for modern infrastructure\nin this time period. This will generate employment; will develop new\nsystems and various aspirations will be met. Be it Sagarmala Project or\nBharat Mala Project, modern railway stations, bus stations or airports, be it\nmodern hospitals or world class educational institutions, we want to\ndevelop the entire infrastructure. Now the country also requires seaports.\nThe ordinary people have changed and we have to understand that.\n\nEarlier, if a decision was taken on paper that a railway station was going to\nbe constructed in a particular area, there used to be a positive feeling for\nyears together that a new railway station would be available somewhere\nnearby. Times have changed now. The ordinary citizens are no longer\nsatisfied with just a railway station. They will immediately ask, “When will\nVande Bharat Express come to our area?” Their thinking has changed. If\nwe construct a very good bus station or five star Railway station, the people\nwill not say “well done”. They will forthwith ask, “When will the airport be\nready”? That means their thinking has changed. The people who were\nhappy with just getting a railway stoppage are now asking, “It is ok, but\nwhen is the airport going to open here?”\n\nEarlier people used to ask, “When will a metaled road be constructed in our\narea?” Now people ask, “Will the road be of 4-lane or 6-lane one?” They\nare not satisfied to metaled roads any longer. I think this is a very\nsignificant change for aspiring India.\n\nEarlier, even on seeing the electricity poles lying on the ground people\nused to be happy, thinking that the electricity had reached them even if the\npole had not been erected. But now even after the installation of\ntransmission wires and electric meters, people ask “When will we get\n24-hour electric supply?” They are no longer happy with just poles and\nwires.\n\nEarlier, when mobile phones were just in vogue, people were content that\nmobile phone had finally arrived. But now they discuss about data speed.\nWe have to understand this transformation of psychology and changing\ntimes. We have to move forward in many fields, with the Global Benchmark\nlike modern infrastructure, clean energy, gas based economy, gas grid,\ne-mobility etc.\nMy dear Countrymen, generally the governments of our country are\nidentified with what they have done in a particular area or for a particular\ncommunity or group. Generally, the government and the people went by the\nyardstick as to how much a government has given or to whom it has been\ngiven. This was considered as good enough. May be it was the need of the\nhour and a compulsion.\n\nBut despite whatever, however, whenever or whoever may have received in\nthe past, we now need to unitedly think about what dreams we want to\nachieve as a nation. Time demands that we live fight and move ahead in\nunison to fulfil these dreams. Keeping this in mind we have set a dream\ntarget of building a five trillion dollar economy. 130 crore countrymen can\nmove together even with small contributions. The target of 5 trillion dollar\neconomy may appear difficult to some people. They may not be wrong but\nif we don’t accomplish difficult tasks, how will the country moved ahead? If\nwe don’t take up difficult challenges how will we develop a mind set to\nmove forward? Psychologically also we must always aim high and that is\nwhat we have done. This is not just in the air. We had reached a 2 trillion\ndollar economy after 70 years of independence, after 70 years’ journey on\nthe path of development we could achieve just a 2 trillion dollar economy.\nBut within five years from 2014 to 2019 we reached a 3 trillion dollar\neconomy i.e we added one trillion dollars. If we succeeded in taking such a\nbig jump in just 5 years, then we can become a 5 trillion dollar economy in\nthe next five years. This must be a dream of every Indian.\n\nWhen the economy grows, it brings better standard of living for the people.\nOpportunities get created to fulfil the dreams of even of those at bottom. In\norder to create these opportunities we have to develop this mind set about\nthe economic sector of the country.\n\nWhen we dream to double the income of our farmers, when we dream that\nafter 75 years of independence each family, including the poorest of the\npoor, should own a house, when we dream that on completing 75 years of\nindependence each family must get electricity in their house, when we\ndream that on completing 75 years of independence each village of India\nmust have optical fibre network, broad band connectivity and long distance\neducation, these should no longer be seem to be dreams.\n\nWe must focus upon developing our maritime resources and blue economy.\nWe should empower our fishermen community. Our farmers, who provide\nus food, may become energy givers. Why should they not become\nexporters as well, why should the produce of our farmers not dominate the\ninternational market? We want to move ahead with these dreams. Our\ncountry will have to boost its export. Let us make every effort to reach the\nglobal market.\n\nEach district of our country has a potential equal to that of one country,\neach of our districts has the capacity equal to a small country in the world.\nWe need to understand this power and channelize this potential. And why\nshould each district not think of becoming an export hub? Each district has\nits own handicraft and each district has its unique specialities. If some\ndistrict is known for its perfumes then some other district may have saris as\nits distinct identity whereas some other district is known for utensils and the\nother district is famous for its sweets. Each of our districts has a diverse\nidentity and potential for global market.\n\nWe are trying to see how can we use zero defect zero effect in\nmanufacturing for global markets. If we focus on exports by making the\nworld aware of this diversity, and work towards capturing the world market,\nthen the youth of the country will get employment. This will give great\nstrength to our small scale and micro level industries. We have to increase\nthat strength.\n\nOur country can be a fascinating tourist destination for the world, but for\nsome reason, we have not been able to do it as fast as we need to. Come,\nlet all of us, the countrymen, take the decision to boost tourism in the\ncountry. As tourism grows, capital investment provides more employment\nopportunities. The country's economy also gets a boost. People all over\nthe world are ready to see India in a new way today. Let us think how we\ncan attract tourists to our country from the world over, how we can\nstrengthen the tourism sector and what arrangements should be made at\ntourist destinations. We should also talk about increasing the income of\nordinary citizens, better education for them, new employment opportunities.\nThere should be launching pads for the middle class people so that they\ncan realize their dreams. Our scientists should have the best facilities and\nresources, our forces should have the best weapons and equipment that\ntoo indigenously made. I believe that there are many areas which can give\nIndia a new strength to become a five trillion dollar economy.\n\nMy dear brothers and sisters, today the country has a very favourable\nenvironment for achieving economic success. When there is a stable\ngovernment, the policies are predictable and systems are stable, then the\nworld also starts having confidence in you. The people of the country have\nshown this. The world is also watching India's political stability with great\npride and respect. We should not let this opportunity go. Today the world is\nkeen to do business with us. It wants to connect with us. Today, it is a\nmatter of great pride for us that while controlling inflation, we are moving\nforward with an important equation to increase the growth rate. Sometimes\nthe growth rate may increase, but inflation is not under control. Sometimes\nwhen the inflation is under control, the growth rate gets affected. But our\ngovernment has not only controlled inflation but has also increased the\ngrowth rate.\n\nThe fundamentals of our economy are very strong. And this strength gives\nus confidence to move ahead. In the same way, by developing a system\nlike GST, and bringing reforms like Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, we\nwant to develop an environment of confidence. There should be increased\nproduction in our country, increased processing of our natural wealth, value\naddition, export of the value added products to the world. Why can’t we\nhave a dream wherein every country in the world imports some or the other\nIndian product, wherein every district of India exports some product? If we\ntake these two things into consideration, then we can also increase the\nincome. Our companies and entrepreneurs also dream of getting access to\nthe world market. By getting access to the world market, our investors will\nbe able to enhance the status of India; our investors will be able to earn\nmore; our investors will be able to invest more; our investors will be able to\ngenerate more employment. We are completely ready to encourage our\ninvestors to come forward for generating employment.\n\nIn our country, certain wrong beliefs have come into existence. We have to\ncome out of those mindset. Those who create wealth for the country, those\nwho contribute in the nation’s wealth creation are all serving the country.\nWe should not doubt our wealth creators.\n\nThe need of the hour is to recognise and encourage the wealth creators of\nour nation. They should receive more honour. If wealth is not created,\nwealth cannot be distributed. Further, if wealth is not distributed we cannot\nuplift the poor sector of our society. Such is the importance of wealth\ncreation for our country which we need to facilitate further.\n\nThose who are making efforts to create wealth, according to me they\nthemselves are an asset to the nation and must be empowered.\n\nMy dear Countrymen, today we are emphasising on peace and security\nalong with development. Globally, countries are gripped with several\ninsecurities. Death seems hovering in some or the other part of the world.\n\nIndia has to play a vital role in reinstating world peace. We cannot remain\nsilent spectators in the global environment. We are putting up a tough fight\nagainst terrorist organisations. In any part of the world, an act of terrorism\nshould be regarded as an attack on humanity. Therefore, I urge all forces to\nunite against those who promote and give shelter to terrorist outfits. India\nshould contribute in exposing these anti-humanitarian activities and is\nresolute to unite all world forces to end terrorism.\n\nWe want that India should play a crucial role in the war against terrorism.\nIndia should unite all forces to expose those who give shelter to terrorists,\nthose who encourage terrorism and those who export terrorism.\nSome terrorist organisations have not only targeted India, but are also\ndamaging our neighbouring countries. Bangladesh and Afghanistan are\nalso grappling with terrorist activities. In Sri Lanka, sadly, innocent people\nhave been killed en-masse inside a church. This is such a heart wrenching\nevent. Hence, we all have to unite and act proactively to bring security,\npeace and harmony in this sub-continent.\n\nOur friendly neighbour Afghanistan is also going to celebrate its 100th year\nof independence, four days from now. I would like to extend my heartiest\ngreetings to them on this auspicious occasion.\n\nIt is our clear policy that those who are spreading fear and fostering\nviolence must be razed to the ground. We have made this clear through our\npolicies and strategies to curb all such malafide intentions. We have no\ninhibitions. Our army, border security forces and security agencies have\ndone a commendable job. They always stand tall in their uniforms and\nguard us from all adversities. They have martyred their lives to ensure a\nbright future for us. I salute and I pay my homage to them. It is important\nthat we take timely steps towards reforms.\n\nYou must have noticed that deliberations are on since a long time to bring\nreforms in military infrastructure, armed forces and military resources.\nPrevious governments have also discussed the same. Several\ncommissions have been formed and all the reports have brought to light the\nsame issues.\n\nThere is hardly any difference, but this has been stated repeatedly. There\nindeed is coordination between our Navy, Army and Air Force. We can be\nproud of the arrangement of our armed forces. Any Hindustani can be\nproud of Indian Military. They also strive for modernity in their own way.\n\nBut the world is changing today, the scope of war is changing, the nature of\nwar is changing. It is becoming technology driven; in the circumstances\nIndia too should not have a fragmented approach. Our entire military power\nwill have to work in unison and move forward. Things cannot move\nsmoothly if anyone from the Navy, Army and Air Force is a step ahead from\nthe other two forces, while the other two are lagging behind. All the three\nshould move simultaneously at the same pace. There should be good\ncoordination and it should be relevant with the hope and aspirations of our\npeople. It should be in line with the changing war and security environment\nin the world and today I want to announce an important decision from Red\nFort. The subject experts on the issue have been demanding this for a long\ntime. Today we have decided that we will now have a Chief of Defence\nStaff- CDS and after formation of this post all the three forces will get\neffective leadership at the top level. The CDS System is a very important\nand compelling task in our dream to reform the strategic pace of Hindustan\nin the world.\n\nMy dear countrymen, we are lucky that we are born in such a period, we\nare living in such a period, when we have the ability to do something.\nSometimes it comes to my mind that when we were fighting for freedom,\ngreat men like Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru were competing for their\nsacrifice. Under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi, freedom fighters were\ngoing door-to-door, to awaken the country to realize their dreams of\nindependence. We were not born at that time. We did not get a chance to\nsacrifice for the country, but we have definitely got a chance to live for the\ncountry now. And it is a privilege that this period is like this, this year is very\nimportant for us. This is the festival of 150th birth anniversary of Bapu\nMahatma Gandhi.\n\nWe feel blessed to have such opportunity. 75 years of our Independence\nand the remembrance of those who sacrificed for the country, inspires us to\ndo something. We should capitalise on this opportunity. We, 130 crore of\ncountrymen, have to move further, to achieve the dreams of Mahatma\nGandhi, the dreams of freedom fighters of the country. We should make\nthe 75 years of independence and 150 years of Gandhi into a festival. This\nis a great opportunity for our inspiration.\n\nI had spoken about Swachhata in 2014 from this Red Fort. I am confident\nthat within next few weeks of 2019 itself India will declare itself Open\nDefecation Free. States, Villages, Municipalities, Media, everyone has\nstarted Mass-Movement regarding ODF. The government was nowhere to\nbe seen, people participated in the mass movement and the results are\nquite evident.\n\nMy dear countrymen, I would like to put forward a small request to you. On\nthis 2 October can we make India free from single- use plastic? Let us\nmove around, form teams and move out from home, school, college.\n\nRemembering revered Bapu, we should move out of home collecting\nsingle-use plastic from homes, streets, chowks, and drains. Municipalities,\nMunicipal corporations, Gram Panchayat should make arrangements to\ncollect single-use plastic. Can we take first big step on 2nd October,\ntowards making India free from single-use plastic?\n\nCome my countrymen, let us take this forward.\n\nI will request start-up organizations, technicians and entrepreneurs to see\nwhat we can do to recycle this plastic? Plastic is being used in making\nhighways. Many such remedies can be there. But to get rid of such\nproblems we have to initiate mass movement but at the same time we have\nto think of the alternate systems. I will request all shopkeepers along with\nmany sign boards in your shop please also put another one exhorting\ncustomers not to use plastic bags; that they should instead bring their own\ncloth bags or buy cloth bags for carrying their goods. Let us create an\nenvironment. We generally give gifts to people on Diwali. Why not pack\nthose gifts in cloth bags this year and every time? If people go to market\nwith cloth bags, that will be an advertisement for your company too. If you\ngive a diary or calendar nothing will happen. But if you give a bag, that will\nbe a medium of your advertisement. It should be a jute bag. It will help\nfarmers. The cloth bag will help famers. These are all small things. It will\nhelp poor widows who are into sewing. Our small steps can change the\nlives of ordinary people and we have to work towards that.\nMy dear countrymen, whether it is a five trillion economy dream or the\ndream of a self-reliant India, we are following the principles of Mahatma\nGandhi. Mahatma Gandhi’s ideals are relevant even today. So we have to\ntake forward our ‘Make in India’ mission. Shouldn’t made in India products\nbe our priority? Let us decide whatever is produced and available in our\ncountry should be our priority. We have to give stress on local products for\nlucky tomorrow; we have to go for local for bright future. Whatever is\nproduced in the village should be given priority. If it is not available in the\nvillage we have to go beyond that- to Tehsil, to the district and then to the\nstate level. I don’t think that one has to go outside the state to meet one’s\nrequirements. Our rural economy will get a boost; our small entrepreneurs\nwill get a boost; our traditional things will get a fillip.\n\nBrothers and sisters we like mobile phones, we like to send whatsapp\nmessages, we like to be on Facebook-twitter. But we can help country’s\neconomy through these means. Technology is useful for the people who\nknow its usefulness. Technology is helpful for the development of a modern\nIndia. Why shouldn’t we move towards Digital payment? Today we are\nproud that our RuPay card is accepted in Singapore. In the near future\nRuPay card will be accepted in more countries. Our digital platform is\nspreading steadily. Shouldn’t we stress on digital payment in villages, small\nshops and small shopping malls? For the sake of honesty, transparency\nand to make our country’s economy strong let us move towards digital\npayment. If you go to villages you will generally see boards put up by\ntraders saying “only cash, no credit please”. I will urge the businessmen to\ndisplay another board: “say yes to digital payment and no to cash”. We\nshould create an atmosphere like this. I will urge the banking sector and the\npeople from the business world to give emphasis on these things.\n\nIn our country the bulk of middle class and higher middle class are\nincreasing. This is a good thing. People go to various countries as a tourist\nwith their family once or twice in a year. It is good that our children get\nexposure. But today I want to urge all such families to think over whether\nthey will want their children to know their country as well, when it celebrates\nthe 75th Year of its Independence, which could be achieved after many\ngreat men and women had sacrificed their lives? Are there any parents\nwho do not want their children to be emotionally connected with the\ncountry’s soil, its history, its air and water? Do they not want their children\nto gather new energy from all these? We have to move ahead in right\nearnest. No matter how advanced we become, if we get cut off from our\nroots, we can never survive. Today from the ramparts of Red Fort, I am\nasking you one thing. This is to generate employment of the youth, to build\nan image of India in the world and to tell the world what India is capable of.\nIt is time you decide that before 2022, when India will be celebrating the\n75th Year of its Independence, we take our families to at least 15 tourist\ndestinations in the country. We may face some difficulties in those places\nbut still, you should go. There may not be good hotels. But, sometimes\nsuch difficulties also bring opportunities along. Our children will learn what\ntheir country is, when they visit such tourist destinations. The people who\ncan build facilities will also reach there and that will generate employment.\nWhy don’t we develop 100 good tourist destinations, why shouldn’t there be\ntarget of developing 2, 5 or 7 top class tourist destinations in every state?\nNorth-East of India has huge natural resources but how many universities\nmake that part of the country as their tourist destination? You do not have\nto spend much, neither do have you need to spend a lot of time; in 7 to 10\ndays you can visit within the country.\n\n A new world will come into being in the places you visit. You will get bliss\nin the life once we Indians visit the tourist spots of North-East, foreigners\nwill also follow suit. But, think over when we go out of the country and the\npeople there ask, whether you have seen that temple in Tamil Nadu and we\nsay ‘’No’’; then how does it feel. They would be surprised and say that they\nbeing foreigners, have visited that temple but you being an Indian have not\nseen it so far. So, before we go abroad we must know our country well.\n\nNow, I want to ask something from my farmer brothers. For farmers, for my\ncountrymen this country is their motherland. As we chant ‘Bharat Mata Ki\nJai” our hearts are filled with new energy.\nThe word “Vande Mataram’’ enthuses our hearts with a wish to sacrifice for\nthe country. A long history beckons us. But have we ever cared to think\nabout our motherland’s health? The way we are using chemical fertilizers\nand pesticides, it is damaging the health of its soil. As a farmer, as a child\nof this soil, I have no right to damage its health. I have no right to make my\nmother India sad nor do have I right to make her sick.\n\nWe would soon complete 75 years since our Independence.\n\nRevered Bapu showed us the way. Should we not cut down the use of\nchemical fertilizer in our fields by 10% or 20% or 25% and if possible\nshould we not launch a Muktikar Abhiyan (campaign)?. This would be a\ngreat service to the nation. This would be a great step in saving our Mother\nEarth. Your endeavour in saving our mother earth will also get blessings of\nthose who dedicated their lives chanting Vande Mataram in order to fulfil\nthe dream of achieving freedom for our motherland. Therefore I appeal to\nyou as I am fully confident that my countrymen will definitely be able to\nachieve this. My farmers will fulfil this request of mine because I have full\ntrust in them.\n\nMy dear brothers and sisters, professionals of our country are at a\ncommanding position globally. Their potential is very well recognised.\nPeople respect them. Be it space, be it technology, we have achieved new\nheights. It’s a matter of happiness of us that our Chandrayaan is moving\nspeedily towards that part of the moon where no one has ever reached.\nSuch is the mastery of our scientists.\n\nSimilarly, our presence was much less in the field of sports. Today young\nsons and daughters of my country in the age group of 18 to 22 are making\nIndia’s tricolor fly in various sports stadia. How proud that feels! Our\nsportspersons are earning laurels for the country.\n\nDear countrymen, we have to take our country forward. We have to\ntransform our country. We have to make our country reach newer heights\nand we have to do this collectively. The government and the people have to\nachieve this collectively and jointly. Our 130 crore countrymen have to do\nthis. Prime Minister of the country is also a child of this country like you\nand he also is a citizen of the country. We all have to work unitedly for this.\n\nIn the coming days about 1.5 lakh wellness centres and health centres will\nhave to be set up in rural areas. Setting up one medical college for every\nthree Lok Sabha constituencies will make us realize the dream of our youth\nbecoming doctors. Houses for more than 2 crore poor people have to be\nbuilt. We have to supply potable drinking water to 15 crore houses in rural\nareas, construct 1.25 km roads in rural areas. Each village has to be\nprovided with Broad Band connectivity and connected with optical fibre\nnetwork, also a network of more than 50000 new start-ups has to be raised.\nWe need to move forward with so many dreams.\n\nAnd, therefore, brothers and sisters, we the countrymen have to collectively\ntake our country forward with these dreams in mind and for this 75 years of\nindependence is a very big motivation.\n\n130 crore countrymen have their dreams, their challenges. Each dream\nand each challenge has its own importance. It is not that some is more\nimportant and the other is less important. It may not be possible for me to\ndelve at all the topics during this speech. So, whatever I could speak today\nand whatever I could not speak are equally important. If we move forward,\nwe should keep in mind that we have to take our country forward.\n\n75 years of Independence, 150 years of Gandhi and 70 years of India’s\nConstitution has been completed for realising the dream of Baba Saheb\nAmbedkar. We are also celebrating 550th Parv of Guru Nanak Dev ji this\nyear. Let us move ahead following the teachings of Baba Saheb Ambedker\nand Guru Nanak Dev ji as we have to build a better society and a better\ncountry as per the expectations of the whole world.\n\nMy dear brothers and sisters, we know that our targets are as high as the\nHimalayas, our dreams are even more than the innumerable stars. But we\nalso know that even skies cannot check the flight of our courage.\nThis is our resolve, our potential is beyond measure just like the Indian\nOcean. Our efforts are holy like the flowing Ganges and are ever\ncontinuing. Above all these things our values draw inspiration from our\nancient culture and the penance of our sages and saints. The sacrifice and\nhard work of our countrymen is our motivation.\n\nCome on, let us move ahead to build a new India keeping these ideals and\nresolves in mind. Fulfilling our responsibilities with a new confidence and a\nnew resolve to build a new India should be our mantra. Let us together take\nour country forward with this single expectation, I once again bow to\neveryone who lived, fought, died for the country.\n\nJai Hind.\n\nJai Hind.\n\nBharat Mata ki Jai.\n\nBharat Mata ki Jai.\n\nVande Mataram\n\nVande Mataram\n\nThank you very very much."},{"year":2018,"pm":"Narendra Modi","party":"BJP","footnote":"English rendering of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s address to the Nation from the ramparts of the Red Fort on the 72nd Independence Day- August, 15, 2018","source":"Press Information Bureau","url":"https://pib.gov.in/","text":"My dear countrymen, I convey my best wishes to all of you on this\nauspicious occasion of Independence Day. Today, the country is brimming\nwith self-confidence. The country is scaling new heights by working\nextremely hard, with a resolve to realize its dreams. Today’s dawn has\nbrought a new spirit, a new enthusiasm, a new zeal and a new energy with\nit.\n\nMy dear countrymen, in our country, there is a Neelakurinji flower which\nblooms once every 12 years. This year, Neelakurinji is in full bloom on the\nhills of Southern Nilgiri like the Ashok Chakra (the wheel of Ashoka) in the\nTricolour on our Independence Day.\n\nMy dear countrymen, we are celebrating this festival of independence at a\ntime when our daughters from the states of Uttarakhand, Himachal\nPradesh, Manipur, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, have come back after\ncircumnavigating the seven seas. They have returned after unfurling the\nTricolour in the seven seas, colouring their waters with the hues of our\nTricolor.\n\nMy dear countrymen, we are celebrating this festival of independence at a\ntime when the Mount Everest has been conquered many times; several\nbrave-hearts and many of our daughters have unfurled the Tricolour atop\nthe Mount Everest. However, during this festival of independence, I will\nremember our young tribal children from remote forest areas, who have\nunfurled the Tricolour on the Mount Everest, further enhancing its glory.\n\nMy dear countrymen, the sessions of the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha\nhave concluded recently, and you would have seen that the proceedings\nwere conducted in a very orderly manner, and in a way, they were entirely\ndedicated to the cause of social justice.\n\nDisplaying utmost sensitivity and alertness, our Parliament has made the\nsocial justice framework stronger to protect the interests of the weaker\nsections of society – be it a Dalit, a deprived or exploited person or women.\n\nThe demand to confer constitutional status on the OBC Commission had\nexisted for years. This time, our Parliament has accorded Constitutional\nstatus to this Commission, and in doing so, has made an efforts to protect\nthe interests of the Backward and the Most Backward classes.\n\nToday, we are celebrating the festival of independence at a time when\nnews reports have brought in a new consciousness in the country. Today,\nevery Indian, living in any nook and corner of the world, takes pride in the\nfact that India has become the sixth largest economy of the world. We are\ncelebrating this Independence Day in a positive atmosphere amidst such\npositive chain of events.\n\nUnder the leadership of respected Bapu, lakhs of people sacrificed their\nlives and spent their youth in prisons to win freedom for our country. Many\ngreat revolutionaries embraced the gallows bravely. Today on behalf of my\ncountrymen, I pay homage to those brave freedom fighters and salute them\nfrom the bottom of my heart. Our soldiers and Paramilitary forces lay down\ntheir lives to uphold the dignity of the tricolour that inspires us to hold our\nheads high through life and death. Our Police forces serve the country day\nand night to provide safety and security to the people.\n\nFrom the ramparts of the Red Fort with the Tricolour as witness, I salute all\nthe soldiers of the army, the para-military forces and the police for their\ndedicated service, valour and hard work. My best wishes are always with\nthem.\n\nThese days, we are receiving the news of good rainfall as well as floods\nfrom different parts of the country. I want to reassure the people who have\nlost their loved ones and are in distress, that the country is with them in\ntheir hour of crisis to help them overcome this difficult situation. I share the\ngrief of those who have lost their near and dear ones in this natural\ncalamity.\n\nMy dear countrymen,\n\nThe next year will mark 100 years of the Jallianwallah Bagh massacre. Our\nmasses had sacrificed their lives for the country's freedom at a time when\natrocities had crossed all limits. The Jallianwallah Bagh incident reminds us\nof the sacrifices made by the brave hearts and is an inspiration to us. I\nsalute all the brave people from the depths of my heart.\n\nMy dear countrymen,\n\nOur freedom has come at a price. Under the leadership of Bapu and the\nrevolutionaries, many heroes, many satyagrahis, brave men and women\nand youth participated in the freedom struggle of the country. While striving\nfor the country’s freedom, they suffered imprisonment and spent the prime\nof their youth in jails, yet they nurtured the dreams of a glorious India even\nthrough all the suffering.\n\nMany years ago, the national poet from Tamil Nadu, Subramaniam Bharti\ntranslated his vision of the country into words\n\n“ए ला म ् अमर नलई आईडुमनान\n\nमरु ईअई इं दया उला ग र कु अ ल कुम”.\n\n– ( “Ellarum amarnillai aaedumnaan\n\n   muraiai India ulagirakku allikkum”).\n\nWhat was the dream that he envisioned after Independence? Subramania\nBharti said that India will show the way for the entire world to break free\nfrom every form of bondage.\nMy dear countrymen,\n\nAfter Independence, in order to realize the dreams of such great\npersonalities, to meet the aspirations of freedom fighters and to fulfill the\nhopes and expectations of the citizens of the country, India drafted an\ninclusive Constitution under the leadership of respected Baba Saheb\nAmbedkar ji. This inclusive Constitution is the harbinger of a resolve to\nbuild a New India. It has brought with it some responsibilities for us and\nhas also set a few boundaries on us. Our Constitution has been guiding us\nin realizing our dreams by stating that every section of the society and\nevery geographical part of India must get an equal opportunity in the quest\nto forge ahead.\n\nDear brothers and sisters,\n\nThe Constitution also guides us to draw inspiration from our Tricolor. It\nindicates that we should ensure justice for the poor, equal opportunity for\nall to move ahead, our lower middle class, middle class and higher middle\nclass should not face any obstacle in their growth, the Government should\nnot come in the way, social systems should not curb their dreams. We\nshould create an enabling environment that provides them maximum\nopportunities to grow and blossom, and they should be allowed to flourish\nwithout limitation.\n\nBe it our elderly, differently-abled, our women, marginalized or deprived\npeople, or our Adivasi brethren living in the forests, everyone must get an\nopportunity to grow, as per their hopes and aspirations. We aspire for an\nIndia that is strong and self-reliant, a nation that maintains a steady pace of\nprogress, an India that keeps scaling new heights; an India that enjoys\ngoodwill in the world. Not only this, we want that India should also shine in\nthe world – we want to build such an India.\nMy dear countrymen, I have shared my vision for TEAM INDIA earlier too.\nWhen 125 crore countrymen become partners, then each and every citizen\njoins us in the progress of the country. When 125 crore dreams, 125 crore\nresolves, 125 crore efforts, move in the right direction to attain desired\ngoals then nothing is unattainable.\n\nDear brothers and sisters, with utmost humility and respect, I would like to\nshare that in 2014, 125 crore citizens did not rest after voting for the\nGovernment. The citizens did not stop at government formation, but\nworked to build the nation. They have come together, were together and\nwill continue to be together. I feel that this synergy of 125 crore active\ncitizens from more than 6 lakhs villages is the real strength of our nation.\nToday, we celebrate the birth anniversary of Shri Aurobindo. He said\nsomething very pertinent – What is Nation? What is our Motherland? It is\nnot a mere piece of land, not just an identity, nor is it a figment of\nimagination. The Nation is a repository of a great force manifested through\nmany organized units to give it a concrete shape. It is this thought of Sri\nAurobindo which is uniting the country and taking it ahead. That we are\nactually moving ahead is difficult to comprehend unless we know from\nwhere we started. If we don’t look at from where we began our journey, it\nwill not be possible to assess how far we have come. Precisely for this\nreason, if we consider 2013 as the base year and take into consideration\nthe work that has been done in the last four years, you will be surprised to\nsee the speed at which the country is moving and the pace at which the\nprogress is being made. Take the case of toilets. If we had continued with\nthe same speed of constructing toilets as in 2013, then to achieve 100%\ntarget would have taken decades.\n\nIf we talk about providing electricity to villages on the basis of work done in\n2013, it would have taken a couple of more decades to accomplish this\nwork. If we talk about providing smoke free LPG gas connection to the poor\nand to the poor mothers, at the rate in which it was done in 2013, it could\nnot have been completed even in a 100 years. If we had maintained the\nspeed of 2013 in laying optical fibre network in villages, then we would not\nhave been able to accomplish the task for generations together. We will\nstrive to maintain the same pace of development.\n\nBrothers and sisters, the country has huge expectations, the country has a\nlot of requirements and to fulfill those, it is imperative for the central\ngovernment and the state governments to work together steadily and\ncontinuously. Today, we can see a sea change in the country although the\ncountry is same, the soil is same, the wind is same, the sky is same, the\nsea is same, the government offices are same, the files are same and the\ndecision making process remains the same. However, the country has\nbeen experiencing change for the last four years. A new spirit, new energy,\nnew resolve, new determination and new inspiration is taking the country\nforward. This is why the country has doubled the pace of construction of\nthe highways. The construction of new houses has gone up four times in\nthe villages. The food production in the country today has reached an\nall-time high; there has been a record production of mobile phones; the\nsale of tractors has touched a new high. On the one hand, a record\nnumber of tractors are being bought by our farmers today, at the same\ntime, the country has witnessed a record number of aeroplane purchases\nsince independence. Toilets are being built in schools; new IIMs, new IITs\nand new AIIMS are being established. Giving momentum to Skill\nDevelopment Missions, the country is setting up new centers in small\ntowns. At the same time, our tier-2 and tier-3 cities are being flooded with\nstart-up enterprises, bringing regeneration.\n\nBrothers and Sisters, Digital India is now making inroads into our villages.\nAs a government sensitive to the needs of people, efforts are being made\nto turn Digital India into a reality. At the same time, work is also progressing\nwith the same dedication to compile dictionary and common signs for my\ndifferently-abled brothers and sisters. While on the one hand, our farmers\nare working on modern agricultural techniques like micro irrigation, drip\nirrigation and sprinklers, on the other hand, 99 big closed irrigation projects\nhave also been revived. Our soldiers reach out to provide relief and rescue\noperations during natural calamities. While our soldiers display exemplary\ncourage in reaching out to rescue the people in difficulties, they have also\nshown a steely resolve to carry out surgical strikes and vanquish our\nenemies.\n\nTake a glance at the vast canvass of the development in our country- from\none end to the other, one can witness the progress of the country that is\nmoving ahead with new energy and enthusiasm. I hail from Gujarat. There\nis a saying in Gujarati ‘Nishan Chuk Maaf Lekin Nahi Maaf Nichu Nishan’\nwhich means one should have big aims and dreams. However, for that, one\nhas to strive hard and be answerable. But if the aims are not big, targets\nare not far-sighted, decisions are also not taken. Development comes to a\nhalt. That is why my dear brothers and sisters, it is necessary for us to\nmove ahead with big aims and resolve. When targets are vague, when the\nspirit is not strong, then important decisions in our social life also get held\nup for years. Take for instance the case of MSP - economists, farmer\norganizations, farmers as well as political parties had been demanding, that\nfarmers should get an MSP which is one and a half times of their\ninvestment. The matter was debated for years, files moved to and fro, and\nbut was stuck. Finally, we took the decision. We took a bold decision of\ngiving the farmers the MSP which is one and half times their investment.\n\nThere was unanimity on GST. Everyone wanted GST but they could not\narrive at a decision because while on the subject, they were thinking in\nterms of their vested interests and whether this will translate into electoral\ngains. Today, with the help of small traders, their open mindedness and\ntheir attitude of accepting the new, the country has implemented GST. A\nnew found confidence has been generated in the business community.\nThe small entrepreneurs, small businessmen who faced teething difficulties\nin adopting GST, accepted the challenge and the country is now moving\nahead.\nToday, we have enacted laws on Insolvency and Bankruptcy to strengthen\nthe banking sector. Who opposed them earlier? Taking decisions requires\nconviction, force, confidence and complete dedication to the good of the\ncommon man. Why was the Benami property law not enforced earlier? The\nBenami property laws are implemented only when there is courage and a\ndetermination to do something for the country. The Jawans of our defence\nforces were demanding one-rank one-pension for several decades. They\nwere not resorting to agitation because they are disciplined, but nobody\nwas paying heed to their voices. Somebody needed to take a decision in\nthis regard. You gave us the responsibility of taking this decision and we\nfulfilled it positively.\n\nMy dear brothers and sisters,\n\nWe are not the kind of people who work in the interest of the party. We are\ncapable of taking tough decisions because national interest is topmost in\nour priority.\n\nMy dear brothers and sisters,\n\nIn this era of global economy, the entire world is looking at every\ndevelopment in India - big or small, with deep interest and hope and\nexpectations. You may recall the comments made about India prior to\n2014, by eminent international institutions, top economists of the world, and\nby those considered authorities on the subject. There was a time when the\nIndian economy was considered risky by experts. But now the same\nexperts and the institutions have expressed confidence that our reform\nmomentum has strengthened our economic fundamentals. How have\nthings changed? There was a time when the world used to comment about\nred tape in India but now they talk about Red Carpet. We have reached\nthe 100th spot in Ease of Doing Business ranking. Today, the entire world\nis looking at this achievement with pride. There was a time when the world\nperceived India as a country with ‘policy paralysis’ and ‘delayed reforms’.\nOld newspaper clippings confirm this view. However, today the world\nopinion about India has changed and they talk about our focus on reform,\nperform and transform. This follows from a series of time bound policy\ndecisions. There was a time when the world counted India among the\n‘fragile five’. They were concerned that India was pulling down the world\neconomy but now their tone has changed as India has become a\nmulti-trillion dollar investment destination.\n\nMy dear brothers and sisters,\n\nWhile engaging with India, the investors used to bemoan the lack of\ninfrastructure, the blackouts due to power shortage and the bottlenecks.\nThe same set of experts who had earlier dubbed India as a ‘sleeping\nelephant’ are now saying that ‘sleeping elephant’ has woken up and started\nrunning. Economists and international institutions are saying that India will\nprovide momentum to the world economy for the next three decades and\nwill spur the growth of the world.\n\nToday, India's stature at International fora has risen greatly. India’s voice is\nbeing heard in every organization of which she is a member. India is\nplaying a crucial role in shaping up the discourse and providing leadership\nto these organizations. We are raising our voice at international fora.\n\nMy dear countrymen, for years, we waited seeking membership to some\ninternational organizations, but today, our country has become a member\nof innumerable organizations. Today, India offers a ray of hope for those\nwho are concerned with environmental issues and global warming. Today\nIndia has become the flag bearer of International Solar Alliance in the\nworld. Today, every country of the world is keen to welcome any Indian\nstepping on its soil. A new consciousness is visible in their eyes, when they\nlook at an Indian. The strength of the Indian passport has multiplied\nmanifold. This has instilled a new self-confidence, fresh energy and a\nresolve in every Indian to move ahead with new hope.\nMy dear countrymen, if an Indian is in trouble or distress in any part of the\nworld, he can rest assured that his country is with him at every step.\nSeveral recent incidents bear testimony to this fact.\n\nMy dear countrymen, just as the perspective of the world towards India has\ntransformed, similarly, there was a time when the news from India's\nNorth-Eastern part used to be dominated with content that one wished\nwere not there. However, today my dear brothers and sisters, North-East is\ncoming up with positive and inspiring stories. North-East today is shining in\nthe field of sports.\n\nMy dear brothers and sisters, today we are receiving news from North-East\nthat the last village has been electrified and the entire village danced the\nwhole night. We are hearing more such news from the North East about\nhighways, railways, airways, waterways and information ways (i-ways)\ncoming to the region. The work of installing electric transmission lines\nacross the North-East is progressing at a rapid pace. Today youth from the\nNorth-East are establishing BPOs in the region. Today, new educational\ninstitutions are being set up and the North-East India is becoming the new\nhub for organic farming. North-East is going to host the Sports University.\n\nBrothers and sisters, there was a time when the North-East used to feel\nthat Delhi is very distant. Within four years, we have brought Delhi to the\ndoorsteps of North-East.\n\nBrothers and sisters, today, about 65% of the population in the country is\nbelow 35 years of age. We are proud of our country's youth. Our country's\nyoungsters have completely transformed the meaning of all standards of\nthe economy. They have infused new colours to the country's standard of\nprogress. There was a time when only big cities used to hog all the\nlimelight. Today, our country is talking about Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities and\npaying attention to the youngsters engaged in modern agriculture in the\nrural areas. The youth of our country has completely transformed the\nnature of jobs. Today the youngsters of the country are taking the nation to\ngreater heights by exploring and engaging in new fields such as Start-ups,\nBPOs, E-commerce, mobility etc.\n\nMy dear countrymen, 13 crore Mudra Loans has been a major\nachievement. More so, if it includes 4 crore youth who have taken the loan\nfor the first time with the aspiration to become self-reliant and are\npromoting self-employment. This in itself is a great example of the\nchanging ecosystem. In an endeavor to realize the dream of Digital India,\nseveral Common Service Centres are being managed by young girls and\nboys in more than 3 lakhs villages today. These centres are rendering\n“on-the-click global connect”/”anytime-anywhere connectivity” services to\nevery citizen in the villages with the optimal utilization of Information\nTechnology.\n\nTalking about infrastructure, whether it be speed of rails, roads, I-ways,\nhighways or a new airport, our nation is witnessing fast paced\ndevelopment.\n\nBrothers and Sisters, scientists of our nation have also left no stone\nunturned in bringing immense glory to our country. In the global context, as\nwell as fulfilling the requirements of the country, it is a matter of great pride\nthat our scientists launched more than 100 satellites in one go leaving the\nworld astonished. That’s the capability of Indian scientists which has made\nthe world stand up and applaud. Successful launch of Mangalyaan in the\nvery first attempt itself stands as testimony to the expertise and endeavors\nof our scientists. This feat of successful in orbit launch of Mangalyaan\nspeaks volumes about the capabilities of our scientists. In days to come,\nthanks to the futuristic vision, innovativeness and creativity of our scientists\nwe are confident of launching NavIC, the first indigenous Indian Regional\nNavigation Satellite System (IRNSS). This navigation system will guide\nfishermen and other citizens through Satellite signals.\nMy dear countrymen, today from the ramparts of the Red Fort, I am\ndelighted to share a good news. Our country is undoubtedly progressing\nfast in its space missions. However, we have a dream; our scientists have\na dream. We have resolved that by 2022, when India celebrates 75 years\nof Independence or maybe even before that, certainly some of our young\nboys and girls will unfurl the Tricolour in space. With Mangalyaan our\nscientists have proved their capabilities. I feel proud to announce that very\nsoon as a part of our Manned-Space mission, we shall be sending an\nIndian into space. This will be done through the pursuit of our esteemed\nscientists, and we will proudly find ourselves as the fourth such nation to\nhave launched a successful Man Space Mission.\n\nDear brothers and sisters, I would like to congratulate our scientists and\ntechnicians for such a great accomplishment. Today our warehouses are\nfilled with food grains. I sincerely acknowledge the role of our agricultural\nscientists, cultivators and farmers in successfully steering the green\nrevolution across decades.\n\nBut my brothers and sisters, times have changed now. Our farmers and the\nagricultural markets have to face global challenges and competition. As the\npopulation increases, land falls short. Hence, the changing times demand\nthat our agricultural methods should also be modern and more scientific;\nwe have to take the process forward with technology. Precisely for this\nreason we are focusing on change and bringing in modern methods in the\nagricultural sector.\n\nWe have a vision to double the farmers’ income by the 75th year of\nIndependence. Some people have doubts, which is quite natural, but we\nare determined. Hum makkhan par lakeer nahi, patthar par lakeer\nkheenchne waale hain (We don’t promise things lightly, we mean to keep\nour word). To keep our promises, we have to work hard, we have to plan\nand we have to put our heart and soul into fulfilling it. So in order to realize\nthis promise by 75th year of Independence, we want to move along with the\nfarmers in that direction by bringing modernity and diversity in agricultural\nsector. We want to bring value addition right from seeds to marketing. We\nwant to modernize. Some new crops are giving record yields. For the first\ntime we are moving towards agriculture export policy so that our farmers\ncan also face global competition with confidence. Today we can see a new\nagricultural revolution. Organic farming, Blue revolution, sweet revolution\nand solar farming have opened up new vistas.\n\nIt is a matter of great satisfaction that today our country is the second\nhighest fish producer in the world and is on the verge of reaching the top\nposition soon. The export of honey has doubled. The sugarcane farmers\nare happy that ethanol production has tripled. It means, in rural economy\nother businesses allied to agriculture are also as important as agriculture.\nWe are developing village resources by spending crores of rupees through\nwomen self help groups.\n\nKhadi is associated with the name of respected Bapu. I want to humbly\nsubmit that the sale of khadi products since independence has doubled.\nThis has generated employment for the poor.\n\nMy brothers and sisters, the farmers of my country are emphasizing on\nsolar farming now. Apart from farming, they can earn money by selling\npower generated through solar farming. The people who spin charkha, the\npeople who are associated with handloom are also earning their livelihood.\n\nMy dear brothers and sisters, economic development in our country is\nimportant, but more than anything else, human dignity is supreme. Without\nhuman dignity, no country can move forward in a balanced way. So to\nprotect human dignity, we have to move ahead with those schemes which\nwill ensure respectable lives for people. The policies, traditions and\nintentions should be such that ordinary people, including the poorest of the\npoor can get a chance to live with equal dignity.\nSo we have provided gas connection to the poor through Ujjawala Yojana.\nWe have provided electricity to the poor through Saubhagya Yojana. We\nare emphasizing on moving ahead with the concept of ‘Shrameva Jayate’.\n\nOnly yesterday, we heard the President’s address to the nation. He\ndescribed in great detail the Gram Swaraj Abhiyan. Whenever, there is talk\nabout Government, it is said that policies are framed but there is no last\nmile delivery. The President described well how this campaign that was\nlaunched in Delhi has now spread to 65000 villages in aspirational districts,\nto the huts of the poor; how it is working in the backward villages.\n\nMy dear countrymen, when I talked about cleanliness from the Ramparts of\nRed Fort in 2014, some people made fun. Some of them even said the\nGovernment had many things to do, why is it wasting its energy on an issue\nlike cleanliness. But my dear brothers and sisters, in a recent report the\nWHO has said that because of the cleanliness campaign three lakh\nchildren were saved. The credit for saving lives of three lakh children goes\nto every Indian who was a part of this campaign. Saving the lives of three\nlakh children of the poor is surely a great humanitarian act and the world\nbodies are recognizing it.\n\nBrothers and Sisters, Mahatma Gandhi’s 150th Birth Anniversary falls next\nyear. Bapu during his lifetime attached greater importance to cleanliness\nthan even to freedom. He used to say we got our freedom because of\nSatyagrahisand Swachchata (cleanliness) will come from Swachchagrahis.\nGandhiji trained Satyagrahis and this inspired us to prepare\nSwachchagrahis. In the coming days, when we will be celebrating his\n150th Birth Anniversary, crores of Swachchagrahis will offer Karyanjali\n(offerings of work) in the memory of Bapu. In a way, they will fulfil his\ndreams which we are realizing now.\n\nMy Brothers and Sisters, it is true that because of cleanliness, lives of three\nlakh children have been saved. But no matter how happy a middle class\nfamily is and how well-to-do it is or how poor it is, once a family member\nfalls sick, the whole family suffers. On occasions generations are afflicted\nwith illnesses.\n\nThe Government of India has decided to launch Pradhanmantri Jan Arogya\nAbhiyan so that the poor man, the common man gets free treatment for\nserious diseases and he can be admitted to big hospitals free of cost. The\nPradhanmantri Jan Arogya Abhiyan and Ayushman Bharat Yojana will\ncover 10 crore families of the country. In the coming days, the people from\nlower middle class, middle class and upper middle class income groups\ncan also access health care services from these two programs. There is a\nprovision of giving five lakh rupees per annum health assurance for each\nfamily. It means about fifty crore citizens belonging to ten crore families will\nbenefit. We are going to give this benefit to our countrymen. This is a\ntechnology driven system which is transparent. As such, an ordinary citizen\nwill not face any difficulty as technology technological tools have been built\nfor this purpose.\n\nOver the next four, five, six weeks from today, this technology will be tested\nacross the country to make it fool proof. On the 25th of September, the\nbirth anniversary of Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyaya, the Pradhanmantri Jan\nArogya Abhiyan will be launched throughout the country. No poor person of\nthe country will have to face difficulty in dealing with diseases. Nor he\nwould have to borrow money from a moneylender paying interest. His\nfamily will not be destroyed. And it will also open new avenues of\nemployment for the youth, for the middle class families in the health sector.\nNew hospitals will be built in the tier-2 and tier-3 cities. They will require\nmedical staff in large numbers. A lot of employment opportunities will also\nbe generated.\n\nBrothers and sisters, no poor person wants to lead a life of penury. No poor\nperson wants to die poor. No poor person wants to pass on his poverty as\na legacy to his children. Throughout his life, he struggles to come out of\npoverty. There is only one way to end this problem- through the\nempowerment of poor people.\n\nIn the last four years, we have laid emphasis on empowerment of poor\npeople. It has been our endeavour to empower the poor people. An\ninternational organization has released a very good report in the recent\npast. According to the report, five crore poor people in India have crossed\nthe Poverty Line in the last two years.\n\nBrothers and sisters, when we carry out the work for the empowerment of\npoor people; and when I talked about Ayushman Bharat Program, then\nvery few people realized the massive size of the scheme, – 10 crore\nfamilies or a population of 50 crore people, very few people were able to\ngrasp what it means. If I combine the population of America (USA), Canada\nand Mexico, then the number of beneficiaries of Ayushman Bharat Program\nwill be nearly the same. If I take into account the population of entire\nEurope, then nearly the same number of people are going to get the\nbenefits of this Ayushman Bharat scheme in India.\n\nBrothers and sisters, we have formulated several schemes for\nempowerment of the poor. Although many schemes have been formulated\nin the past, middlemen, the people who take cuts, used to take away the\ncream of the scheme. The poor people didn’t get what rightfully belonged to\nthem. Money was being paid from the exchequer, the schemes existed on\npaper, and the country continued to be robbed. The Government cannot\nkeep its eyes shut. And, at least I can never keep my eyes shut to this kind\nof thing.\n\nBrothers and sisters, therefore it is extremely essential to create confidence\nin the minds of the common man by eliminating the deformities in our\nsystem. And whether it is the state governments or the centre or whether\nthese are the local bodies of self-rule, we all have to work together. And we\nwill have to take it forward. You will be surprised to know that since the time\nwe have been engaged in this campaign for cleansing the system, and\nplugging leakages; there were six crore bogus beneficiaries who had never\nbeen born, who never existed on the earth but the money was being sent in\ntheir names - somebody was the beneficiary of Ujjwala Scheme, some\nbeneficiary of the gas connection scheme with a duplicate gas connection;\nsomebody was taking benefits through bogus ration cards; somebody was\nthe beneficiary of scholarship scheme; someone else was the beneficiary\nof pension scheme. How difficult it would have been to remove these six\ncrore names! How many people would have faced problems because of\nthis ! The person who was never born, the person who doesn’t exist\nanywhere on the earth, but the money was pilfered on his name by using\nbogus names.\n\nThis government has put an end to it. We have taken steps in the direction\nof curbing corruption and putting an end to the entire system of black\nmoney.\n\nBrothers and sisters, what are the consequences of it? Rs.90,000 crores is\nnot a small amount. Almost Rs.90,000 crores, which used to go into the\nhands of wrong people for wrong activities, is now in the nation's treasury,\nnow being used for the welfare of common man.\n\nBrothers and sisters, why does it happen? Our country works for the pride\nand honour of the poor people, but what do these middlemen do? You\nmust be aware of the fact that wheat is sold at Rs. 24-25 (per kilo) in the\nmarket, but the government provides it to the poor at only Rs.2 on ration\ncard after buying it at Rs.24-25. Similarly, rice which is sold at Rs.30-32 in\nthe market is purchased by the Government at this rate and provided to the\npoor at Rs.3 on ration cards. This means if anyone steals 1 kg of wheat on\na bogus ration card, he automatically gains Rs.20-25. If gets rice in this\nmanner, he will get Rs 30-35. That's why this entire business of bogus\nnames and IDs had been going on. When a poor person used to approach\nthe shop with his ration card and request grain, the shopkeeper would say\nthat the stock was over. That grain then used to be diverted to another\nshop and the poor had to purchase the grain of Rs.2 from the other shop at\nRs.20-25. The right of the poor used to be snatched away. Therefore, this\nbogus system has now been uprooted.\n\nBrothers and sisters, crores of poor people in our country get food at Rs.2\nand Rs.3. The government is spending generously for the same but the\ncredit does not go to the government. Today I want to specifically tell the\nhonest taxpayers that when you have your food with your family, for a\nmoment kindly ponder over what I am about to say. I want to touch the\nhearts of the honest taxpayers. I want to salute them. I want to reassure the\nhonest taxpayers that all the schemes that are in operation are run by your\nmoney. The honest tax payers gain good fortune because the poor get to\neat from the taxpayers’ money. Therefore, it is the result of your honest\npaying of taxes when you have your meal with your family, 3 poor families\nare also able to have their meals at the same time.\n\nFriends, an atmosphere of non-payment of taxes was being created.\nHowever, when a person, even if he is in an AC room, comes to know that\n3 poor families are being served with his tax money, it is highly satisfying\nfor his soul. This is the most virtuous task for a person. Brothers and\nsisters, today, the country is moving ahead celebrating the festival of\nhonesty. Till 2013, i.e. for the last 70 years, there were 4 crore people who\nwere paying direct taxes. However brothers and sisters, today this figure\nhas increased to almost 6.75 crore. Look how far we have come from 3, 3.5\nor 3.75 crore to 6.75 crore. Are not these glaring figures a true reflection of\nhonesty? This is an example that nation is treading the path of honesty. In\nthe past 70 years, 70 lakh enterprises were included in the Indirect tax net.\nHowever, in the last one year alone, after the introduction of GST, the\nfigure has catapulted to one crore and 16 lakh. Brothers and sisters, today\neveryone in the country is participating in celebrating the festival of\nhonesty. I salute all those who are embracing transparency and honesty. I\nwish to reassure those who want to step forward. You are making a\ncontribution in the nation’s progress. Your problems are our concerns. We\nstand with you, for we have to take the nation forward through everyone’s\ncontribution. Therefore, we will not tolerate black money and corruption.\nCome what may, we shall not retract from the path of honesty, as we all\nhave seen how they have corroded and ruined the nation. Thus, you would\nhave seen that power-brokers are not to be seen in the power corridors of\nDelhi.\n\nDear countrymen, times have changed. Some people sitting in their\ndrawing rooms used to claim that they will change the policies of the\ngovernment, or influence in them in a negative way have been silenced.\nOur doors are closed to them.\n\nDear countrymen, we have rooted out nepotism and affiliations. We have\nstrongly condemned favoritism and bias. Strong action is being taken\nagainst corrupt officers. More than three lakh dubious companies have\nbeen closed down, and restrictions have been imposed on their directors.\nToday, we have introduced IT interventions for online transactions to\nensure transparency. There was a time when seeking an environmental\nclearance meant facing rampant corruption. We have made the process\ntransparent and online. Any person can access it. We can work in a way\nthat the nation’s resources are utilized judiciously. It is also a matter of\nimmense pride for women of the country that today we have three women\njudges in the Supreme Court providing justice to the nation. This is the first\ntime after independence that the Union Cabinet has the maximum\nrepresentation of women ministers.\n\nDear Countrymen, today I wish to share some wonderful news with my\nbrave daughters. On this occasion, I declare with pride the grant of\nPermanent Commission for the appointment of women officers in Short\nService Commission of Indian Armed Forces. The process will be\ntransparent and similar to the selection process of male officers. This is a\ngift from my side from the ramparts of the Red Fort, to the daughters who\nare in uniformed services and have dedicated their lives to the nation. The\nnation salutes the patriotic fervor and national commitment displayed by\nyoung girls who are our national pride. Women are equally contributing in\nbuilding a strong India. The nation is experiencing the pride, contribution\nand potential of our mothers and sisters.\n\nFrom agricultural fields to the sports arena, our women are holding the\nIndian Tricolor high. From Sarpanch to the Parliament, our women are\ncontributing to the development of the country. From schools to armed\nforces everywhere the women of our country are marching ahead. But\nwhile our women are valiantly moving ahead in such large numbers, we\nalso come across gruesome ugliness. We sometimes see demonic forces\nposing challenges to women’s power. Rape is painful, and we, the\ncountrymen, the people should feel many times more pain than the pain\nborne by the victim. Brothers and sisters, we have to free this society from\nthis demonic mentality. The law is taking its own course. Recently, rapists\nin a case from Katni in Madhya Pradesh were sentenced to death after just\nfive days of trial. Similarly, in Rajasthan, rapists were sentenced to death\nafter a few days of trial. More such news gets published, the more such\npeople with demonic mentality will get scared. We have to publicize such\nnews. People should know that rapists are being sent to the gallows. There\nis a need to beat this mentality; there is a need to curb this thinking, and\nthere is a need to stop this aberration. Brothers and sisters, this mentality\nbreeds unpardonable crimes. Rule of law is supreme for us and there\ncannot be any compromise on that. Nobody can be allowed to take law into\ntheir own hands. In the family, in schools, colleges, our children of the new\ngeneration, our small innocent children should be nurtured in such an\nenvironment that they learn appropriate values. They should learn to\nrespect women. They should know that this is the right way to live. We\nhave to instill this feeling and values in our families.\nBrothers and sisters, I want to reassure my Muslim sisters. Triple Talaq has\nspoiled the lives of Muslim daughters of our country. Those who have not\nfaced the Talaq are spending their lives under pressure. We wanted to\nbring a legislation in this session of Parliament itself to free Muslim women\nfrom this evil system. But there are some people who are obstructing the\npassage of this Bill. But I want to assure my Muslim mothers, sisters and\ndaughters that I will not stop till they get justice. I will fulfill your aspirations.\n\nMy beloved countrymen, our army, paramilitary forces, police, intelligence\nagencies are the source of strength for our country’s internal security. They\nhave created a sense of security in us. They have ensured a peaceful\nenvironment. A new confidence has been generated because of their\nsacrifices, dedication and hard work.\n\nBrothers and Sisters, we used to hear about incidents of violence every\nnow and then from the North East, there were reports of insurgency. We\nused to hear about the incidents of bomb blasts and firing. But today the\ntwo states of Meghalaya and Tripura have seen withdrawal of the Armed\nForces Special Power Act (AFSPA) which was in force for three or four\ndecades. This was possible because of efforts of our security forces,\nbecause of actions taken by the state Governments, because of\ndevelopment projects executed by the Centre and the state Governments\nand the efforts to connect people there with the national mainstream.\nTripura and Meghalaya are now out of the purview of the Armed Forces\nSpecial Power Act. Several districts of Arunachal Pradesh have also been\nbrought out of the purview of the Armed Forces Special Power Act. Now, it\nis in force only in a few districts.\n\nLeft Wing Extremism, Maoism have been bleeding the country. Violent\nincidents, people fleeing from homes and hiding in forests were a matter of\ndaily occurrence. However, today because of continuous efforts by our\nsecurity forces, launching of development projects and efforts to connect\nthe people with national mainstream, left-wing extremism which affected\n126 districts has now been reduced to 90 districts. The work on finding a\nsolution to put an end to left wing extremism from those districts is\nprogressing rapidly.\n\nBrothers and Sisters, regarding Jammu & Kashmir, the path shown by Atal\nBihari Vajpayeeji is the right one. We want to move ahead on that road.\nVajpayeeji said Insaniyat, Jamhuriyat, Kashmiriyat (humanism, democracy,\nKasmiriyat)–with these three basic elements we want to develop Jammu &\nKashmir. Whether it is Ladakh or Jammu or Srinagar valley. We want\nbalanced development where an ordinary person’s aspirations are fulfilled,\ninfrastructure is strengthened; we want to move ahead with brotherhood in\nour hearts. We do not want to move on the road of bullets and abuses, we\nwant to move ahead with love and affection with the Kashmiri people who\nhave stood with us in patriotic fervor.\n\nBrothers and Sisters, irrigation schemes are progressing. The work of\nbuilding IIT, IIM and AIIMS is speedily going on. The work of reclamation\nof Dal Lake is also going on. The biggest thing is that during the past one\nyear village headmen from Jammu and Kashmir in large numbers have\nbeen meeting me with the request to hold Panchayat elections there. The\nelections could not be held for some reason or the other. I am happy that\nthe villagers of Jammu and Kashmir will have this opportunity in the coming\nmonths. A system in which villagers will be able to look after their villages\nwill be in place soon. Now, the Government of India gives huge funds\nwhich go directly to the villages and this will help the village headmen to\ntake their villages on the path of development. That is why we are moving\nforward in the direction of holding Panchayat elections and election to City\nCouncils.\n\nBrothers and Sisters, we have to take the country to new heights. Our\nmotto is “Sab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikaas’. There is no discrimination based\non yours or mine and no nepotism. And that is why we are going ahead\nwith this aim and today standing under this tricolour, once again I want to\nreiterate the resolve for which we are ready to sacrifice ourselves.\n\nLet every Indian have a house of his own - Housing for All. Every house\nshould have electricity connection, power for all. Every Indian should be\nfree from smoke in kitchen and that is why there is the scheme for Cooking\nGas for All. Every Indian should have enough water to meet his needs and\nthat is why there is the scheme for Water for All. Every Indian should have\ntoilets and therefore Sanitation for All. Every Indian should be skilled, so\nSkill for All. Every Indian should get good and affordable health services, so\nHealth for All. Every Indian should feel safe, every Indian should be\ninsured, hence ‘Insurance for All’. Every Indian should get internet services\nso, Connectivity for All; we want to take the country forward by following\nthis mantra.\n\nMy dear brothers and sisters, people tell many things about me too and\nwhatever may be said, I would like to publicly admit certain things today. I\nam impatient as several countries have gone ahead of us, I am restless\nand impatient to take my country ahead of all these countries.\n\nMy dear countrymen, I am worked up and I am restless because\nmalnutrition has been a major hurdle in the development of the children of\nour country. It remains a huge bottleneck. I am restless to rid my country of\nmalnutrition.\n\nMy countrymen, I am agitated so that a poor person can get an appropriate\nhealth cover. I am restless so that an ordinary citizen of my country can\ncombat diseases and remain healthy.\n\nBrothers and sisters, I am restless, I am restless to ensure that our citizens\ncan have a quality life, so that they can have the opportunity to live with\nease and so that there may be an all-round improvement.\nMy dear countrymen, I am restless, I am agitated and I am also impatient\nfor my country to lead the fourth industrial revolution, the revolution that is\nbased on knowledge, the revolution which will be led by those who have IT\nskills. I am impatient for my country to lead it.\n\nMy dear countrymen, I am restless because I want that my country should\ntake maximum advantage of its capabilities and resources and we can\nmove forward in the world with a sense of pride.\n\nMy dear countrymen, we want to move ahead. We cannot accept\nstagnation, we cannot be standstill and it is not in our nature to bend before\nanybody. This country will neither come to a standstill, neither will it bend\nand nor will it get tired. We have to achieve greater heights, we have to\nkeep moving ahead.\n\nBrothers and sisters, we are the inheritors of the rich heritage of our ancient\nlegacy of Vedas. And that legacy is due to our self-confidence, and we\nwant to carry forward the legacy.\n\nMy dear countrymen, we don’t want to only dream about the future, but\naspire to scale new heights in the future. We want to move forward with the\ndream of being at the top. And that is why my dear countrymen, I want to\ninstill a new hope, a new zeal and a new belief (in you) because the\ncountry can achieve its dreams with it. And that is why my dear\ncountrymen…\n\nअपने मन म एक ल य लए,\n\nअपने मन म एक ल य लए,\n\nमंिजल अपनी     य    लए,\n\nअपने मन म एक ल य लए,\nमंिजल अपनी       य    लए हम तोड़ रहे है जंजीर,\n\nहम तोड़ रहे ह जंजीर,\n\nहम बदल रहे हत वीर,\n\nये नवयग\n      ु है , ये नवयग\n                   ु है ,\n\nये नवभारत है , ये नवयग\n                     ु है ,\n\nये नवभारत है ।\n\n“खद\n  ु लखगे अपनी तकद र, हम बदल रहे ह त वीर,\n\nखद\n ु लखगे अपनी तकद र, ये नवयग\n                          ु है , नवभारत है ,\n\nहम नकल पड़े ह, हम नकल पड़े ह ण करके,\n\nहम नकल पड़े ह ण करके, अपना तनमन अपण करके,\n\nअपना तनमन अपण करके, िज़द है , िज़द है , िज़द है ,\n\nएक सय\n    ू उगाना है , िज़द है एक सय\n                            ू उगाना है ,\n\nअ बर से ऊंचा जाना है , अ बर से ऊंचा जाना है ,\n\nएक भारत नया बनाना है , एक भारत नया बनाना है ।।”\n\nMy dear brothers and sisters,\n\nOnce again on the sacred occasion of independence, I offer my best\nwishes.

We are\nfortunate to have in our cultural and historical heritage from a Sudarshan\nChakradhari Mohan to Charkhadhari Mohan.\n\nFrom the ramparts of Red Fort, on behalf of our 125 crore countrymen, I\nbow and pay respects to all those men and women who have sacrificed\ntheir lives, who have undergone immense sufferings and made sacrifices\nfor the independence, glory and pride of the country.\n\nSometimes, natural calamities are a big challenge for us. A good monsoon\ncontributes immensely to the prosperity of the country. However, due to\nclimate change, sometimes it turns into a natural calamity.

I assure the countrymen\nthat in this hour of crisis we shall leave no stone unturned to ensure the\nwellbeing of all.\n\nMy dear countrymen, this year is a special year for independent India. We\ncommemorated 75 years of Quit India Movement last week. This year we\nare also commemorating the centenary of Champaran Satyagrah and the\nSabarmati Ashram. The centenary of Lokmanya Tilak’s call “Swaraj is my\nbirth right” falls this year as well. The year marks the 125th Anniversary of\nthe Ganesh Utsav which led to the rise of community awakening through\nthe celebrations. It inspires us to dedicate ourselves to a cause for the\ncountry. A collective resolve of the citizens was visible during 1942 to 1947\nacross the country which forced the British to Quit India within a span of\nfive years. We will have to exhibit the same resolve from now on in the\n70th year of independence to 2022, the 75th year of independence.\n\nWe now have five years before we reach the 75th year of our\nindependence. Our united resolve, strength and determination to work hard\nremembering the memory of our great patriots will help us to build an India\nof their dreams by 2022. Therefore, we have to take the country forward\nwith a pledge to build a New India.\n\nWe are aware of the power of the collective resolve, hard work, sacrifice\nand devotion of our 125 crore citizens. Lord Krishna was immensely\npowerful, but it is only when the milkmen came out with sticks in his support\nthat they could lift the Govardhan parvat. When Lord Rama had to go to\nLanka, the monkeys of vanar sena came to his help, Ramsetu was built\nand Lord Rama could reach Lanka. Then there was Mohandas\nKaramchand Gandhi, who empowered his countrymen to weave the fabric\nof independence with cotton and spinning wheel.\n\nThe collective resolve and strength of the people got freedom for our\ncountry. No one is small or big. We have in our memory the story of squirrel\nwhich became an agent of change. That’s why we must remember that no\none among the 125 crore people is either small or big – everyone is equal.\nIf each one of us, irrespective of where he belongs to, strives with a new\nresolve, a new energy, a new strength, we can change the face of the\ncountry with our combined strength in the 75th year of our independence in\n2022. It will be the New India – a secure, prosperous and strong nation. A\nNew India where there is equal opportunity for all; where modern science\nand technology play an important role in bringing glory for the nation in the\nglobal arena.\n\nOur freedom movement is linked to our sentiments. We know it well that at\nthe time of the freedom movement, the teacher who was engaged in\nteaching, the farmer who was tilling his land, the laborer who was working –\nall of them knew in their hearts that whatever they were doing, was\ncontributing towards the independence of the country. This idea is a great\nsource of strength. In the family, food is prepared everyday but it becomes\n‘prasad’ only when it is offered to the deity.\n\nWe are working, but if we do so in the spirit of working for the glory of\nmother India, for the divinity of mother India, if we do it to rid our\ncountrymen of poverty, if we do it to properly weave our social fabric, if we\ndischarge our duties with feelings towards the country, if we do it with a\nsense of devotion to country, if we do our work by dedicating it to the\ncountry, then the achievements will be much more. That is why we should\nmove forward with this spirit.\n\nJanuary 1, 2018 will not be an ordinary day – those born in this century will\nstart turning 18. For these people, this is a decisive year of their lives. They\nare going to be the creator of the destiny (Bhagya Vidhata) of our nation in\nthe 21​st​ century. I heartily welcome all these youth, honour them and offer\nmy respects to them. You have an opportunity to shape the destiny of our\ncountry. A proud nation invites you to become a part of its developmental\njourney.\n\nMy dear countrymen,\n\nWhen Arjuna was posing a lot of queries to Lord Krishna in the battlefield of\nKurukshetra, then Krishna told Arjuna that you achieve goals as per your\nthinking and beliefs. We have a strong determination, we are committed for\na brighter India. We, who have grown up with a state of hopelessness,\nhave to reject the feeling of despair and must now march ahead with\nconfidence.\n\nWe have to leave this 'Chalta Hai' attitude. We have to think of 'Badal Sakta\nHai'- this attitude will help us as a nation. We should have this confidence\nthat with sacrifice and hard work and a resolve to do something, we will get\nnecessary resources and the ability to do it and then a big transformation\nwill happen, and our resolve will convert into accomplishment.\n\nBrothers and sisters,\n\nIt is natural for our countrymen to think of our safety and security. Our\ncountry, our military, our brave-hearts, our uniformed forces, be it any\nforce, not just the army, air force or navy, all the uniformed forces,\nwhenever they were called upon to do so, they showed their valour, their\nstrength; our brave-hearts never turned their back in making the supreme\nsacrifice. Be it Left-Wing-Extremism, be it terrorism, be it infiltrators, be it\nthe elements fomenting trouble inside our country- the uniformed forces of\nour country have made extreme sacrifices. And when the surgical strike\nwas carried out, then the world had to acknowledge India’s capability and\nstrength.\n\nMy dear countrymen,\n\nIndia's security is our priority. Be it our coast line or our borders, the space\nor the cyberspace, India is capable of ensuring its own security and strong\nenough to ward off any threats against the country.\n\nMy beloved countrymen,\n\nThose who have looted the nation and looted the poor are not able to sleep\npeacefully today. Due to this, the confidence of the hardworking and honest\nperson is increasing. An honest man now feels that his honesty matters.\nToday, we are celebrating a festival of honesty and there is no place for\ndishonesty. This gives us new hope.\n\nThe law against Benami property was lying in limbo for years. Now, we\nhave come up with a law against Benami Property. In such a short time, the\ngovernment has unearthed Benami properties worth over Rs.800 crores.\nWhen these things happen, the common man develops faith that the\ncountry is for the honest persons.\n\nThe 'One Rank - One Pension' policy for our defence forces was stuck up\nfor 30-40 years. Our government implemented it. When we fulfill the\naspirations of our soldiers, then their morale goes high and their resolve to\nprotect the nation grows manifold.\n\nThe country has many states and a Central Government. GST has shown\nthe spirit of cooperative federalism and has given competitive cooperative\nfederalism a new strength. The success of GST can be attributed to the\nhard work that has been put in to make it a success. Technology has made\nit look like a miracle. The global community is surprised how we were able\nto roll out GST in such a short time. It is a reflection of our capability and\nhelps in building the confidence and faith of the future generations.\n\nNew systems are emerging. Today roads are being built at twice the speed.\nThe railway tracks are being laid at double the speed. More than 14\nthousand villages that were hitherto shrouded in darkness even after\nIndependence, have been provided with electricity. Bank accounts of 29\ncrore people have been opened, more than 9 crore farmers have got Soil\nHealth Card. More than 2 crore poor mothers and sisters are no longer\nusing the fuel wood and using LPG gas stove NOW. The poor tribals have\ngained faith in the system. The person at the last mile of development now\njoins the mainstream and the nation is marching ahead.\n\nMore than 8 crore loans have been sanctioned without guarantee to the\nyouth for self-employment. The interest on bank loans have been lowered.\nInflation is under control. If a person belonging to the middle-class wants to\nbuild his house, then he gets a loan at a lower rate of interest. In this way,\nthe country is moving forward and people are joining the movement.\nThe times have changed. The government is determined to do all it says,\nlike doing away with the interview process.\n\nIn the labour sector alone, even a small businessman had to fill up to 50-60\nforms, but we have now made it more convenient by reducing it to just 5-6\nforms. I can provide many such instances of Good Governance, simplifying\nthe process of Governance. By reiterating this we have enforced faster\ndecision making. And that is why 125 crore countrymen have been able to\nrepose faith in our governance.\n\nDear Countrymen,\n\nIndia today has gained in stature across the globe. You will be happy to\nknow that we are not alone in our fight against terrorism. Many nations are\nproactively supporting us.\n\nBe it Hawala, or any inputs related to terrorism, the global community is\nsupporting us with critical information. We have joined hands with other\nnations in the combined fight against terrorism. I extend my heartfelt\ngreetings to all those countries who are standing in solidarity with us and\nacknowledge our prowess.\n\nFor the development and progress of Jammu & Kashmir, its prosperity, and\nfulfilment of the aspirations of the citizens, not only the J&K government,\nbut we as responsible citizens also have a responsibility. We are committed\nto restore the state to its former glory so as to experience the paradise that\nit was, once again.\n\nOn Kashmir there is rhetoric and politics. But I am clear in my belief on how\nto win the war against separatism, which is spread by a handful of people.\nThe problem will be solved neither by abuse or bullets - it will be solved by\nembracing all Kashmiris. Such is the legacy of 125 crore Indians. Hence,\nneither by abuse nor by bullets, change will come by embracing all. And we\nare moving forward with this resolve.\n\nWe shall take strict steps against terrorism. There is no question of being\nsoft on terrorism or terrorists. We have been asking the extremists to join\nthe mainstream. Democracy provides an equal opportunity and rights to be\nheard for all. The process of engagement can take place only by their\njoining the mainstream.\n\nI deeply appreciate the efforts of security forces in curbing the Left Wing\nextremism which mobilized a lot of youth from these regions to surrender\nand joined the mainstream.\n\nSecurity forces are keeping a tight vigil on our borders. I am delighted to\nannounce that today the Indian Government is launching a website which\nwill give an account of the valour of the Gallantry Award winners. A portal\nis also being launched which aims to provide the entire details of these\nbrave hearts who have brought pride to the nation. The story of sacrifices\nmade will certainly inspire the younger generations.\n\nWith the help of technology, we are trying to promote honesty and\ntransparency in the country. Our fight against black money will continue;\nour fight against corruption will continue. With the intervention of\ntechnology, slowly we are trying to link Aadhaar with the system. We have\nbeen successful in infusing transparency in the system. People from\naround the world have appreciated this model and have been studying it.\n\nA common man living thousands of kilometres away can now supply his\nproducts to the Government. He doesn’t need any middle man. We have\nlaunched a portal called “GEM”. The Government is making procurement\nthrough this portal. We have been successful in bringing transparency at\nvarious levels.\nBrothers and Sisters,\n\nImplementation of Government schemes are gaining momentum. When a\nwork is delayed, it is not only the project that is delayed. It is not a matter of\nexpenditure of money. When a work is stalled, the poor families are the\nones who suffer the most.\n\nWe can reach the planet Mars within 9 months; we are capable of\nachieving that.\n\nI review Government Projects every month. A specific project came to my\nnotice. It was a 42-year old project. 70-72 kilometres of Railway lines were\nto be laid, but the project was lying in limbo for the last 42 years.\n\nMy brothers and sisters,\n\nWhen a country that is capable of reaching Mars within 9 months, how is it\npossible that it is not able to lay 70-72 Kilometres railway lines for 42 long\nyears. It sets in doubts in the minds of the poor. We have taken care of all\nthese things. We have been striving to bring in the changes through\ntechnology. Whether it is Geo-Technology or Space-Technology, we have\ntried to link all these technologies to bring in transformation.\n\nYou must have seen that there was a time when tension prevailed between\nthe Centre and the States for Urea and Kerosene. The Centre was like an\nelder brother while the State was treated like a younger brother. I have\nbeen a Chief Minister for a long time and I know the importance of states in\nthe development of the country. I know the importance of the Chief\nMinisters and the State Governments. Hence , we laid emphasis on\nCo-operative Federalism. Now we are moving towards a Competitive\nCo-operative Federalism. You must have seen that we are taking all the\ndecisions together.\nYou may recall that one of our Prime Ministers in his address from the\nramparts of Red Fort had talked about the poor state of affairs of the power\nsupply companies of the country. He expressed his concerns over the\nissue. Today with the “UDAY” Yojana, we have worked together to resolve\nthe issues with these power companies. It is a concrete example of\nfederalism in its real sense.\n\nWhether it is GST or Smart City Project, whether it is Swachh Bharat\nAbhiyan, or construction of toilets, or ease of doing business, all these are\nbeing accomplished by working together shoulder to shoulder with the\nStates.\n\nMy dear fellow countrymen,\n\nIn the New India, the biggest strength is democracy. But we have reduced\nour democracy to mere ballot boxes. However, democracy cannot be\nconfined only to ballot boxes. Hence our resolve is to see to it that we have\na democracy in New India, where people are not driven by the system,\nrather the system is driven by the people. Such a democracy should\nbecome the identity of New India and we want to move towards that\ndirection.\n\nLokmanya Tilak Ji had said “Swaraj is my birthright”. In Independent India\nour Mantra should be “Good Governance is my birthright”. ‘Suraja’ or Good\nGovernance should be our collective responsibility. The citizens should\nfulfil their duties and the Government too should discharge its\nresponsibilities.\n\nWhen we move from “Swaraj” to “Suraja”, the citizens do not lag behind.\nFor example, when I called upon the countrymen to give up gas subsidy,\nthe nation responded as a whole. I have spoken about cleanliness. Now\npeople are joining hands from every part of the country to take up this\ncleanliness drive forward.\n\nWhen demonetization was announced, the world was surprised. People\nthought that this was the end of Modi. But the way our 125 crore\ncountrymen had shown patience and faith, we were able to take one after\nanother step in our drive against corruption.\n\nWith this new practice of people’s participation, our effort to take the\ncountry forward with people’s involvement will help us to reach our goal.\n\nMy dear fellow countrymen,\n\nLal Bahadur Shastri had given the slogan “Jai Jawan Jai Kisan.” Our\nfarmers have not looked back since then. They are now producing record\nharvests and scaling new heights despite facing natural adversities. There\nhas been a record production of pulses this year.\n\nMy dear brothers and sisters,\n\nIndia never had the tradition to import pulses and if it had to import on rare\noccasions, it was only a few thousand tons. This year when they produced\n16 lakh tons of pulses to provide nutrition to the poor, the government took\nthe historic step of encouraging them by buying their produce.\n\nPradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojna has provided a security cover to our\nfarmers. Three years back, this scheme which was running under a\ndifferent name earlier, covered only 3.25 crore farmers. Now over a short\nspan of three years more farmers have been brought under its ambit. The\nnumber is soon going to touch the 5.75 crore mark.\n\nPradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojna aims to meet the demand of water of\nthe farmers. If my farmers get water, they can produce rich harvests from\ntheir fields. That is why I had made some announcements from the\nramparts of Red Fort on the last Independence Day. Out of those, we have\ncompleted 21 projects and remaining 50 would be completed soon. I have\nresolved to complete 99 big projects. By completing those 99 big projects\nbefore 2019, we shall fulfill our commitment. We cannot change the lot of\nour farmers until we hand hold him from procuring seeds to ensure that his\nproduce reaches the market. For this we need infrastructure and supply\nchain. Every year vegetables, fruits and grains worth lakhs of crores of\nrupees are wasted. In order to change the situation, the government has\nencouraged Foreign Direct Investment in food processing sector.\n\nGovernment of India has launched ‘Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojna’\nto encourage infrastructure building. Due to this, systems shall be put in\nplace that will ensure hand-holding of the farmers from supplying seeds to\nmarketing his produce. Such arrangements will usher in a new change in\nthe lives of crores of our farmers.\n\nWith the changes in demand and technology, the nature of jobs in our\ncountry has been changing. The Government has launched several new\ninitiatives in the employment related schemes and also in the manner in\nwhich the training is imparted for the development of human resource\naccording to the needs of the 21​st​ century. We have launched a massive\nprogram to provide collateral free loans to the youth. Our youth should\nbecome independent, he should get the employment, he should become\nthe provider of employment. Over the past three years, ‘Pradhanmantri\nMudra Yojana’ has led to millions and millions of youth becoming\nself-dependent. It’s not just that, one youth is providing employment to one,\ntwo or three more people.\n\nIn the education sector, we have taken an important step to grant the\nuniversities freedom from restrictions to make them the world class\nuniversities. We have asked 20 universities to decide their own destiny.\nThe government will not interfere in their functioning. Besides, the\ngovernment is willing to provide funds up to Rs. 1,000 crores. We have\nappealed to them and I am confident that the education institutions of our\ncountry will certainly come forward and make it a success.\n\nOver the last three years, we have set up 6 IITs, 7 new IIMs and 8 new\nIIITs and we have also done the groundwork for linking the education with\njob opportunities.\n\nMy mothers and sisters, the women in the families seek employment in\nlarge numbers. And therefore we have taken a very important step to\nreform the labour laws to provide them the employment opportunities in the\nnight also.\n\nOur mothers and sisters are an integral unit of our families. Their\ncontribution in making our future is extremely important. And that is why we\nhave decided to increase the paid maternity leave to 26 weeks from the\nearlier 12 weeks.\n\nIn the context of women empowerment, I’d like to honour those sisters who\nhave been forced to lead a very difficult life due to ‘Triple Talaq’. There is\nno recourse for them, and such victims of ‘Triple Talaq’ have launched a\nmassive movement in the country. They shook the conscience of the\nintellectual class of the country, the media of the country also helped them\nand a movement against ‘Triple Talaq’ was started in the country. I heartily\ncommend those sisters who have launched this movement, who have been\nfighting against the ‘Triple Talaq’ and I’m confident that the country will help\nthem in this struggle. The country will help these mothers and sisters in\nsecuring this right. India will fully support them and they will ultimately\nachieve success in this very important step in the direction of women\nempowerment; I am fully confident about this.\n\nMy dear countrymen,\nSometimes in the name of faith, some people due to lack of patience end\nup destroying the social fabric. The country is governed by peace, harmony\nand unity. The poison of casteism and communalism can never benefit the\ncountry. This is the land of Gandhi and Buddha, we have to move forward\ntaking everyone along. This is a part of our country’s culture and tradition.\nWe have to successfully carry it forward, and that is why in the name of\nfaith, violence cannot be allowed.\n\nIf something happens to a patient in a hospital and the hospital is burnt\ndown; some accident happens and the vehicles are burnt down; people\nlaunch a movement and the public property is burnt down; is it for a free\nIndia? It is the property of 125 crore Indians. Whose cultural legacy is this?\nThis is our cultural legacy, the legacy of 125 crore people. Whose faith is\nthis? This is our faith, the faith of 125 crore people; and that is why the path\nof violence in the name of faith can never succeed in this country. The\ncountry will never accept this. And that is why I’d like to appeal to all the\ncountrymen that at that time our motto was ‘Bharat Chodo’ and today’s\nslogan is ‘Bharat Jodo’. We have to take everyone and every section of the\nsociety along to take the country forward.\n\nIn order to build a prosperous India, we need a strong economy, balanced\ndevelopment and next generation infrastructure. Only then, we can realise\nthe India of our dreams.\n\nBrothers and sisters,\n\nWe have taken innumerable decisions over the past three years. Some\nhave been noticed, while the rest may not have been noticed. But one thing\nis important - when you move towards big changes, you will face hurdles.\nBut look at the working style of this government; when a train crosses a\nrailway station and changes the track, the speed needs to be reduced from\n60 to 30. The speed of the train decreases while changing the track. We\nare trying to put the whole country on a new track without decreasing the\nspeed. We have maintained the speed.\n\nWe may have brought a number of new laws and systems such as the\nGST, but we have successfully accomplished the task and the work goes\non.\n\nWe have laid emphasis on infrastructure. We have invested lot of funds for\nbuilding the infrastructure – from modernization of the railway station in a\nsmall town, to build an Airport, to expand water-ways or roadways, to form\na gas-grid or a water-grid or to lay down an optical fibre network. We are\nemphasising on all types of modern infrastructure.\n\nMy dear countrymen,\n\nThe prosperity of Eastern India is required for India’s forward movement\ninto the 21st century. It has tremendous potential, rich human resources,\nimmense natural wealth, work force and it has the power to change lives.\nWe are devoting significant attention to eastern India- Bihar, Assam, West\nBengal, Odisha, and the Northeast. These parts have to grow further.\nThese are abundant in natural resources and are striving hard to take the\ncountry to new heights.\n\nBrothers and sisters,\n\nMaking India corruption-free is an important task and we are trying to\nprovide impetus to it. After forming the government, our first task was to\nconstitute an SIT. Today, after three years, I want to tell the countrymen\nproudly that we have unearthed black money worth Rs. 1.25 lakh crores,\nthe culprits would be brought to book and forced to surrender.\n\nDemonetization followed this move. We have achieved several milestones\nthrough demonetization. The hidden black money has been brought into\nthe formal economy. You must have seen that we used to extend the days\nfrom 7 days to 10 days to 15 days; sometimes we allowed the old notes at\nthe petrol pump, at the chemist shops, and sometimes at the railway\nstations, because our intention was to bring all money into the formal\nbanking system and we achieved success in completing the task.\nAccording to the research conducted by outside experts, about Rs.3 lakh\ncrores that had never come into the banking system before, has been\nbrought into the system after the demonetization.\n\nMore than Rs. 1.75 lakh crores deposited in the banks is under the\nscanner. Black money worth Rs. 2 lakh crore had to be deposited in the\nbanks and this system has forced them to be accountable. It has also\nstopped the flow of black money. The number of new taxpayers filing\nincome tax returns from April 01 to August 05 is 56 lakhs while in the same\nperiod last year only 22 lakh filed the returns.. In a way it has more than\ndoubled. This is the result of our fight against black money.\n\nOver 18 lakh people have been identified, whose income is much higher\nthan what their declared income and therefore they have to clarify this.\nAround 4.5 lakh people have now come forward and are trying to trade the\nright path after accepting their mistakes. One lakh people, who had neither\nheard of Income Tax nor paid Income Tax, have now been forced to do so.\n\nBrothers and sisters,\n\nIn our country, we tend to indulge in endless debates and discussions\nfollowing the shutdown of companies. People start speculating about\neconomic meltdown and what not.\n\nYou will be surprised to know that black marketers used to own shell\ncompanies. Post demonetization, the reports from data mining\nastonishingly revealed that there are 3 lakh shell companies dealing in\nHawala transactions. Can anyone imagine? Out of these 3 lakh shell\ncompanies, registration of 1.75 lakh companies were cancelled.\n\nEven if five companies shut shop in India, there is huge public outcry. And\nhere, we have closed one lakh Seventy five thousand companies. The\nlooters of nation’s wealth will have to answer. We have accomplished this\ntask.\n\nYou will be surprised to know that there are some shell companies\noperating from a single address. As many as 400 companies have been\nfound to be operating from one address. There was no one to question\nthem. There was a total collusion.\n\nTherefore, Brothers and sisters, I have waged a big war against corruption\nand black money. We are fighting corruption - for the bright future of India\nand the wellbeing of our people.\n\nBrothers and sisters,\n\nWe have taken several steps and I am sure that post GST, it will increase\nfurther and bring in transparency. Today a truck driver on an average is\nable to save 30% of his travel time from one point to another after GST was\nintroduced. Hundreds of crores of rupees have been saved due to removal\nof check posts. This amounts to 30% increase in his efficiency. Can you\nimagine what it means to accomplish 30% more efficiency in the Indian\ntransportation sector? GST has brought this revolutionary change.\n\nMy dear countrymen,\n\nToday due to demonetization, banks have enough liquidity. Banks are\nreducing their interest rates. Even a common man is able to access inflow\nof funds through Mudra. He is getting opportunities to stand on his feet.\nThe middle class and the underprivileged who aspire to have their own\nhomes someday, are getting loans from the banks at low interest rates.\nSuch moves are giving a fillip to the economic growth of the country.\n\nMy dear countrymen,\n\nTime has changed. We are in the 21st Century. Our country boasts of the\nworld’s largest youth population.\n\nIndia is known in the world for its prowess in IT and Digital World. Should\nwe still remain in the old mind-set? There was a time when leather coins\nwere in vogue, but gradually they ceased to exist. Today we have\npaper-currency. Slowly this paper-currency will be replaced by the digital\ncurrency. We should lead from the front to make a move towards Digital\ntransactions. We should adopt BHIM App for transactions and make it a\npart of our economic activities. We should also work through prepaid\nsystems. I am happy that there has been an increase in Digital\ntransactions. It has increased by 34% compared to last year while the\nprepaid transactions have gone up by 44%. We should move towards a\nless-cash economy.\n\nMy Dear Countrymen, some schemes of the Government are meant for\nensuring savings for the common man. If you use LED bulbs, you can save\nRs.2000 to Rs. 5000 per year. If we succeed in Swachh Bharat, poor will\nbe able to save Rs. 7000 on medicines that they would otherwise have\nspent. Curbing inflation has helped people in saving money in a way.\n\nCheap medicines through Jan Aushadhi Kendras are a boon to the poor.\nThere used to be a lot of expenditure on operations and stents. We are\nstriving to make it possible for knee operations as well. We are striving to\nminimize this expenditure for the poor and the middle class.\n\nEarlier there used to be Dialysis only at the State capitals. Now we have\ndecided to open Dialysis Centres at district level. We have already opened\nthis facility in 350 to 400 districts where free Dialysis services are available\nfor the poor.\n\nWe can take pride in the fact that we have developed various systems to\nshowcase to the world. We have been able to develop the ‘NAVIC\nNavigation System’ through GPS. We have helped the neighbouring\ncountries by successfully launching SAARC Satellite.\n\nWe asserted our supremacy in the world by introducing Tejas aircraft.\nBHIM Aadhaar App for digital transaction has come as a surprise to the\nworld. Crores of RuPay Cards are now available in the country. When all\nthe cards will be operational, it will be the largest number of cards in the\nworld.\n\nMy dear countrymen, I shall urge you to take up the New India Pledge and\nmove ahead. Our scriptures say, “अ नयत काल:, अ नयत कालः भु यो\n वपलव ते, भु यो वपलव ते”. It implies that, if we don’t accomplish a work\nwithin the stipulated time then we shall not be able to get the desired\nresults. So for the ‘Team India’, for the 125 crore countrymen, we have to\ntake the pledge to achieve the goal by 2022.\n\nWe will do it with dedication to see a great, majestic India by 2022.\nSo we will together build such an India where the poor will have Pucca\nHouse with electricity and water.\n\nTogether we will build such an India where the farmers can sleep without\nworry. They will earn double by 2022 of what they are earning today.\nTogether we will build such an India where the youth, the women will have\nenough opportunities to fulfil their dreams.\n\nTogether we will build such an India which will be free from terrorism,\ncommunalism and casteism.\nTogether we will build such an India where nobody will compromise with\ncorruption and nepotism.\n\nTogether we will build such an India which will be clean and healthy, and\nwhere the dream of Su-Raj will be fulfilled.\n\nAnd that is why my dear fellow countrymen, we will together strive to move\nahead in this march towards development.\n\nLet all of us march together with the dream of a building an India of\ngrandeur and majesty as we wait for the 75th year of independence after\ncompleting 70 years of Independence in the next five years.\n\nWith this thought in mind I once again bow my head before the heroes of\nour freedom movement. I bow my head before the new confidence and\npassion of my 125 crore countrymen and I call upon Team India to march\non with this new pledge.\n\nWith this thought I convey my hearty congratulations to all of you.\n\nBharat Mata Ki Jai, Vande Matram, Jai Hind\n\nJai Hind, Jai Hind, Jai Hind, Jai Hind\n\nBharat Mata Ki Jai, Bharat Mata Ki Jai, Bharat Mata Ki Jai,\n\nVande Matram, Vande Matram, Vande Matram, Vande Matram,\n\nThanking you all."},{"year":2016,"pm":"Narendra Modi","party":"BJP","footnote":"Text of the english rendering of PM Shri Narendra Modi’s address to the Nation from the ramparts of the Red Fort on the 70th Independence Day","source":"Press Information Bureau","url":"https://pib.gov.in/","text":"My beloved countrymen, on this auspicious occasion of our festival of\nfreedom; I extend lots of greetings to the one hundred and twenty five\ncrores fellow nationals and also to entire Indian diaspora spread all over\nthe world, from this rampart of the Red Fort. This festival of our freedom,\nthis 70 years of our Independence, is the festival for our resolution to take\nthe nation to new heights with a new resolve and a new fervour and new\nenergy. We are able to breathe in a free air as the result of the sacrifices,\nrenunciation and penance of our millions of great forefathers. We are also\nreminded of the youths who kissed the gallows. We also remember\nMahatma Gandhi, Sardar Patel, Pandit Nehru and countless great persons,\nwho fought ceaselessly for the freedom of our nation. It is the result of their\nstruggles that we are now fortunate enough to breathe as a free citizen.\nIndia is a very ancient nation. We have a history of thousands of years and\nour cultural heritage is also millennia old. Right from the Vedas to\nVivekananda, from the Upanishads to the satellites, the Sudarshan\nChakradhari Mohan to Charkhadhari Mohan, from the Bhim of Mahabharat\nto the Bhimrao; we have a long historical journey and heritage. Our land\nhas seen many historical ups and downs and our generations have waged\nmany struggles and observed penance to bequeath great values to the\nhumanity. India's age is not just seventy years. But having won freedom\nafter a period of subjugation; we have made efforts to take the nation\nforward in this journey of seventy years. Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel united\nthe nation. Now, it is the responsibility of all of us to make this nation better.\nWe all have to work ceaselessly for the realization of the dream of ' One\nIndia, great India'. (Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat).\n\nBrothers and Sisters, We have not attained freedom for free of cost.\nInnumerable were the atrocities, but undeterred were our resolves also.\nEvery Indian was a soldier in the battle for freedom. Each one of them\ndreamt of an independent India. May be every one of them was not\nfortunate enough to sacrifice, may be each of them was not fortunate\nenough to go to prison; but every Indian had a resolve and the leadership\nof Mahatma ji and also the inspiration of countless revolutionaries who had\nsacrificed every thing. All these movements contributed to our attainment of\nIndependence. But, now we have to convert this freedom into 'the real\nfreedom'. Now, this is the resolve of the one hundred and twenty five crores\nof Indians. So, just as we did not attain our freedom without sacrifices; we\nwould not be able to attain ' the real freedom' without renunciation, without\nhuman endeavour (Purusharth), without bravery, without dedication and\ndiscipline. So, in order to take ahead this resolution of one hundred and\ntwenty five crore Indians; all of us will have to move ahead with our specific\nresponsibilities in a most committed manner. Be it a Panchayat or the\nParliament, be it a village headman or the Prime minister; every one of us\nas well as every democratic institution will have to shoulder their\nresponsibilities completely and perfectly. Only then we will be able to\nrealize the dream of our the real freedom as soon as possible.This is\ncorrect to say that our nation is beset with many problems now- a- days.\nBut, we should never forget that if we have the problems, then we also\nhave all the capacities to solve them. So, if we move ahead with all our\ncapabilities, we will find the ways and mean to solve all these problems.\nSo, brothers and Sisters, if we have lakhs of problems, then we also have\none hundred and twenty five crore brains also which are all capable to\nsolve these problems.\n\nDear Brothers & Sisters, there was a time when Government used to be\nsurrounded by aspersions. But now time has changed. At present, no\naspersions are being leveled on the Government. Rather, people have\ngreat expectations from it. When the Government is engulfed in\nexpectations then it signifies hope and trust, which in turn generates those\nexpectations. Expectations give pace towards good governance,\ninvigorates and so the pledges are implemented ad continuum. My\nBrothers & Sisters, today when I am addressing you from the rampart of\nthe Red Fort, it is, therefore, but natural that we should discuss the journey\nof good governance, the work done by the Government and work being\ndone and should be done for the country. I can present before you a very\ndetailed account of work done and also multiple issues regarding the\nperformance of the Government. During the tenure of two years, the\nGovernment has taken innumerable initiatives and multiple tasks have\nbeen done. If I start giving details about them, I am afraid I will have to talk\nabout it for a week from this very rampart of the Red Fort. So instead of\nthat temptation, I would like to draw your attention towards the work culture\nof the Government. Sometimes, it is easier to present the account of work\ndone. But, it is not easy for a common man to comprehend, understand\nand identify the work culture without dwelling deep into the work culture. My\nBrothers & Sisters, My Countrymen, I would not talk solely about the policy,\nbut also the intention and decisions of the Government.\n\nDear Brothers & Sisters, it is just not an issue of direction and outline,\nrather it is about holistic approach and a resolve for transformation. It is\nconfluence of trinity of expectation of people, democracy and support of\npeople. It is both wisdom and consent. It is also pace and realisation of\nprogress. Therefore, My Countrymen, when I talk about the Good\nGovernance, it does implies bringing in transformation in the life of common\nman of my country. Good governance means that the government should\nbe sensitive, responsive and dedicated to the common man. Then only\ngood governance gets the emphasis. Responsibility and accountability\nshould be at the root of it and it should draw its vital energy from there only\nfor the government to be sensitive, dear Brothers and Sisters. We\nremember the days when there used to be a very long wait to go to any big\nhospital. People used to come to AIIMS, spend two three days and then\nonly it would be decided what diagnostic tests were to be done. Now we\nhave been able to change this system. Registration is done online and the\ndoctor’s appointment is also given online. The processes start on arrival of\nthe patient at the appointed hour itself. Not only this but all his medical\nrecords are also available online. And we wish to develop it as a\ncountywide culture in the field of medical treatment. Today this system has\nbeen put in place in 40 big hospitals of the country. Its basic premise is that\nthe government has to be sensitive.\nDear Brothers and Sisters, the government should be accountable. If it be\nnot so then the problems of the common man are kept pending for\nsolutions. How does the change come? Now technology is there, but there\nwas a time when the railway ticket in the railways, concerning the common\nman and the poor was available only two thousand tickets per minute.\nThose who might have seen it, would know how the buffering used to be\nthere, nobody knew when the website would be operational again, but\ntoday I have to say with satisfaction that now it is possible to have fifteen\nthousand tickets per minute.The government should be accountable, it\nshould take steps according to the necessities and expectations of the\npeople. There is a class across the country, particularly the middle class,\nhigher middle class whom you see troubled more at the hands of the\nincome tax officials rather than the police at times. I have to change the\nsituation and I am trying and I will certainly change it.\n\nThere was a time when a common and honest citizen used to give two\nrupees extra as a measure of caution at the time of paying his income tax.\nHe used to think that he might not be harassed, but once the money was\ndeposited to the government exchequer, he had to run from pillar to post\nand seek recommendations for getting the refund. It took months together\nbefore the rightful money of the citizen was returned to him from the\ngovernment exchequer. Today, we have made a system of issuing online\nrefund. Today, refunds are given in one, two say or three weeks. Those\nwho are hearing me today on TV, they would also be realising that they had\nnot given any application, yet they had got refund directly into their account.\nSo, this responsibility and accountability are the results of these efforts.\n\nIt is equally important to lay emphasis on the transparency for good\ngovernance. You know that a global relationship has already started to\nbecome a common thing in the society today. A middle class man wants to\nhave his passport- there was a time when about 40 lakh, 50lakh\napplications were received for getting passport. Today, approximately 2\ncrore people apply for the passport. Brothers and Sisters, earlier 4-6\nmonths were taken for scrutiny of applications if one did not have\nrecommendations. We changed that situation and today, I can say with\npride that passports are issued to the citizens with all genuine details, in\nabout one or two weeks and there is transparency no recommendation is\nrequired and there is no dilly-dallying. Today, I can say, we have issued\n1.75 crores passports (in 2015-16 itself.)\n\nIn Surajya there must be efficiency in governance and therefore, earlier, if a\ncompany had to set up a factory or desiring to do business in our country,\napplications were submitted. There was a task of registration only, one\nwanted to do something for the country, but almost 6 months passed in\nnormal course. Brothers and Sisters, if efficiency is brought, then the same\ngovernment, same rules, same officials have got geared up to perform the\nsame task of company registration within 24 hours and they are virtually\ndoing it. In the last July itself, they performed the task of more than 900\nsuch registrations.\n\nBrothers and Sisters, good governance is also necessary for Surajya and\nthe steps we have taken towards this good governance are that, as I had\nsaid last year from the Red Fort that we would exempt group 'C' and group\n'D' posts from interviews, they might get job on the basis of merit. We have\ndetected almost 9,000 posts for which thousands and lakhs of people need\nto be recruited. Now, there would not be any interview process for these\n9,000 posts, my young men would not need to spend any money for\ninterviews. Recommendations would not be needed, roads for corruption\nand agents will be shut and this work has been implemented.\n\nBrothers and Sisters, there was a time when a common man got satisfied if\nthe government announced any plan or merely announced that this would\nbe done, he used to think that something concrete would happen now.\nThen, a time came when people asked for the plan unless the drawing of\nthe plan came. Then, there was a time when people asked for the budget.\nToday, the mood of the country has changed in 70 years. It does not get\nsatisfied with the announcement, it is not satisfied by seeing the plan, if a\nbudget provision is made, it is not ready to accept this. It is accepted when\nthings get implemented on ground and we cannot bring things on ground\nwith the old pace. We have to speed up our work, increase the pace further\nand then we can say that we have done something.\n\nRural roads are a perpetual issue in our country. Each rural citizen craves\nfor pakka roads. Its a huge task. Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ji took this task\nspecifically. Even succeding governments continued this and the work\ncontinued. We have made efforts to fast track it. Earlier 70-75 Km of rural\nroads were completed in a day. Now we have increased that pace up to\n100KM a day. This pace will fulfil the aspirations of common man in the\ndays to come.\n\nWe have aid emphasis on energy, specifically renewable energy in our\ncountry. That was a time, when after so many years of independence, we\nstarted working on wind energy. Within a period of last one year we have\nincreased it up to 40%. So this is the scale of up acceleration. Whole world\nis focussing on Solar energy. We have increased it approximately\n116%-118%. This is not only a substantial incremental change, it’s a huge\nleap forward. We intend to enhance the things in quantum way.\n\nIn our country, even before forming of our government, we had the power\nproduction. But to reach the power, you need transmission lines and the\ngood transmission infrastructure. Two years preceding the formation of our\ngovernment, 30-35 thousand kilometres of transmission lines were being\nlaid annually. Today I wish to submit this with satisfaction that we have\nraised this to 50,000 Kilometres. So we have increased the pace here. If\nwe take the commissioning of railway lines in previous 10 years, where\ncommissioning means capacity to ply the trains and to finish all the trials,\nso earlier it was at the rate of 1500 kilometre in 10 years . But we have\nmade it up to 3500 kilometre in last 2 years. We are to increase this pace\neven further.\nBrothers and Sisters, Now we are connecting government schemes to\nAAadhaar Card, focussing on stopping the leakages through direct benefit\ntransfer. Previous government had connected four crore people to\ngovernment schemes via Aadhaar Card. Today I can say this with\nsatisfaction that in place of that work of four crore, we have completed the\ntask of connecting 70 crore people to government schemes via Aadhaar\ncard. The remaining will also be taken into the fold.\n\nToday, for middle class or for common people the ownership of a car is a\nmatter of pride. There was a time when gas stove at home was deemed as\na standard and as a symbol of social status. During the last 60 years of\nindependence, 14 crore LPG gas connections were given. Brothers and\nSisters, it is a great satisfaction to me that on one side, 14 crore gas\nconnections were given in 60 years, while on the other side, we have given\n4 crore gas connections in just 60 weeks. Please compare the two figures -\n14 crore in 60 years and 4 crore in 60 weeks. This is the speed, by which a\nchange has become possible in the quality of life of common men. We\nhave also started the task of eradicating obsolete laws. The burden of\nunnecessary laws has been creating hindrance in the functioning of the\ngovernment, the judiciary and the public. We have identified 1700 such\nlaws, out of which 1175 laws have already been repealed by the Parliament\nand several other such laws are in the process of repealing.\n\nBrothers and Sisters, it had become a tendency among the people to say\nthat certain work can be done and certain other work cannot be done,\ncertain work cannot be done now and certain work cannot be done ever. A\nkind of negativity was prevalent in the minds of people. Now, a clear break\nthrough is visible in the mindset, a new synergy is seen in the functioning of\nthe government. When an accomplishment is achieved, it stimulates\ndynamism, which sharpens our determination and then, the end result is\nnot far away.\nBrothers and Sisters, when we had launched \"Prime Minister Jan-Dhan\nYojana\", it was almost an impossible task. There were banks and the\ngovernments, nationalisation had already taken place, but the common\nman of the country was not able to be a part of the mainstream of national\neconomy.\n\nBrothers and Sisters, we have attained this impossible task through\ninclusion of 21 crore persons under \"Jan-Dhan Yojana\". This is not a matter\nof taking credit by the Government, it is really an achievement of 125 crore\ncountrymen of the country, for which I salute them. The campaign for\nwomen pride in villages of the country is an important issue of today. The\npractice of open defecation should be stopped; toilets should be built in\nvillages. When I had got the first opportunity to address from the ramparts\nof the Red Fort, I had expressed my feelings about it. Now, I can claim that\nmore than 2 crore toilets have already been built in villages of the country\nwithin such a short period. More than 70 thousand villages are now free\nfrom the practice of open defecation. We are working towards bringing\nchange in the lives of common man.\n\nI had earlier announced from the ramparts of the Red Fort that we would\nelectrify those 18 thousand villages, which are still without electricity.We\nare going to complete 70 years of independence, but they had not seen\nelectricity. They were forced to live in the 18th century. We undertook this\ntask of making possible the impossible and today I am glad to say that,\nthough we have not been able to complete even half the task within a\nthousand days, we are still away from the half-mark, out of the 18\nthousand, electricity has reached ten thousand villages. I have been told\nthat there are many among those villages who are watching Independence\nDay celebrations for the first time today on television in their homes. Today,\nfrom here I extend special greetings to those villages.\n\nBrothers and Sisters, you will be surprised to know that at merely three\nhours journey from Delhi, there is a village called Nagla Fatela in Hathras\nregion. It takes only three hours to reach this Nagla Fatela. But it took 70\nyears for electricity to reach there. 70 years, my brothers and Sisters! And\ntherefore, I am introducing you to the work culture that we are following.\n\nBrothers and Sisters, the LED bulbs were developed by the science and\nthe researchers for welfare of every citizen. But in India it used to cost 350\nRupees. Who would buy it? And even the government would think, “It’s\nalright. The work is done. Someone must be using it.” But this should not\nbe the attitude. If LED bulbs can bring about a change in the life of a\ncommon man, if it can ameliorate the environment, if it can improve India’s\neconomy, then the government must make efforts in this direction. It is the\nnature of the government that it intervenes where it is not required and\nshies away from intervening where it is needed. We tried to change this\nsituation, this work culture. And therefore, the bulb which used to be sold at\n350 Rupees, it is now being sold at 50 Rupees because of governmental\nintervention. See the difference! 350 Rupees on one hand and 50 Rupees\non the other. I do not want to ask where all this money used to go,\nhowever, thirteen crore bulbs have been distributed till date.\n\nThe politics of our country has become populist; the economic policies\nhave become populist. If three hundred Rupees subsidy for each bulb had\nbeen given from public exchequer, the Prime Minister would have been\napplauded for doling out five hundred crore to the people. But we have\nensured that they save thousands of crores by providing bulbs at only fifty\nRupees. We have already distributed thirteen crore bulbs and we have\nresolved to distribute 77 crores and I would like to appeal to my\ncountrymen to use LED bulbs in their homes and save 200, 300, 500\nRupees in a year and save energy and save our environment. The day we\nachieve the target of 77 crore bulbs, we would be saving 20 thousand\nMega Watt of electricity. When we save 20000 Megawatt electricity, it\nmeans we save around 125000 crores rupees. Brothers and Sisters, you\ncan save 125000 crore rupees of the country by using a LED bulb at your\nhome. We can fight against global warming by saving 20000 Megawatt\nelectricity and contribute a lot towards the efforts aimed at the protection of\nenvironment and a common man can also contribute to it. So, brothers and\nSisters, we have worked in that direction-making the impossible possible.\n\nYou know that we depend on other countries of the world for energy and\npetroleum products and for that we have signed long term agreements with\nthem so that we could get these products at fixed prices for a long period.\nWe have entered into an agreement with Qatar for buying gas till 2024 but\nthe prices are so high that it is costly for our economy. It was a result of our\nforeign policy relationship that we were able to renegotiate with Qatar, and\nthe agreement which was the right of Qatar, and we were bound to buy gas\nfrom it till 2024, we negotiated with them and today, I can say with\nsatisfaction that we made an impossible task possible, they renegotiated\ntheir prices and it will save 2000 crore rupees of the exchequer of India.\nThey were entitled to get these 20000 crore rupees but the nature of\nrelationship that we have with them and our policies have made it possible.\nThe negotiations have been going on during the tenure of all the\nGovernments and efforts were also made for Chabahar Port, which is an\nimportant link for connecting us with Central Asia, but today I feel satisfied\nto see an impossible task becoming possible. When Iran, Afghanistan and\nIndia collectively march ahead in a planned way for the construction of\nChabahar Port, an impossible task becomes possible.\n\nMy brothers and Sisters, one thing, I want to talk about and which concerns\nthe common man is inflation. It is true that the inflation rate had crossed\n10% mark during the tenure of previous government. Due to our sustained\nefforts we were able to keep it below 6 percent. Not only this, we have,\nrecently, made an agreement with the Reserve Bank of India that the RBI\nshould take steps to control the inflation at the level of 4 percent with\nallowance of plus minus 2. We should leave behind the talks of balance\nbetween inflation and growth and work for moving ahead. But the country\nwitnessed drought during last two years and the effect of drought are\nreadily seen on the prices of vegetables and the outcomes of sluggishness\nof market have resulted in some problems. The decline in the production of\npulses due to drought during last two years was also a cause of concern.\nBut, Brothers and Sisters, if the inflation would have increased at the same\npace as it had previously increased, I don’t know how the poor of my\ncountry would have survived? We have tried our best to keep it under\ncheck, but still people have lot of expectations from this government and\ndear countrymen your expectations are natural and I will not leave no stone\nunturned in achieving them. Whatever best I can do, I shall do that and\nkeep the price of poor man’s meal under check.\n\nMy dear Brothers and Sisters, country is going to celebrate the 350th\nanniversary of Guru Gobind Singhji. How can the country forget the saga of\nsacrifice which has been the tradition of Sikh Gurus? Today, when we are\ncelebrating the 350th anniversary of Guru Gobind Singhji, I recall one best\nthought expressed by Guruji. Guru Gobind Singhji use to say, how can I\nconsider those hands pure which have not done any service, hands which\nhave not strengthened by labour and have not developed any blisters by\ntoiling hard? Guru Gobind Singhji use to say this. Today, when we are\ncelebrating the 350th anniversary of Guru Gobind Singhji I remember our\nfarmers. Whose hands are more pure than theirs? Whose hearts are more\npious than their? Whose intentions can be more pure than theirs? I thanks\nour farmers that despite two years of drought, they consistently endeavored\nto fill our granaries, I greet them for this. Drought situation has changed\nand this time we are witnessing good monsoon. Heavy rains have also\ncreated problems at some places. Government of India stood with those\nstates and citizen who suffered due to heavy rains. Today, I specially want\nto thank our farmers, because, when we are facing shortage of pulses and\nour farmers have shifted to other crops, and rise in demand of pulses by\ncommon man, I have to say this with content that this time our farmers\nhave increased the sowing by one and half times. I want to thank our\nfarmers because they have come forward to solve the problem of the crisis\nof pulses and find its solution. We have decided the MSP for pulses and\ndeclared a bonus on it. We have streamlined the process of purchase of\npulses and promoting the farmers for cultivation of pulses. This will benefit\nus in a big way.\n\nBrothers and Sisters, when I was talking about work culture, one thing was\nclear that I do not look at the issues in isolation but as a whole. Let us see it\nas integrated and just take agriculture under integrated things, we have\ndeveloped such work culture with lot of hard work, the complete chain of\nwhich can produce a great result. First of all we focussed upon- the\nwellness of this soil, wellness of this land, soil health card, macro-nutrition,\nconcern for micro-nutrition and made the farmers understand that this is\nlacuna in your soil, these are the good qualities, your soil is good for this\ncrop, this is not suitable for this crop and gradually the farmers started their\nplanning according to this soil health card. The people, who have planned,\ntell me, sir our expenditure has been reduced up to 25 percent and 30\npercent increase is being visible our production. This number is less at\npresent, but in future as soon as this may pass on, this concept will gain\nmomentum. The farmers have land and if they get water, then the farmer of\nmy country has the power to produce gold out of the soil. The farmer of my\ncountry has this power and that is why we have emphasized upon\nwater-management, emphasized upon water-irrigation, emphasized upon\nwater-conservation. We are emphasizing upon how every drop of water\nmay be utilised by the farmer, how to increase the importance of water, and\nget per drop more crop, micro irrigation. More than 90 percent irrigation\nprojects were lying incomplete and stalled. We have taken up the\nresponsibility to complete those projects first of all and will work in the\ndirection that lakh of hectares of land may get the benefit of irrigation. We\nhave taken a big leap towards solar pump so that the input cost of the\nfarmers may be lessened because nowadays the farmers require electricity\nalso, they require water, they need electricity, and electricity costs dearer.\nOn account of it, the input cost of the farmer is going to be less, the\nrecurring expenditure is going to be less and due to owning solar pump at\nhome will result in owning electricity, owning the sun, owning the field,\nowing the barn and thus our farmer would be happy. We have succeeded\nin distributing 77 thousands solar pumps till now.\n\nBrothers and Sisters, I would like to congratulate the scientists of our\ncountry. Good quality seeds are also required along with soil, water and\nsolar pumps. The scientists of our country have developed more than 131\nnew farmable seeds compatible to the climate and nature of India, which\nhave the capacity to enhance our per hectare production. The values they\nretain are also being increased. I heartly congratulate these scientists also.\nThe farmers require urea as well as fertilisers. There was time when black\nmarketing was in practice to get the fertilisers, there was time when the\npolice had to lathi-charge for fertilisers. There was time when the farmer\nused to watch his crop being damaged in the absence of fertilisers before\nhis very eyes. Brothers and Sisters, the lack of fertilisers has become a\nmatter of past, it has become history now. Today, we have succeeded in\nutmost production of fertiliser by overcoming the shortage of the fertiliser.\n\nBrothers and Sisters, because of this production, the fertilizers are now\navailable to the farmers in time as per their needs. Similarly, We\nconceptualized “Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana”. It’s insurance cover\nincludes maximum protection to farmer’s land and his agro-produce at a\ncomparatively much lower premium, and that too with a guaranteed cover.\nWe have constructed new warehouses to preserve 15 lakhs tons of food\ngrains. Our country’s farmers will benefit only when we move towards value\naddition, and for this We have laid special emphasis on food processing for\nthe first time. We have encouraged cent percent Foreign Direct Investment\nwhich would augment agro-based industries, and Consequentially, my\nbrothers and Sisters, I believe it would help me and our farmers realize our\ndream of doubling latter’s income by 2022. These efforts would make it\npossible and for realizing the same, We have taken steps one after\nanother.\nBrothers and Sisters, Our country has a fancy for a trend. And the\nGovernments, with an aim to leave an impression, have done a lot, and to\nfill the bill in this country, People go for some populist things and empty the\nexchequer. Governments have a trend of establishing an identity. Brothers\nand Sisters, I have tried my best to stay away from this allurement, and\nWhile doing so, I have tried to do several things in every range with the\nmantra of Total transformation, Transformation with transparency, Reform,\nPerform and Transform.\n\nBrothers and Sisters, We are far more committed to build the image of\nHindustan than that of our Government. Regardless of party’s identity, the\nCountry’s identity holds primacy. For, If the Country moves on, it will yield\ndividends for the coming generations, for centuries, and exactly, for this\nreason, We have accorded primacy to the country’s identity and not to our\nparty. Now a days, You must have observed the scope of our work in\nRailways. While we are talking about having Bio-toilets in train, we also\ncherish the dream of Bullet train. While We talk about “Soil Health Card” for\nfarmers, we also want to march ahead in the direction of satellite and space\ntechnology. While talking about “Stand-Up India”, we are also taking steps\ntowards “Start-Up India”. We are laying emphasis on Substance than on\nSymbolism. We are stressing on integrated development than on isolated\ndevelopment. Leaving aside entitlement, we are focused and emphatic on\nEmpowerment because an empowering country, my brothers and Sisters,\nprovides an identity to the Government through the prism of the newly\ndeclared schemes. But sometimes the old schemes just tumble down.\nNevertheless, the Govts. is a continuity. If the earlier Govts. have done\nsome work; then it is in the national interest that the next Government\nrectifies their shortcomings and gives a go ahead to these schemes. The\narrogance that this was the work of your Government and this is my Govt;\nhence we would not do this work; is not in the fitness of the things in a\ndemocracy. This is why, with all humility, we have given similar importance\nto the schemes of the previous governments. This is the hallmark of our\nwork culture as our nation is a continuous and a ceaseless system and we\nwish to retain that system. This is why, I have a project called PRAGATI.\nUnder this project, every month, I myself sit and review all the on going\nprojects. You would be amazed to know that almost 119 projects worth Rs.\nseven and a half lakh crores started by various previous Govts. were lying\npending. I got all of them going. I said, so much of money have been spent\non them, so, all these projects should be completed. Now they are all on\nthe way to completion. We created a project monitoring group. I asked\nthem to look into all such projects and find out as to when were they\nstarted. I came to know that some of them were started 20 years ago, the\nother were started somewhere between twenty five to thirty to fifteen years\nearlier. The people living in the areas of these projects know all. We\nidentified such two hundred and seventy projects worth Rs. 10 Lakhs\ncrores which were inaugurated by some earlier govts. and some crores of\nrupees were spent on all of them; but all that money was going down the\ndrain. We started all such stuck up projects once again. Brothers and\nSisters, such helding up and delaying of the schemes after having spent\ncrores of rupees on them is a criminal negligence and we have tried to tide\nover such things.\n\nBrothers and Sisters, earlier railway projects took at least two years in\ngetting sanctions. A train is passing from somewhere, road have also been\nmade on the both side; a rail over bridge is to be constructed. But the\napproval took two years. We have speeded up the approval process and\nhave been able to shorten the approval time to three or four months, or\nmaximum to six months.\n\nBrothers and Sisters, however fast we may work, whatsoever may be the\nnumber of the schemes started by us; the touchstone of good\nadministration of any Government lies in the last man delivery or the\nbenefits accrued to that person. So, this has to be taken care off. Brothers\nand Sisters, when policies are clear, intentions are clear; then the\nsentiments behind the decisions are also a class apart and the decisions\ncan be taken unhesitantly. So, due to the correct policies and the correct\nintentions our Government is taking unhesitant decisions and giving\nemphasis on the last man delivery.\n\nWe have seen and if you also go through the newspapers of Uttar Pradesh,\nevery year there were stories about the outstanding balance of Sugar Cane\nfarmers. Every year, there was news that this is not being done by the\nsugar mill owners, that was not being done by the state Govt, that sugar\ncane farmers are in distress. Thousands of crores of the rupees was\noutstanding. So, we made schemes in this regard and tired to ensure the\nlast man delivery and also ensured that the amount should reach to the\nfarmers. Brothers and Sisters, out of the total old outstanding balance of\nthe thousands of crores of rupees, I would like to inform you with a lot of\nsatisfaction that almost 99.5% has been settled. It has happened for the\nfirst time after many years. I can point out in solace that all the sugarcane\nwhich was procured and which came for marketing this time for that almost\n95 per cent of farmers have got the price of sugarcane produced and I am\nsure and I believe that the remaining 5 percent of farmers will also be paid\nin the coming days.\n\nBrothers & Sisters, We have initiated a mission to provide LPG\nConnections to the poor families. We have launched a dynamic mission\nunder \"Ujawala\" scheme to get rid of smokes emanating from chulha for my\npoor mothers. A target has been laid down to provide gas connections to 5\ncrores poor families within 3 years. Efforts are in progress and we have\nalready provided gas connections to around 50 lakhs and that also have\nbeen done merely within the last hundred days - you can imagine - that it\nmay be possible to achieve the said target even before three years. We\nintend to emphasis upon Last Mile Delivery in this mission.\n\nPost has steadily become irrelevant due to onlining of our Post Offices,\nInformation Technology, Whatsapp, messages, e-mail. Our country is\nknown as the chains of Post Offices and we have revamped these post\noffices. Post Offices are linked with poor and marginalised people.\nPostman is the only representative of the Government who is linked with\nthe feelings and affections of the common man. We have never\nsafeguarded the interests of the Post Man who has always got the\naffections of everyone and the postman always cares for common people.\nWe have taken measures to convert our post office into a Payment Bank.\nBy setting of these Payment Banks, a network of Banks will be set up\nacross the villages in the country. People will get the benefits of Jan-Dhan\naccount. The funds of MGNREGA for the common man is now being\ntransferred into their respective accounts through 'AADHAAR', the cases of\ncorruption are decreasing. Everyone will be benefitted through the mission\nof converting the Post Office into a Payment Bank.\n\nBrothers & Sisters, PSUs in our country are merely set up for loss-making\nunits or for turning into sick units slowly and steadily or for disinvestment.\nThis has been the common practice in the past. We have strived to launch\na new work-culture. Today, I can point out in satisfaction that we have\nsucceeded to turn the operation of so called notorious Air India into an\noperational profit-making undertaking during the last year. It is a fact that\nwhich all the Telcom companies of the world are profit-making units, the\nBSNL was turning into a heavy loss-making undertaking. We have\nsucceeded in bringing BSNL to operational profit for the first time. Nobody\nbelieved that the Shipping Corporation of India could also rake in profit,\nnow it is bringing profit. There was a time when it was apprehended that\nhow would a power factory last for a week. Whether we would be able to\nget coal for them or not. It also used to be reported that power factories\nhave been shut down for want of coal. Now, we have sufficient stock of\ncoal at the threshold of the power factories. It could be used for months by\nthem. Dear Brothers & Sisters, we have achieved it.\n\nOften, you must have seen that there is huge talk of corruption in our\ncountry. I have observed it myself that how corruption has looked the poor\npeople from the lowest strata of the society and how huge amount of\nmoney is being wasted. We have linked AADHAAR Card and AADHAAR\nNumber with the Government Policies. Dear Brothers & Sisters, earlier\nthere was a system under which funds used to be released from public\nexchequer for widow pension, scholarship, persons with disabilities and\nminorities and also we used to receive list of beneficiaries. We looked into it\ndeeply and found that even unborn children are also listed in it and getting\nbenefit out of such schemes. These middlemen used to siphon off billions\nof rupees from it and nobody even took notice of it. But under the\nAADHAAR System, we have removed all these middlemen from the list of\nbeneficiaries and directly transferred the amount to the beneficiaries and\nfound that these are millions of such ghost beneficiaries who do not exist at\nall and used to receive billions of rupees from it. Now that has been\nchecked. We saved lot of amount. We decided to find out the needy\npersons who were excluded from that list so that the amount of money\nsaved from it should invariably be deposited into the accounts of those\npersons who want to fight for their rights. We have worked in that direction\nto deliver it to the last man delivery and we have made it to reach it to\nthem.\n\nAll of us are aware of the Coal Scam. Today there is no accusation on the\ncoal auction. No stigma is attached to it. The states which excavate coal in\nIndia, will continuously earn millions of rupees in the near future. There was\na time when the auction of spectrum was surrounded by allegations. We\nauctioned it online and that has filled the coffers of the country, bringing\nabout healthy competition and also fetching benefits for the nation.\n\nDear Brothers and Sisters, today the world is passing through an era of\nglobal economy. Every country today is inter-connected and\ninter-dependent. Economically, the whole world is somehow\ninter-connected in one way or other. However much we may progress in\nour country, we’ll have to keep the global economy, global arena in view;\ncome up to the global standards, match it also to stay relevant, and\ncontribute, and also lead the global economy when the time comes.\nTherefore, we’ll have to be alert all the time. We’ll have to comply with the\nglobal standards to make ourselves up to date. Recently, you must have\nseen how the World Bank, I.M.F., World Economic Forum, credit rating\nagencies and such other agencies in the world have all appreciated the\nprogress of India. The world is constantly watching these things due to the\ndecisions taken one after another by India in respect of legal reforms,\nimprovement in system and changes in approach. We have very speedily\nimproved our ranking in `ease of doing business’ ratings. In terms of foreign\ninvestment, with regard to foreign direct investment our country happens to\nbe the most favourite destination in the world today. We have left behind\neven the big economies of the world in matters of growth rate and GDP.\n\nDear brothers and Sisters, do you know what an U.N. institute has\nestimated about India for the next two years ? They have estimated that in\ntwo years India will come up to the third spot in the economic sphere in\nplace of its present level at number ten. Brothers and Sisters, logistic\nsupport, infrastructure, all these things are taken into account in global\nstandards, comparisons are made with rich countries of the world. Brothers\nand Sisters, while making analysis regarding this logistic support and\ninfrastructure of India, the World Economic Forum has said that India has\nreached above 19 ranks as compared to earlier positions and India is\nmoving up and marching ahead rapidly. Brothers and Sisters, the way we\nare marching ahead with a dynamic and predictable economy in our\ncountry and also in global reference- the recently passed GST law, is also\nan empowering step towards it and all those parties deserve appreciations\nfor this.\n\nBrothers and Sisters, I had talked about a campaign from the same place-\n\"Beti Bachao-Beti Padhao\". We do not do any work in piecemeal. We have\nan integrated approach and I still need the cooperation of the society in the\ninitiatives which we have taken in \"Beti Bachao-Beti Padhao\". Every single\nparent need to be aware. We should honour the daughters, protect them\nand give them the benefit of government's schemes. We have covered\nmillions of families under \"Sukanya Samridhi Yojna\" which guarantees\nbenefits for the daughters when she grows up. We have given greatest\nimportance to the insurance schemes in which women are benefitted. They\nare going to reap its benefits. We have \"Indradhanush Tikakaran Yojna\"-\nbecause if we ensure two things for our mothers and sisters i.e. economic\nempowerment and empowerment against health problems and we educate\nthem, you can take it as an assurance that if even a single woman is\neducated in the family, if she is strong physically and independent\neconomically, she has power to pull the poorest of the poor family out of\npoverty and therefore we are working with emphasis on empowerment of\nwomen, health of women, economic prosperity of women, physical\nempowerment of women in our fight against poverty.\n\nTherefore, my brothers and sisters, \"Mudra Yojna\"- I am happy that more\nthan three and half crore families reaped the benefits of MudraYojna. In it,\nmost of the people who reached to the door of banks were first timers.\nEven out of these almost 80 percent people were from SC/ST/OBC. Out of\nthese too, 80 percent are women who took loans from banks, Mudra bank.\nThis is to be considered that how will these womenfolk will contribute in\neconomic development. Brothers and Sisters! last week we decided that\nour mothers and Sisters who have become the participants in the growth\nstory, need leave after child birth. Earlier that leave was shorter but now we\nhave increased this to 26 weeks, enabling the new mother to take care of\nher infant. Our weavers and the people working in textile, who make yarn\nand yarn rolls, used to get Rs.100.We have increased that to Rs.190 so as\nto strengthen the hands of my yarn producing mothers and Sisters. Our\nmothers, Sisters and weavers who are engaged in silk production will now\nreceive Rs.50 more per meter of production. This has also been decided\nthat this Rs.50 per meter will not go either to the trader or to the middleman\nor to the dealer. Instead this Rs.50 per meter will go via Aadhaar directly to\nthe account of the weaver who has produced it. This will empower the\nweavers. We have started schemes with this intention and effect is now\nvisible.\nMy dear countrymen! When we visualize railway and post office then we\nare able to see the unity of India. More we increase the institutions\nconnecting India, our setup will change and that will enforce the unity of the\ncountry. So in the same tune we have started a new market scheme for\nfarmers with the name ‘E-NAM”. Today farmers can sell their produce\nonline in any of the markets of the country. Now he is not constrained to\ncompulsively sell his produce in the market which is 10 Kilometers from his\nfield .Neither to sell at low prices which is not remunerative for his hard\nwork. Now a uniform sort of market network is establishing throughout the\ncountry with ‘E-NAM’. GST is soon to result in uniform taxation system and\na unitary arrangement thus achieved will unite India as well. You will be\namazed to know that earlier a zone was to have surplus energy and there\nwere no takers. Another zone used to be in dire need of electricity, had to\nremain in dark and factories used to be shut. To effect a change in this\nscenario, we earned a great success with the ‘One nation, One grid, One\nprice’. Earlier it used to be Rs.10 per unit in summers but I went to\nTelangana few days back to find it to be one rupee ten paise per unit\ninstead of that age old Rs. 10. This is the result of one-price system, which\ncan connect the whole country.\n\nA worker of our county has to change his place of work after every one or\ntwo years. But, his amount, deducted under EPF, is not transferred. You\nwill be surprised to know that when I took the charge of the Government,\nRs. 27,000 crore were lying under EPF, which belonged to the workers.\nWorkers were not able to claim their amount, as they were ignorant of the\nrelevant process. To solve this problem, we have issued a universal\naccount number to each worker, which would enable easy transfer of fund\nto his new place of work. Now, the worker would get his amount after\nretirement and it would no more be lying dormant in a government treasury.\n\nWe have strengthened various initiatives such as Bharat-Mala,\nSetu-Bharatam, and Bharat-Net etc. We are working towards connecting\nthe whole country and towards economic development of the country\nthrough all these initiatives.\n\nBrothers and Sisters, this year is important due to various reasons. The\ncountry is celebrating 1000th birth anniversary of Saint Sri Ramanuja\nAcharyaji. The country is celebrating 150th birth anniversary of Shrimad\nRajchandra Ji, the Guru of Mahatma Gandhi. The country is celebrating\n350th birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh ji. The country is also\ncelebrating centenary birth celebrations of Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyaya\nji. While remembering Sri Ramanuja Acharya ji today, I wish to underline\nhis message to the country. He used to say that we should serve all the\ndevotees of the Lord, irrespective of their caste and class. He had said that\nwe should never humiliate anyone and should give respect to all, without\nany discrimination on the basis of age and caste. The issue that was given\nimportance by Gandhi, Ambedkar, Ramanujacharya, Lord Buddha, our\nscriptures and by our all spiritual gurus too is the issue of 'our social unity'.\n\nIf the society disintegrates, the empire straggles, gets divided into the highs\nand the lows, the touchables and the untouchables, then brothers and\nSisters, that society cannot sustain. There are social evils, centuries old\nsocial evils, but if the social evils have become chronic, they need a bit\nharsh and yet sensitive treatment. The lackadaisical attitude will not solve\nthe social problems and this is the responsibility of 125 crore citizens. The\ngovernment and the society together will have to steer through the social\nconflicts. Brothers and Sisters, all of us will have to fight against the social\nevils. We all will have to rise above social evils in our own behavior. Each\nand every citizen will have to rise above them and then only we can build a\nstrong India. Without empowering our society, we cannot make India\nstrong. Mere economic progress does not guarantee a strong India, the\nguarantee of a strong India lies in a strong society. And a strong society is\nbuilt at the edifice of social justice. A strong society is built only on the\nedifice of social justice. Therefore, it is our duty to lay emphasis on social\njustice. Whether they be Dalits, the downtrodden, the exploited, the\ndeprived, my Adivasi brothers, the rural population, the urban population,\nthe literate or the illiterate, the small or the big- the 125 crore of our fellow\ncountrymen constitute our family. We together have to take forward our\ncountry and we all have to work in the same direction.\n\nBrothers and Sisters, today the entire world acknowledges the fact that\nIndia is a country of youths. What cannot be achieved by a country through\nits youth power whose 65 percent population, about 800 Million people, is\nbelow the age of 35 years? Therefore, my brothers and Sisters, it is the\nneed of the hour that the youth get opportunity and employment. Today we\nare heading towards the birth centenary of Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyaya.\nPandit Deen Dayal Upadhyaya spoke of welfare of the last human being\nwhich was even the view of Mahatma Gandhi. Pandit Deen Dayal\nUpadhyaya believed in the philosophy of ‘Antyodaya’. Welfare of the\npoorest and the weakest was the central theme of the political philosophy\nof Pt. Deendayal Upadhyayji. He used to say that every youth should get\neducation, every youth should be skilled and every youth should get the\nopportunity to realise his dreams. We have taken many initiatives to realise\nthose dreams of Pt. Deendayalji and to fulfil the hopes and aspirations of\n800 million youths of the country. The way the road network in the country\nis expanding, the largest number of vehicles are being manufactured in the\ncountry, the country is becoming the largest exporter of softwares, more\nthan 50 new mobile factories have been set up in the country, all these\nthings have created opportunities for the youths. If two crore door toilets\nhave been constructed, it has provided employment to someone, cement\nhas been procured from somewhere, iron has been purchased from some\nother person, and the wooden work has been got done from somewhere\nelse. As the scope of work expands, the possibilities of employment\ngeneration also increase. Today, we have stressed in that direction.\n\nSimilarly, we are working on 'skill development' as a mission so that crores\nof youth could acquire skills. We have changed a law, though it seems very\nsmall, and this law is 'Model Shop and Establishment Act'. We have sent\nan advisory to states to give reasons why the big malls are allowed to open\n365 days and upto 12 in the night but a small shopkeeper in the village has\nto shut his shop after sunset. Even a poor should get the opportunity to\nkeep his shop open for 365 days. Why should our Sisters not get the\nopportunity to work in night? We have made legal provisions so that our\nSisters could go to work in night also. There should be arrangements for\ntheir safety and other requirements but they must get the opportunity to\nwork. These are the things which increase employment. Brothers and\nSisters, we are working in that direction and we are ready to do it.\n\nBrothers and Sisters, this is the government, we are the persons who don't\nbelieve in delaying the things, we know how to fight not how to delay, so\nunless we deal with the problems head-on, it is not going to happen. Today\nwhen we are celebrating our freedom in the country, someone among the\narmy jawans, who live and die for the country, would be ready for taking the\nbullets on the border, someone will be sitting in bunker and some other one\nwould not be fortunate enough to meet his sister on the occasion of Raksha\nBandhan. How many jawans are working in armed forces? More than\n33000 police personnel have got martyrdom since we got our\nindependence. Why should we forget them and how can we? These are\nthe people due to whom we can live a life of peace and happiness. The\nissue of “One Rank One Pension” was pending for many years. We do not\nkeep the issues pending but we face them. We have fulfilled our promise of\n“One Rank One Pension” and have spread happiness in the home of every\nIndian soldier. We did this work.\n\nIt was the feeling of our countrymen that the files pertaining to Netaji\nSubhash Babu should be declassified. Today, I bow my head and say that\nwithout caring for the result we have decided to declassify these files; a\ntask which was impossible and kept pending since long. We invited Netaji’s\nfamily members and shown them the files and this process of declassifying\nwill continue. I requested the other countries of the world to declassify the\nfiles held by them and hand them over to India because Indians have full\nright to know about Subhash Babu and history of India. We have worked in\nthat direction.\n\nBangladesh -- When partition of India took place, a boundary dispute\nexisted since then. A boundary dispute prevailed since the formation of\nBangladesh. Many decades passed. Brothers and Sisters, all parties have\ntogether solved the Indo-Bangladesh border dispute and we have amended\nthe constitution also.\n\nBrothers and Sisters, a middle class person wants to construct his own\nhouse, wants to buy a flat. Builders lobby shows him a beautifully printed\nbooklet and the helpless soul falls prey to it. He is not having any technical\nknowledge, he pays the installments but he is not getting the promised\nhouse in time. A middle class makes one house in his whole life and in it he\ninvests all his capital. Brothers and Sisters, we have put a check by\npassing the “Real Estate Bill”, so that a middle class should not face any\nproblem if he wishes to own a house. We have worked for this.\n\nBrothers and Sisters, I have already said that this year is the 150th\nanniversary of Shrimad Rajchandra Ji, the guru of Mahatma Gandhi. When\nGandhiji was staying at South Africa, then also he was having\ncorrespondence with Shrimad Rajchandra Ji. In one of his letter Shrimad\nRajchandra Ji discussed violence and non-violence. In that letter\nRajchandra Ji writes, when violence came in to existence from same time\nthe principle of non-violence also born. The important thing in both is that\nwhich we prefer or which is being used in the interest of mankind.\n\nBrothers and Sisters, the discussion of violence and non-violence is very\ninherent in our country. Humanity is in our blood. We are the people of a\ngreat, colossal culture. This country is full of diversity, colours and beauty.\nThis is such a bouquet of mother India wherein all type of fragrances, all\ntype of colours and all type of dreams exist. Brothers and Sisters, the unity\nof diversity is our biggest strength. The mantra of unity is connected to our\nroots.\n\nBrothers and Sisters, a country having more than hundred languages,\nhundreds of dialects, innumerable attires, innumerable life styles, despite\nthat this country remained united- its main reason is our cultural heritage.\nWe know how to respect, we know hospitality, we know how to assimilate,\nwe have carried this great tradition and that is why there is no room for\nviolence and atrocity in our country. If the democracy of India is to be\nstrengthened, the dreams of India are to be fulfilled then the path of\nviolence would never bring success for us. Nowadays a game of killing the\ninnocents is being played on the pretext of Maoism in forests, on the\npretext of extremism at border, on the pretext of terrorism at hilly areas by\ncarrying guns on shoulders. Forty years have passed, this mother soil has\ngrown blood stained but the persons on the path of terrorism have not\nachieved anything. I would like to remind those youth that this country will\nnever tolerate violence nor would it ever put up with terrorism. Nor would it\nbow down to terrorism. It will never succumb to Maoism. But I exhort them\nand say that you still have time-return to the mainstream. Just think about\nyour parents' dream; just reflect on the hopes and expectations of your\nparents; return back to the mainstream; live a happy and peaceful life, for,\nthe path of violence never fetches benefit to anybody.\n\nBrothers and sister, we talk about foreign policy. I don't want to go into\ndetails. We had invited the leaders of SAARC Countries on the day we took\noath at the Centre. Our message was clear that we all, neighbouring\ncountries, have a common problem, and that common challenge is poverty.\nLet us fight this poverty together, by fighting one-another, we are left\nshattered but if we fight this poverty, we will walk towards prosperity. So, I\nexhort all neighbouring countries to join us in this fight against poverty. No\nfreedom can be much bigger than the freedom of our citizens from poverty;\nfreedom of our country's citizen from poverty. No liberation is more\nliberating than the freedom from poverty. Whenever a citizen from the\nneighbouring countries would get freedom from poverty, we will feel elated\nregardless of the fact whether the poor belongs to us or our neighbouring\ncountry.\n\n   Brothers and Sisters, what kind of people are those who got drive from\nhumanity and, what is the kind of those who reward terrorism? I want to\nplace two pictures before this world, and I say to the world, I say to those\nwho believe in humanity that just weigh out the attack, when terrorists\nbrutally killed innocent children in a school at Peshawar. The attack take\nplace in Peshawar, and was a terrorist incident. The innocent children\nbecame victim of the bloodbath; the temple of learning had blood stream all\naround; innocent children were slaughtered. Hindustan, the Parliament had\ntears in it's eyes; Every Indian school was in tears; every child of India felt\nthe trauma of the deaths of children in Peshawar. His tears had become\nunstoppable. Every child, who was killed in Peshawar in the terrorist attack,\nached our heart too. This is the drive of our nurtured culture of humanity;\nthis is our humanity, but if you look around, you will find a more to glorify\nterrorists.\n\nWhere innocent people are killed in terrorist attack, and they celebrate,\nwhat type of terrorism inspired life it is, what type of these creations of the\nterrorism inspired governments are? The world will understand these two\ndifferences properly, this is sufficient for me. Today I want to specially\nhonour and thank to some people from the ramparts of Red Fort. For the\npast few days the people of Baluchistan, the people of Gilgit, the people of\nPakistan occupied Kashmir, the way their citizens have heartily thanked\nme, the way they have acknowledged me, the goodwill they have shown\ntowards me, the people settled far across, the land which I have not seen,\nthe people I have not met ever, but people settled at far across\nacknowledge the Prime Minister of India, they honour him, so it is an\nhonour of my 125 crores countrymen, it is respect of my 125 crores\ncountrymen and that is why owing to the feeling of this honour, I want to\nheartily thank the people of Baluchistan, the people of Gilgit, the people of\nPakistan occupied Kashmir for having an expression of thankfulness.\n\nBrothers and Sisters, today when we are celebrating the seventy years of\nIndependence, then there is a big contribution of freedom soldiers for the\ncountry. When there is a contribution of these freedom soldiers, then the\nGovernment is deciding to increase 20 percent in the honouring amount\nbeing received, pension being received by the all these honourable\nfreedom soldiers family members. The freedom fighters who earlier used to\nget 25000 rupees, will now get 30000 rupees. It is my small effort to pay my\nrespects to the sacrifice and oblation of our freedom fighters.\n\nBrothers and Sisters, when we talk about the history of freedom struggle of\nour country, some persons are talked about a lot, some are excessively\nmentioned but the contribution made by the people living in jungles, the\ntribals, in the freedom struggle was unmatched. They used to live in\njungles. We hear the name of Birsa Munda but perhaps there would be no\ntribal dominated district where the tribals would not have fought and given\nsacrifice since 1857 to the time we got freedom. They proved through their\nsacrifice what is freedom, what is struggle against servitude. But our\nforthcoming generations are not much aware of this history. The\ngovernment desires and plans that in the coming days, in the states where\nthese freedom fighters, who were tribals, who lived in jungles, fought\nagainst Britishers, who were not ready to succumb. The Government would\nwork towards building permanent museums in various states dedicated to\ntribal brave freedom fighters, wherever land would be available for the\npurpose, where their contributions and memoirs would be displayed, so\nthat coming generations could be able to know about their sacrifices for the\ncountry.\n\nBrothers and Sisters, in the midst of the debate on inflation, we are\nrealising one fact that the entire economy of a poor household is affected if\nsomebody falls ill. The wedding of their daughters gets stalled, the\neducation of children gets stalled and sometimes even food is not available\nin the evening. Healthcare is getting costlier and that is why, I am\nannouncing an important scheme from the ramparts of the Red Fort for the\nhealthcare of BPL families. Under this scheme, in the coming days, if such\npoor families have to take medical facilities, the government will bear\nexpenditure upto Rs.1 lakh per year, so that my poor brothers are not\ndeprived of healthcare facilities and their dreams are not shattered.\n\nMy dear Brothers and Sisters, let us proceed forward with a new\ndetermination, new energy, new enthusiasm by getting inspiration from\nthose great persons who scarified their lives for our freedom. We did not\nget an opportunity to die for the country but we have the opportunity to live\nfor the country. We should dedicate our life to the nation. We should\nachieve something of substance for the nation. We should fulfill our\nresponsibilities and also inspire others to accomplish their responsibilities.\nWe should stride forward for building of one society, one dream, one\nresolution, one direction and one destination. With this very pious feeling, I\nonce again bow my head before the great personalities of the country, the\nsoldiers who risk their lives for our security on water, land and air fields and\nalso those 33 thousands martyrs who sacrificed their lives for us. So, I,\nhereby, dedicate myself to dream about the future of the country and call\non all of you from the rampart of the Red Fort to speak with your full might :\nBharat Mata Ki Jay! Let the voice reach to every corner of the world.\n\nBharat Mata Ki Jay! Bharat Mata Ki Jay! Bharat Mata Ki Jay!\n\nVandematram! Vandematram! Vandematram !\n\nJay Hind! Jay Hind! Jay Hind!\n\nThank you."},{"year":2015,"pm":"Narendra Modi","party":"BJP","footnote":"English rendering of PM’s address to the Nation from the ramparts of the Red Fort on the 69th Independence Day","source":"Press Information Bureau","url":"https://pib.gov.in/","text":"My Beloved 125 Crore countrymen of India,\n\nMy best wishes and heartiest greetings on the occasion of this sacred\nfestival of our Freedom. This morning of the 15th of August is not a usual\nmorning. This is the dawn of the freedom-festival of the greatest democracy\nof the world. This dawn is also the dawn of the dreams of the one hundred\ntwenty five Crore Indian Citizens. This dawn also heralds the resolve of 125\nCrore people of India. On this pious occasion I also extend my many many\nsalutations to all those great persons of India who sacrificed their lives and\nled a life of penance while making persistent efforts to fight for the honour\nof the country. They even spent their youth in the prison, went through all\nkinds of sufferings; but never gave up their dreams and resolve to see India\nfree.\n\nRecently many distinguished citizens of India, youths, literary artists and\nsocial workers- sons and daughters of Mother India- have achieved many\ngreat feats to make our country proud. They are countless in number and\nfrom the ramparts of Red fort I extend my best wishes and greetings to all\nof them from the core of my heart.\n\nThe vastness and the diversity of India is always talked about, but Our\nIndia has many other great characteristics as well, there is a lot of diversity\nin India. India is a large country. And there is simplicity among the people\nof India. There is unity running through all the parts of the country and that\nis what is our strength; the strength of our nation. Strength of our country\nhas been sustained over centuries together. Every era has seen the\nattempts to boost it further. They have been moulded according to the\nrequirements of realising the dreams for the future, they have been\nnurtured and it is due to that only that this country has reached this far with\nour age old traditions and ever new resolves. Our unity, simplicity,\nfraternity, harmony are our biggest strength. This strength should never be\nblemished, it should never be hit. If the unity of the country gets disturbed,\nthe dreams also get shattered, therefore, whether it is the poison of\ncasteism, communal fanaticism, we don’t have to allow it in any form\nwhatsoever, not allow it to take root, and then we have to cure the poison\nof casteism, the fanaticism of communalism with the nectar of\ndevelopment, distribute the flow of the nectar of development and through\nthe flow of this nectar attempt bringing about a new awareness.\n\nDear brothers and sisters, this country is moving ahead because of the\n\"Team India\" and this \"Team India\" is a big team of our one twenty five\ncrore countrymen. The world might never have thought about the team of\none twenty five crore citizens working as a team together as to how they\ntake the nation to new heights, build the nation and also protect it! So,\nwhatever we are doing and wherever we are trying to reach, it is all\nbecause of the \"Team India\" and we are grateful to this \"Team India\".\nPeople’s participation is the biggest strength of democracy. If we run the\ncountry through the participation of One Hundred and twenty five crore\nIndians, our country will be moving ahead one hundred and twenty five\ncrore steps every moment. That is why we have encouraged this people's\nparticipation as \"Team India\". We have given priority to \"Team India\".\nThrough electronic platform mygov.in, through lacs of letters of the\ncountrymen, through my Mann Ki Baat, through dialogues with citizens, this\npeople’s participation is on the rise day by day. About every affair of the\nGovernment we receive a number of suggestions from the far flung villages\nof our country and this is the real strength of our \"Team India\".\n\nMy dear fellow citizens, this is a fact that there is only one mandate of this\n\"Team India\" and that is all our schemes, all our systems should benefit the\npoor of the country. We should support the poor in their fight against\npoverty and empower them in this arduous effort of theirs because no one\nwants to remain poor and they also wish to get rid of poverty. Hence the\nmeaningfulness of our resources, our schemes and our programmes is in\ntheir usefulness to the cause of welfare of the poor.\nBrothers and sisters, last year on the occasion of 15th of August, I had\nexpressed some of my views before you. At that time I was new, whatever I\nsaw in the government, I expressed them with an open mind before one\nhundred and twenty five crore citizens. Today after one year, standing\nunder the Tricolor from the same ramparts of the Red Fort , I assure the\ncountrymen that in this period of one year our \"Team India\", consisting of\none hundred and twenty five crore people, is committed to realize our\ndreams within the timeframe with new hope, new energy and utmost hard\nwork. An atmosphere of trust has emerged. I had announced ‘Pradhan\nMantri Jan Dhan Yojna’ on the last 15th of August. Even after sixty years of\nindependence; even when the banks were nationalized for the poor, 40%\npeople of the country were without a bank account till the last 15th of\nAugust; the doors of the banks were not open for the poor. We resolved\nthat we would erase this blot and would provide a solid base to the financial\ninclusion which is talked about the world over, by integrating the poorest of\nthe poor to the mainstream economic activities; and this is only the\nbeginning. We had decided that unlike the previous work culture of talking\nin terms of uncertain time frames, we will complete the work by the 26th of\nJanuary as the country celebrates the next Republic Day.\n\nMy countrymen, today I can proudly say that we achieved that target within\nthe time frame. 17 Crore people opened their bank accounts under\n‘Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojna’. With a view to extend opportunities to\nthe poor, we had said that these bank accounts could be opened with zero\nbalance. We had even said that we would bear the operational costs of the\nbank. After all, what for the banks exist? They should be for the poor and\nthat’s why we had decided to open accounts with zero balance. We have\nseen the rich of our country; however, this time around we have also seen\nour poor and seen their wealth. From the ramparts of the Red Fort, let me\nsalute and bow to the large-heartedness of these poor; because even if\nthere was a provision of opening the account with zero balance, these poor\npeople have deposited twenty thousand crore rupees in their bank\naccounts. It could be possible only due to richness of our poor citizens. And\nhence, today my conviction bears proof that it is all because of the spirit of\nthese poor that this \"Team India\" will march ahead.\n\nBrothers and sisters, if the branch of a bank is opened or a building of the\nbank is constructed in a certain part of our country, it becomes the hot topic\nof discussion, people rejoice, it is hailed as a mark of great development\nand remarkable progress. This is so because in the past 60 years, we have\nmeasured the development of the country only on the basis of these\nparameters. This has been the yardstick that if any branch of a bank is\nopened somewhere, it elicits lots of accolades and praises, the\nGovernment receives much adulation, but my dear fellow citizens, it is not a\nchallenging task to open a branch of a bank. This task can easily be\naccomplished through the Government exchequer, but to bring 17 crore\ncountrymen to the doorstep of the bank is an arduous task, it takes a lot of\nhard work, you have to give your heart and soul to accomplish this task,\nyou are required to be ever vigilant. And here I would extend my heartfelt\ncongratulations to various Banks and their employees who have been a\nvery significant part of \"Team India\". I congratulate them for making banks\nso easily accessible to the poor and this fact will bring a major change in\nthe coming days.\n\nAmong the global economic schools of thought, there is also the one which\nmaintains that financial inclusion doesn’t always bring positive results and\ndue to that the system has to bear the pressure of poverty. I disagree with\nthis thought. In a country like India, if we look at the pyramid of\ndevelopment, its base is the broadest. If it be firm, the entire pyramid of\ndevelopment tends to be strong. Today the downtrodden, the exploited,\noppressed, deprived, and the ignored ones of our country form the base of\nthe pyramid of development. We have to strengthen the foundation of this\npyramid of development so as to ensure that these people are empowered\nthrough financial inclusion and this pyramid of development remains\nunshakable. It would stand firm amid any crisis and if this pyramid of\ndevelopment is based on economic strength, it would increase the\npurchasing power of these people to a great extent. And when the\npurchasing power of the poorest of the poor in the society increases,\nnobody can stop that economy to flourish and move ahead. It takes the\ncountry swiftly to the newer heights of development and therefore it is our\nintention to give impetus to that. We have laid great stress upon social\nsecurity and also the welfare of the poor - and thus Prime Minister's\nSuraksha Bima Yojana, Atal Pension Yojana and Prime Minister's Jeevan\nJyoti Bima yojana have been launched. Crores of the people of our country\nhave no social security cover. Leave the poor aside, benefit of insurance\nhas not reached even the lower middle class. So we made a plan - just pay\none rupee per month, not more, that is just Rs. 12 per annum and be\nentitled to the benefits of Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana. If your\nfamily faces any calamity then they will receive 2 lac rupees. We know how\nto manage an economy ! That's why we launched Prime Minister's Jeevan\nJyoti Bima Yojana for 90 paisa a day, even less than 1 rupee. So it is Rs.\n330 annually for the health of one's family - and for the security of one's\nfamily- insurance of 2 lac rupees. This is what we have done.\n\nBrothers and sisters, schemes have been made in the past also. There is\nno Government which doesn't make schemes. Every Government does\nthat. There is no government which doesn't make announcements. Every\nGovernment does that. There is no government which doesn't light the\ninauguration lamps, doesn't cut ribbons--every Government does that. But\nthe touchstone is whether we walk the talk or not. We have laid a great\nstress upon a new work culture. Dear Countrymen, our nation has many\nschemes which are 40 years old or 50years old but these schemes could\nnot reach more than 5 or 7 crore people. This scheme has just completed a\nhundred days, 100 days! I mean it, and in these hundred days ten crore\ncitizens have been benefited 10 crore people! Ten crore citizens of this\ncountry means ten crore families. And this means that out of total 30-35\ncrore families of our country, ten crore families have joined this scheme\nwithin a span of hundred days.\nBrothers and sisters, the uniqueness of our government, of \"Team India\",\nduring last one year, especially the great strength and the biggest\nachievement of \"Team India\", consisting of one hundred and twenty five\ncrore people has been to fulfill the tasks within the set time frame.\n\nLast year I referred to toilet facilities for all from this Red Fort, I also\nreferred to cleanliness. It sounded strange to the whole country for a few\nhours as to what sort of Prime Minister is this! But today in all the surveys\nthat has been carried out in the entire country, this point has come out in all\nof them that if there is something that is the most important factor of \"Team\nIndia\" and that has touched every person, is the movement towards\ncleanliness.\n\nBrothers and sisters, we used to invoke the people of the society and\nmarked the names of various people to promote the \"cleanliness drive\".\nThat was such a period, but today I have to congratulate this \"Team India\".\nPeople from all walks of life whether they are Celebrities, Diplomats, Social\nWorkers, Educationists, community leaders or spiritual leaders or our\nfriends from media, all of them have taken a major responsibility to train the\ncommon man without criticising anybody and without pointing towards the\nlacunas. Today I greet them all from the core of my heart who have done\nthis job but I only wish to stress upon a point- from whom this \"Swachh\nBharat\" drive has gained maximum strength? Who are its biggest brand\nambassador? You may not have paid heed to it, but try to remember what\nhappened in your family? There are crores of such families in India, whose\nchildren are in the age group of five, ten and fifteen and they have become\nthe greatest ambassador of \"Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan\". These children\nprevent their parents from littering in their homes and ask them to avoid\nspreading filth and rubbish here and there. In case, any father is addicted\nto consuming gutka and whenever the father opens the windows of the car\nto spit, his son prevents him to do so on the plea of keeping India clean.\nThe success of this programme is due to those little children. I wish to bow\nmy head towards the future of my country, I wish to bow my head and greet\nthose children. The fact which is not realized even by the elite people has\nbeen easily understood by the innocent children and it is my belief that\nsuch a country where a child is so much aware, so committed towards\ncleanliness, such country is bound to become clean; Abhorrence against\nfilth and dirt is bound to arise there.\n\nIn 2019 we are about to celebrate the 150th anniversary of Mahatma\nGandhi and on 150th anniversary of Gandhiji we have to handover him\n\"Swachh Bharat\" as a tribute. There cannot be a greater tribute to\nMahatma Gandhi on his 150th birth anniversary. The task has just started,\nbut I have to take it forward, not to stop it, not to get satisfied. I had\nannounced such a programme from here, just for a trial, so that I could\nascertain whether \"Team India\" is able to do it or not. I had announced it\nwithout consulting anybody. It was not announced after collecting relevant\ninformation from districts and villages. It just came into my heart and I had\nannounced that we would build separate toilets for boys and girls in all of\nour schools till the next 15th August. But later on, when we started work,\nthe \"Team India\" figured out its responsibilities, we realised that there were\n2 lakh and 62 thousand such schools, where more than 4.25 lakh toilets\nwere required to be built. This figure was so big that any government could\nrethink to extend the deadline, but it certainly was the resolve of the '\"Team\nIndia\"' that no one sought any extension. Today, on this 15th August, I\nsalute the \"Team India\", who, keeping the honour of our tricolour National\nFlag, left no stone unturned to realise that dream, and the '\"Team India\"'\nhas now nearly achieved the target of building all the toilets. I compliment\nall the state governments, government officers of the districts, policy\nframers and implementers of educational institutions, who were involved in\nrealising this achievement. This is not just an issue of building more than\n4.25 lakh toilets. This is an issue of creating an atmosphere of\nself-confidence at a time, when we were so engulfed with the negativity that\nit was being told that nothing could happen, there was no hope, it was not\npossible. But now, the \"Team India\" has demonstrated that we are ready to\naccept challenges, we would not withdraw, and we are committed for our\nsuccess. The nation runs on this self-confidence, the nation runs by\nrealising newer resolutions. We cannot stop anywhere, we have to\ncontinuously move forward. Therefore, Brothers and Sisters, we have\nprepared a plan for the labourers of our country, and it has been named as\n\"SHRAMEVA JAYATE\". Our attitude towards the poor labourers is not\ngood.\n\nIf we meet a person wearing coat, pants, tie or we meet a great person\nwearing long kurta, jacket we salute him by standing in his honour. But if an\nauto rickshaw driver, pedal rickshaw puller, newspaper vendor or a\nmilkman come to us, our feelings towards these poor men are not proper.\nOne hundred and twenty five crore citizens of the country have to remove\nthis deficiency of the nation by their resolution of mind. The persons due to\nwhom we look good, who serve us good, no one is our better well wisher\nthan them and therefor, dignity of labourers, honour of labourers, pride of\nlabourers- this should be our national duty , this should be our national\ncharacter, this should be the tendency of everyone, nature of everyone.\nRecently, we started a campaign of issuing special identity card to the\nunorganized labour falling under certain schemes. They are to get the\nbenefits of many schemes of security through that identity card. These\nunorganized labourers were never taken care of. Similarly, labourers of our\ncountry had deposited their share of hard earned money in Government\ncoffers. Slowly, this amount grew to Rs. 27 thousand crores, but when that\npoor labourer moves to some another place after 6-8 months of\nemployment there, moves to another place after a year or two from there,\nno account of the money he deposited there is maintained. The amount is\nalso so low that he does not wish to bring back the same by spending two\nhundred rupees on fare. That is why Rs. 27 thousand crores of poor people\nof my country, labourers of my country, money earned by them by the\nsweat of their brow was lying idle in the coffers of the Government. We\nfound a solution to it. We provided a special identity card number to these\nlabourers and told them wherever you are transferred now, even if you\nmove to another place by quitting the job or if you move from one factory to\nanother, from one state to another, you will always retain this number and\nyou will retain your money, no one will be able to misappropriate your\nsingle rupee. So, we have tried to return the Rs. 27 thousand crores to the\npoor.\n\nIt has become a fashion in our country- make law for everything and keep\nour courts busy. One law may contradict the other but the law should be on\nthe same subject. Confusion was being created here always. This is not a\ngood sign for good governance and therefor, law should be explicit, law\nshould be correct, law should not be out of sync with time, only then society\nprogresses.\n\nWhere will a poor labourer look for his thing of interest in the pile-up of\ndifferent types of 44 legislations meant for our labourers? We have brought\nabout a change therein. By incorporating these 44 legislations into four\ncodes of conduct, the poorest of the poor and even an illiterate labourer\ncan know about his or her interest, we have emphasized this scheme.\n\nBrothers and Sisters, corruption is a much discussed topic in our country.\nWe must have seen an ailing person, habitually, giving tips to others on\nhow to be healthy. He does not care for himself, but it is the nature of every\nhuman being to advise others that you do it and you will become healthy\nand you do that and you will become healthy. Corruption is also like this.\nThe person involved in it, also advise, the person who is suffering due to it,\nalso advise and thus they advise each other, and this goes on and on.\n\nBrothers and Sisters, I have never made this announcement, but today I\nwish to state, I want to assure my fellow countrymen, I want to tell the\n\"Team India\" comprising 1.25 billion people that this country can become\ncorruption-free. On the basis of experience I am saying this. This job has to\nbe started from the top. Corruption is stuck with our country like a termite\nand the termite keeps on spreading, initially it is not visible, but when it\nspreads in our bedroom and reaches the cupboard where clothes are hung,\nwe find that and when we want to get rid of it, insecticides have to be\ninjected per square meter of land. After so many of years of efforts, we get\nrid of termite. Countless efforts of several types have to be made to wipe\nout the corruption in such a vast country, and that can be done. If I had said\nthat I would cut subsidy worth Rs. 15 thousand cores on LPG gas, then I\ncan say that hundreds of articles would have been written to glorify my\nGovernment. They can say that this man has the power and strength to\ndiscontinue the subsidy worth Rs. 15 thousand cores on LPG gas. It is this\nman who can take tough decision and if it is not done so, then nothing\nhappens my dear friends and nothing is visible. Sometimes people are fond\nof sinking into despair. Until they talk of despair amongst people they can\nnot sleep at night.\n\nThey have this habit. There are some ailing people, who do not like to\ndisclose about their illness and they also do not like to someone inquiring\nabout their ailment. While there are some others who wait for a particular\nperson to enquire about their health and if he does not visit, they talk about\nthis for hours together. I can see that there are some people who always\nsearch for negativism, propagate negativism and they enjoy it as much as\nthey can. Such people neither have any schemes nor activities, yet \"Team\nIndia' consisting of 1.25 billion Indians is ready to invest time for them, but\nhow does that happen? We have put in place a scheme of Direct Benefit\nTransfer of LPG subsidy. Taking advantage of Jan Dhan Accounts and\nAadhaar Card we have transferred the subsidy directly into the accounts.\nAs a result of this the brokers, the middlemen and the blackmarketeers\nhave disappeared. Only the real beneficiary got the benefit. Our\nGovernment have neither slashed a penny from anyone's benefit nor we\nhave made announcements to earn praise. We have improved the system\nand today I wish to inform the 'Team India' of 1.25 billion Indians that as a\nresult of this an amount of Rs.15,000 crore, which was being siphoned off\nannually in the name of gas cylinders has been stopped. My countrymen,\nthe corruption has stopped.\nMy brothers and sisters, you can see how work is done? We have done it.\nRupees 15,000 crore is not a small amount for a country like India. We\nhave launched an open website, displayed a board of delivery there, even\nthen if someone has a complaint, he would get a cylinder even at midnight\nbut we cannot permit those who loot the country and poors as well. Tell me\nwhether this is not a fight against corruption?\n\nMy brothers and sisters, I had made a request to my countrymen that if you\nare economically sound, then why do you avail subsidy on L.P.G? Why do\nyou need this paltry amount of rupees five to seven hundred which you\nusually spend on petty snacks. I had just started giving message about this,\nI didn't launch any campaign as yet, because I have faith in \"Team India'.\nAs the message spreads the result would come, but to-day I can tell with\npride that ever-since I had launched movement of \"give it up\" subsidy of\nLPG gas cylinder, till date 20 lakh consumers have already given it up.\n\nThis is not a small figure. Even if we are in the queue before a temple for\nthe blessings (Prasad), we sometimes wish that we should get some of the\nprasad for our younger brother also. This is in our nature. These 20 lakh\npeople are not from rich or wealthy families. They are all from the common\nmiddle class. Some teacher may have been a pensioner, but when he\nlearnt that this LPG cylinder may go to some poor person, he gave up his\nsubsidy. My dear brothers and sisters, when these 20 lakh LPG cylinders\nwill reach the poor families whose kitchens are smoke choked, just think of\nthe happiness of the mothers working in those kitchens! Just think of the\nrelief and happiness of the little children who had been crying due to the\nsmoke! Whenever our efforts are in the right direction, we get great results.\n\nMy brothers and sisters, if I talk about coal, some of the political pundits or\nexperts will judge me on a political angle. This is not a place for politicking,\nso I would like to urge upon all the political pundits that in this case, the\nkind of coal issue that I am going to raise, may please not be judged\nthrough the political angle. This is the requirement of our nation’s resolve.\nCAG said that when coal blocks were allocated through lottery, the nation\nlost Rs.1 lakh and 74 thousand crores. We also used this statistics in the\nelection-speeches. Nevertheless, we sometimes thought that this much of\nloss may not have been there. But we went on saying like that. Later we\ndecided that whether it be coal, or spectrum or any other mineral, all will be\nauctioned henceforth. Lo and behold ! the great strength of the Team India\nof 125 crore Indians and their resolve ! within a certain time limit the coal\nwas auctioned and now almost Rs. 3 lakh crore would be accruing to the\nnational exchequer.\n\nBrothers and sisters, just ask yourselves whether corruption was rooted out\nor not? Whether the middlemen were ousted or not? Whether the door was\nshut on the face of the wealth-stealers of India or not? I did not make any\nspeech in this regard. I just did it. The same thing happened in the case of\nspectrum. Right now FM radio auction is going on. A lot of pressure was\nput on me. People said 'Modi ji, FM is operated by the common men, there\nin no great profit in this business. Why are you putting even FM on auction?\nA lot of pressure was put on me. All attempts were made to dissuade me\nfrom this. But I said that the team India consisting of 125 crore of Indians\nwanted transparency.\n\nRight now the auction is on for FM Radio in some 80-85 cities. The day\nbefore when I enquired, the auction amount had crossed Rs. one thousand\ncrores. This money is going to be used for the poor people.\n\nBrothers and sisters, what a run the country had at the hands of its\nleadership, how it was looted, what impact was put on the policies! What\nkind of an activity it was that continued in the country? Imported coal from\nthe foreign countries was not given to the power plants near the coasts. It\nwas transported to the factories of nearby areas of coal mines and the coal\nfrom those mines instead was taken to the factories in the coastal region.\nNow, even a small child in this country can understand as to how the goods\ncan be utilized for the place where they are situated instead of going for\ntheir transport from that place to the other.\n\nBrothers and sisters, we changed that decision. Nearby factories should be\nthe first beneficiaries. And let me say that this small decision closed down\nthe shops of the middlemen and the exchequer has got Rs. 1100 crores.\nMy dear citizens, it will happen every year now.\n\nCorruption in a way has become part of the system. Until it is stamped out\nfrom the system, dear brothers and sisters, I’ll keep suffering every atrocity,\nfacing every obstacle but with your blessings I shall fulfill the dream of a\ncorruption free India. I say this to you from the ramparts of the Red Fort\nwith the tricolour as my witness and the understanding of the dreams of the\n125 crore people. It’s been 15 months since you put our Government in\nCentre and gave me the mandate. This Government does not have any\nallegation of corruption against it for even a single penny. But I had said\nalongside that it was like the pests, the termite. Corruption free\nGovernment in Delhi only is not going to solve the whole problem. There\nare problems at the small places right now and the poor are getting\ntroubled. We need to bring in a national level awareness for this. We need\nto comprehend this menace of corruption properly and get everyone on\nboard to eradicate it. Then only can we get rid of the menace.\n\nBrothers and sisters, let me say further that we have taken some very\nimportant steps one after the other to check black money, and that too in a\nvery short span of time.\n\nThe day we formed the Government, we constituted an SIT under the\nsupervision of the Supreme Court. We did what was pending for three\nyears. The SIT is doing its job. I attended the G-20 summit. These are the\ncountries whose support we need for bringing black money back. On\nIndia’s insistence a resolution was passed against black money. All G-20\ncountries resolved to cooperate with each other and send back the black\nmoney to the country where it belonged. We adopted FATCA along with\nthe United States. We have signed agreements with many countries for\nreceiving real time information regarding Indian’s black money. We have\ntaken several measures to check black money.\n\nBrothers and sisters, we have passed a strict law for this. After this\nenactment every week people call us and complain that we have passed a\nvery stringent law. They call it a draconian law and a black law and say that\nofficers would harass them. Dear fellow citizens, we need injections if the\ndisease is serious. Doctors also warn us about the side effects of such\ninjections. Similarly, this disease is so serious that if we want a treatment,\nwe will have to bear the side effects also. I know that people are upset with\nthe law which we have passed. They find it troublesome. We have received\nmany messages for diluting the provisions and relaxing it. Today I would\nlike to tell Team India of 125 crore countrymen that even while bearing the\nside effects, we are moving forward against black money. This much has\nbeen done. It’s a fact that the process of bringing back the black money is\nlong but now no one can dare to send the black money out of the country.\nThis much has been achieved, whether someone believes it or not. Not\nonly this, we have given some grace period for declaring undisclosed\nincome and today I can say that people have come forward and declared\ntheir undisclosed income amounting to Rs. 6500 crores. This amount will\naccrue to our exchequer. It will benefit the poor of India. Friends, I assure\nyou all that we will move forward with all the resolve to fulfill the\ncommitments we have made.\n\nBrothers and sisters, CBI had registered only eight hundred cases in the\nentire one year before formation of our government. We are still new in\npower but we have already registered eighteen hundred cases since we\ntook charge; we have taken action against government employees. You\ncan easily imagine and compare the figures. In the entire one year before\nwe came to power, only eight hundred cases were registered and in the ten\nmonths of our government the corresponding number is eighteen hundred.\nIt shows our ability to fight corruption.\n\nIn 2005, a law namely ‘PMLA’ was framed in our country. In ten years, an\namount of ten thousand crore rupees has been recovered under that law.\nBut you would be surprised to know that out of the total recovered amount\nof ten thousand crore rupees, four thousand five hundred crore rupees\nhave been recovered in the last ten months. This is another example of our\ncommitment to fight corruption about which we are not talking in press\nconferences on TV; rather we have taken steps on the ground and reaped\nsuccess. We have endeavored to change systems. We have taken steps to\nensure that the ‘MGNREGA’ wages go directly to the Jan Dhan account;\nthat the scholarship for students goes directly into their bank accounts; and\nthat there is least brokerage. And I believe that because of these steps the\ncountry can fulfill those objectives.\n\nMy farmer brothers and sisters, last year we had deficient rainfall. It was\nless than required. It affected the economy as well as our farmers. We\nwere still able to curb the price rise. One will have to admit the fact that\nbefore us, the inflation was in double digits. Since we came to power,\nalthough there has been less rain and the farmers were distressed; we\nhave been successful in bringing down the inflation from double digits to\n3-4 percent. We will continue to strive to bring it further down because our\ndream is to provide wholesome meals to the poorest of the poor. However,\nwe need drastic changes in the agriculture sector. The cultivable land is\nshrinking; it is getting divided between families and pieces of land are\ngetting smaller. The fertility and productivity of our agricultural land must\nincrease. The farmers need water and electricity and we are working\ntowards their availability. We have decided to pump in fifty thousand crore\nrupees in ‘Pradhaan Mantri Krishi Sinchaai Yojna’. How will the water reach\nthe farms? Water will have to be saved. We have to launch a movement in\nour agricultural sector with the mantra of “Save Water, Save Energy, and\nSave Fertilizers”. Hence, “Per drop more crop” is our watchword; each drop\nof water can contribute towards producing more crop and hence successful\nfarming. We have moved in the direction of spending funds to take this\ncause further.\n\nIn the recent past, when our crops got damaged due to hailstorm, we\nincreased the compensation enormously. Such an increase has never been\nwitnessed in the past 60 years. Not only this, earlier if there were any\nlosses, there was the norm according to which one would be entitled for\ncompensation only if the losses suffered were at least 50 per cent. We\nhave brought it down to 30 per cent. Never in the past 60 years was such a\ngreat initiative of helping the farmers taken. Farmers need urea. I would like\nto tell once again as to how to fight corruption. “Neem-Coating” is not the\nbrain child of Modi, rather it is an idea propounded by Scientists and this\nidea has not only been brought before my government, it has come before\nprevious governments as well. In our country, urea worth millions and\nbillions of rupees is allocated in the names of farmers, but 15, 20 or 25 per\ncent of this urea is diverted to the chemical factories as raw material.\nAllocated in the names of farmers, this urea is pilfered through the\nmiddlemen. This pilferage of urea cannot be stopped unless we go for cent\nper cent “Neem-Coating” of urea. Therefore, irrespective of the burden\ncaused to the exchequer, we have accomplished the task of doing hundred\nper cent “Neem-Coating” of urea. As a result of this, now urea cannot be\nused for any purpose other than farming. Now, no chemical factory can\nindulge in any kind of pilferage of urea. The farmers will have as much urea\nas they need. Since the urea is “Neem Coated”, even if they use 10 per\ncent less of urea, their land will be benefitted with the nutritional value it\nrequires. The farmers of my country will be having a new advantage of urea\n- I would suggest to all the farmers that even if by chance someone shows\nyou urea without “Neem-Coating”, you take it to be unauthorized by the\nGovernment. If someone gives you a yellow powder, don’t even touch it.\n\nBrothers and sisters, India cannot develop till the eastern part of the\ncountry develops. India cannot be said to be developing only on the basis\nof the development of the western parts of the country. India will move\nahead only when our eastern Uttar Pradesh becomes prosperous, our\nBihar becomes strong, our West Bengal, Assam, Odisha, North Eastern\nregions tread the path of development. These territories of India should\nbecome powerful. And so whether is a matter of infrastructure or of rail\nconnectivity or of digital connectivity - in all these aspects, we have\nfocussed on eastern India. This focus has resulted in the proposed laying\nof a gas pipe line in this region. Who could have thought that the states\nwhere there was no potable tap water even in kitchen, there we are\nworking to supply the gas through pipe lines. Four urea fertilizer plants\nwere shut down in eastern India. Youth of these states were unemployed\nand farmers were in distress. We have made new urea policy and we have\nalso formulated new gas supply policy. This has resulted in revival of\nfertilizer plants of eastern centers of Gorakhpur, Barauni, Talcher and\nSindari. Thus we are working to provide employment to the youth and\nfertilizers to the farmers.\n\nBrothers and sisters, there is a Government Department for Army soldiers\nand for their welfare. In our country farmers are as important as soldiers.\nWhat have we done in sixty years! We have emphasized on the economic\naspect of agriculture. With the intention to have flourishing agriculture and\nfor agricultural advancement, the concerned ministry of this government\nhas been named as 'Ministry of Agriculture'.\n\nBrothers and sisters, Agricultural growth is as important as the welfare of\nfarmers. Only talking about agricultural development is incomplete for rural\nlife style and for agriculture based livelihood. That will become complete,\nwhen the welfare of the farmer is also linked. Brothers and Sisters, the\nMinistry of the Government of India which was earlier known as \"Ministry of\nAgriculture\", from now will be known as the \"Ministry of farmer Welfare\" and\nin the days to come schemes for the welfare of farmers will also be\nformulated alike the schemes for agriculture are prepared and the\nGovernment would make efforts to provide help to the farmers by means of\nsetting permanent system for the problems that my farmers has to face in\nhis personal life, the hurdles that he has to go through.\n\nBrothers and sisters, in the coming days I wish to concentrate on an issue.\nThere has been so many years of independence but even today there are\nabout eighteen thousand, five hundred such villages in our country, where\nelectric wires and polls are yet to reach. Eighteen thousand five hundred\nvillages are deprived of the sun of independence, deprived of the light of\nindependence, they are deprived of the rays of development of\nindependence. If we will keep on following the old methods, perhaps it will\ntake ten more years to electrify these eighteen thousand, five hundred\nvillages with wires and polls. The country is not ready to wait for ten years.\n\nI took the meeting of government officials and enquired from them about\nthe timeline. Someone promised to complete the task till 2019, someone\nassured to complete it till 2022. Some were hesitant due to dense forests or\nsnowy hills, and some had apprehension due to inaccessibility of certain\nareas. But, it is now the solemn pledge of the \"Team India\" of 1.25 billion\ncountrymen that the target of providing electric polls, electric wires and\nelectricity to these 18,500 villages would be achieved within next 1000\ndays. I urge upon the states to come forward and accept this challenge.\nThis is not pending in every state, only a few states will have to strive a little\nfurther. I would not like to count the name of such states, as it would be\nviewed politically and may attract political comments. Hence, it's better to\navoid it. I, therefore, announce the pledge of the 'Team India' of our 1.25\nbillion countrymen, from the Red Fort, that electricity would be made\navailable to 18,500 villages within the next 1000 days, with the help of\nstates and local bodies.\n\nI have taken up another issue of concern, which is 'Welfare of Farmers'.\nSimilar issue of grave concern is the under-development of such mining\nareas, from where we get mineral resources, such as coal, bauxite and\nother minerals. Now, look at the life of people there. They sweat to make\nour country rich but that region is not developed and, therefore, we have\nformulated a special scheme for the development of the labourers and\nfarmers of the region from where minerals are extracted and around rupees\nsix thousand crores will be spent every year on the regions which fall in the\nareas of my tribals brothers, located in my tribal areas. Where coal is\nfound? Coal is found in tribal areas. We have undertaken work to see\ndevelopment takes place there.\n\nBrother and sisters, our youth power is of import for taking the country\nforward in twenty first century and today, I want to declare that if we have to\nmove ahead in comparison to the whole world, we have to encourage our\nyouths, we have to provide them opportunities. How our youths become\nnew entrepreneurs, how our youths become new producers, how a\ncomplete network of start-up by these new entrepreneurs is set up in the\nwhole country? There should not be any district, any block in Hindustan\nwhere there are not start-up initiated in the coming days. Whether India\ncannot dream that India becomes number one in the world of start-up.\nToday we are not at that position. Brothers and Sisters, I have to provide\nstrength to start-up and, therefore, I resolve that in the coming days\n\"Start-up India\" and \"Stand-up India\" will be there or the future of the\ncountry. And for a bright future of the country \"Stand-up India\" shall be\nlaunched when I want to move forward this job pertaining to \"Start-up\nIndia\", \"Stand-up India\", my brothers and sisters, in our country our bank\nofficials have done a herculean task, and when you do a good job, my\nexpectations rise a lot.\n\nMy banker friends, my expectations are rising, so please do not get\noffended, but I trust you that your subordinate staff is contributing a lot for\nthe economic advancement of this nation and in future they will continue to\nput in further more efforts. I want to assign you a task today. There are 1.25\nlakh banking units i.e. 1.25 lakh branches of banks in the country. Today, I\nwould like to assign a task to these 1.25 lakh branches. This year marks\nthe 125th anniversary of Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkarji. There are 1.25 lakhs\nbranches of banks. This is my programme referred to as \"Start-up India\",\nunder this programme more schemes will be formulated, but every branch\nmust resolve and in the days to come resolve once again to disburse loans\nfor start-ups to the tribals in the locality where there is any tribal habitation,\nand where there is no tribal habitation, the branch can provide loans to a\ndalit or a tribal, give financial support to them and thus enable 1.25 lakh\nDalit entrepreneurs to come up. Let there be tribal entrepreneurs in the\ntribal settlements of this country. We can do this, we can give a new\ndimension to star-up and secondly whether these one lakh twenty five\nthousand branches can formulate a special scheme for women\nentrepreneurs? These one lakh twenty five thousand branches should\npromote start-up of women entrepreneurs and help them financially. You\nwill find that within no time, India would see a network of start up, new\nentrepreneurs would emerge and they would in-turn provide employment\nranging from one to two to four persons which will transform India's\neconomic life.\n\nBrothers and sisters, when investment comes to the country, we expect\nmore manufacturing work and more exports and the finance department of\nthe Government offer new schemes to such investors. It has its own\nsignificance and this should continue. But today I have a new idea that the\ninvestment coming to our country in the manufacturing sector should be\noffered assistance based on new parameters and one of them shall be that\nan investor who comes with an enterprise which provides employment to\nmaximum persons would be eligible for a different kind of economic\npackage.\n\nThe Government would now formulate new schemes for new units linking it\nwith employment and assistance of Government. We want to stress upon\nthe growth of employment opportunities in the country. We have reached\nfar beyond in the direction of fulfilling the dreams of Skill India and Digital\nIndia. Brothers and sisters, one area of corruption is job. The poorest of the\npoor man aspires for his son's job and we have seen that whenever a youth\nreceives a call for an interview for a job, may be that is for interview in\nrailway, for a teacher, for a peon, for a driver, he began to think about who\nhe should approach for recommendation? Even his widow mother begin to\nbrood over the issue. why? That is because in our country justice and\ninjustice are mostly decided on the basis of interview rather than the basis\nof merit and it is said that the person has failed in the interview. I have not\nseen any such psychologist till now, who are capable of assessing a\nperson on the basis of interviewing him just for two minutes.\n\nBrothers and sisters, I have been thinking over it for many days that\nwhether it is necessary to appear for an interview for a son of a poor\nmother, for a less educated person who is in need of petty jobs? Whether\nhe can't get any job without an interview? Whether on the basis of his\nmark-sheet online-- it should be decided on the basis of online mark sheet\nthat if we require five hundred people, than who should be those initial five\nhundred people, then who should be initial two thousand people. Of course,\nwhere the testing of physical fitness is required, the norms and system\ncould vary there. Personality and experience of a candidate matters only\nfor jobs of senior ranks, but it is painful to see that candidates even from\nthe states of Nagaland and Mizoram rush to Mumbai to appear in exams\nfor junior-level posts in Railways. I have to combat this problem. I impress\nupon the state governments and my colleagues of the Government to\ndiscontinue the stage of interview for junior-level posts as soon as possible.\nSuch jobs should be given just on the basis of merit. This would help in\ncurbing corruption, which hurts the poor people, and it would ease out their\nproblem. It is my appeal to endeavour towards this goal.\n\nMy countrymen enjoy sound sleep. But, if our 1.25 billion countrymen are\nable to enjoy their undisturbed sleep, it is only due to ever-readiness of our\njawans to sacrifice themselves, who are posted at the borders. No country\ncan under-evaluate the importance of its armed forces. For the 'Team India'\nof 1.25 billion countrymen, each and every soldier or jawan is the strength\nof the nation, wealth of the nation and force of the nation. Many successive\ngovernments have come and gone over the years. The issue of \"One Rank\nOne Pension\" has come before every government, each one has\nconsidered its proposal, and each and every government has made\npromises on it, but the problem is still pending to be resolved.\n\nAfter my assuming office as Prime Minister I have not been able to do this\nby now. Today, I am again assuring all the service personnel and this is not\nbeing said by one man, I am saying this on behalf of One hundred and\ntwenty five crores people of \"Team India\". I am saying this under the\nTricolour from the ramparts of the Red Fort. I say to service personnel, we\nhave accepted \"One Rank One Pension\" in principle but talks are going on\nwith its organizations. Talks have reached at the final stage and we want\nthat all get justice keeping in view the development of whole country. We\nhave to find the solution of this problem in the light of above context which\nis lingering on from 20-25 years. I believe that the trust in which talks are\nbeing held, some positive result will come out of it. And, therefore, I again\nassure that this Government has accepted \"One Rank One Pension\" in\nprinciple. How it is implemented in view of its nitty-gritty situation, we are\ntaking the talks forward by engaging with its stakeholders.\n\nBrothers and sisters, India is completing 75 years of its independence in\n2022. We have not to sit idle after celebrating 75 years of India's\nindependence on 15th August, 2022. Today itself, on this 15th August, let\nwe have a resolution for the 15th August, 2022 that 6 lakhs villages of\nIndia, each village must decide and resolve that by 2022, we will be able to\novercome problem in every village. My 1.25 billion countrymen and we, in\nour lives, take a resolution for the 2022, the 75 years of Independence of\nIndia. Every citizen take a resolution that I will perform this task for the well\nbeing of the country and betterment of the society. Once my 1.25 billion\nfellow countrymen will move forward with a resolution, then by the dawn of\n15th August 2022, when the souls of soldiers who laid down their lives for\nthe freedom will see that the country might have fulfilled 1.25 billion\nresolutions, 6 lakh villages might have realized their dreams. Cities,\nMetropolitan cities, every department of the government, every unit of the\ngovernment should take a resolution and get to work. And there should not\nbe any literature, there should not be any programme wherein 15th August\n2022 is not re-iterated, where resolution for the 75th years of Independence\nis not re-iterated. A momentum need to be created. Brothers and Sisters\nthe movement for freedom lasted several decades. Nevertheless the\nfreedom was in the air only, then someone raised the issue of freedom in\nthe year 1910, again in the year 1920 and again and again in the year 1930\nand so on. The issue was re-iterated for decades, only then we attained\nfreedom. In order to build a self confident, magnificent and prosperous\nIndia we have to make our country competent, prosperous and healthy. We\nhave to fulfill the dream of a well cultured India, build self confident India\nand excellent India. No poor person in this country should remain without\nshelter by 2022. We have to succeed in providing round the clock\nelectricity. Our farmer should be capable, our worker should be satisfied,\nour women should be empowered, our youth should be self dependent, our\nelderly should be hail and hearty and our poor should be prosperous. No\none should remain backward in our society and everyone should enjoy\nequal rights and entire Indian society should reel in harmony. With this\ndream once again I convey my heartiest congratulation to 1.25 billion\ncountrymen on this pious festival of freedom with preparedness to move\nforward in a specific role for 75th anniversary of independence. Repeat me\nwith full strength:-\n\nBharat Mata Ki Jai,Bharat Mata Ki Jai,Bharat Mata Ki Jai.\n\nVande Mataram, Vande Mataram, Vande Mataram.\n\nJai Hind, Jai Hind, Jai Hind!"},{"year":2014,"pm":"Narendra Modi","party":"BJP","footnote":"Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi addressed the Nation from the ramparts of the Red Fort on the 68th Independence Day.

On this day of sacred festival of independence,\nthe prime servant of India extends greetings to all dear countrymen.\n\nI am present amidst you not as the Prime Minister, but as the Prime\nServant. The freedom struggle was fought for so many years, so many\ngenerations laid down their lives, innumerable people sacrificed their lives\nand youth, spent their entire lives behind bars. Today, I pay my respect,\ngreetings and homage to all those who laid their lives for the country's\nindependence.\n\nI also pay my respects to the crores of citizens of this country on the pious\noccasion of India's independence, and recall all those martyrs who had laid\ndown their lives in India's struggle for freedom. The day of independence is\na festival when we take a solemn pledge of working for the welfare of\nmother India, and also for the welfare of the poor, oppressed, dalits, the\nexploited & the backward people of our country.\n\nMy dear countrymen, a national festival is an occasion to refine and rebuild\nthe national character. This National festival inspires us to resolve\nourselves to lead a life where our character gets refined further, to dedicate\nourselves to the nation and our every activity is linked to the interest of the\nnation and only then this festival of freedom can be a festival of inspiration\nto take India to newer heights.\n\nMy dear countrymen, this nation has neither been built by political leaders\nnor by rulers nor by governments. This nation has been built by our\nfarmers, our workers, our mothers and sisters, our youth. The country has\nreached here today because of generation to generation rigours\nundertaken by our sages, our saints, our maestros, our teachers, our\nscientists and social workers. These great people and these great\ngenerations, who had worked for the country throughout their lives, deserve\nour deepest respect. This is the beauty of India's Constitution, this is its\ncapability which has made it possible that today a boy from small town, a\npoor family has got the opportunity to pay homage to the tri-colour of India\nat the ramparts of Lal Quila (Red Fort). This is the strength of India's\ndemocracy. This is an invaluable legacy which we have inherited from our\narchitects of the constitution. I pay my respects to those architects of the\nconstitution of India today.\n\nBrothers and sisters, today if we have reached here after independence, it\nis because of the contribution of all the Prime Ministers, all the\ngovernments and even the governments of all the States. I want to express\nmy feelings of respect and gratitude to all those previous governments and\nex-Prime Ministers who have endeavoured to take our present day India to\nsuch heights and who have added to the country's glory.\n\nThis country has been built on such foundation of ancient cultural heritage,\nwhere we were told of only one mantra during Vedic period, which is\nindicative of our work culture, which we have learnt, we have memorized –\n“Sangachchhdhvam Samvadadhvam sam wo manansi jaanataam.” We\nwalk together, we move together, we think together, we resolve together\nand together we take this country forward. Having imbibed this basic\nmantra, 125 crores of countrymen have taken the nation forward.\nYesterday only the first Parliamentary Session of the new Government had\nconcluded. Today, I can proudly say that the Session of Parliament reflects\nour thinking and it is a reflection of our intentions. We are not for moving\nforward on the basis of majority, we are not interested to move forward by\nvirtue of majority. We want to move ahead on the basis of strong\nconsensus. “Sangachhadhwam” and, therefore, the nation has witnessed\nthe entire Session of Parliament. Having taken all the Parties and\nOpposition along while working shoulder to shoulder, we achieved an\nunprecedented success and the credit for this does not go to the Prime\nMinister alone, the credit does not go to the people sitting in the\nGovernment, the credit for this goes to the Opposition also, the credit goes\nto all the leaders of Opposition too and also all the Members from\nOpposition. From the ramparts of Red Fort, quite proudly I salute all the\nMembers of Parliament, I also salute all the Political Parties and by virtue of\ntheir strong support, we could take some important decisions intended to\ntake the nation forward and yesterday the Session of Parliament had\nconcluded.\n\nBrothers and sisters, I am an outsider for Delhi, I am not a native of Delhi. I\nhave no idea about the administration and working of this place. I have\nbeen quite isolated from the elite class of this place but during the last two\nmonths while being an outsider, I had an insider view and I was astonished.\nIt is not a political platform, rather it is a platform of a national policy and,\ntherefore, my views should not be evaluated from a political perspective. I\nhave already said, I salute all the ex-Prime Ministers and earlier\ngovernments who have brought the country thus far. But I am going to say\nsomething else and it may not be seen from political point of view. When I\ncame to Delhi and noticed an insider view, I felt what it was and I was\nsurprised to see it. It seemed as if dozens of separate governments are\nrunning at the same time in one main government. It appeared that\neveryone has its own fiefdom. I could observe disunity and conflict among\nthem. One department is taking on the other department and taking on to\nthe extent that two departments of the same government are fighting\nagainst each other by approaching Supreme Court.This disunity, this\nconflict among people of the same country! How come we can take the\ncountry forward? And that is why I have started making efforts for razing\nthose walls; I have started making efforts at making the Government, not\nan assembled entity, but an organic unity, an organic entity, a harmonious\nwhole- with one aim, one mind, one direction, one energy. Let's resolve to\nsteer the country to one destination. We have it in us to move in that\ndirection. A few days back…Nowadays newspapers are full of news that\nModiji's Government has come, officers are reaching office on time, offices\nopen in time, and people get there in time. I observed that India's National\nnewspapers, TV media were carrying these news items prominently. As the\nHead of the Government I could have derived pleasure in the fact that\neverything started going on time, cleanliness got the attention, but I was not\ntaking pleasure, I was feeling pained. That thing, I want to tell today in\npublic. And why, because if government officers arrive office in time, does\nthat make a news? And if that makes news, it shows how low we have\nfallen. It becomes a proof of that, and that's how, brothers and sisters, the\ngovernments have run? Today in the face of global competition, when we\nhave to realize the dreams of millions of Indians, the country cannot run on\nthe lines of ” it happens”, ” it goes”. In order to fulfil the aspirations of\nmasses, we have to sharpen the tool called the Government machinery, we\nhave to make it keen, more dynamic, and it is in this direction that we are\nworking. My countrymen, it's not long since I have come from outside Delhi,\nbut I give you an assurance that the people in the Government are very\ncapable – from the peon to the Cabinet Secretary, everybody is capable,\neverybody has a power, they have experience. I want to awaken that\npower, I want to unite that power and want to accelerate the pace of the\nwelfare of nation through that power and I shall definitely do it. I want to\nassure the countrymen that we will achieve that, we will definitely do that. I\ncould not say this on 16th May, but today after my experience of two-two\nand half months, keeping the tricolor as witness, I am saying on 15th of\nAugust that it is possible, it will be achieved.\n\nBrothers and sisters, time has come to give a serious thought to the fact\nthat whether we have a duty to create India of the dreams of those great\npeople who gave us freedom, whether we have a national character?\n\nBrothers and sisters, can someone please tell me as to whether he or she\nhas ever introspected in the evening after a full day's work as to whether\nhis or her acts have helped the poor of the country or not, whether his or\nher actions have resulted in safeguarding the interest of the country or not,\nwhether the actions have been directed in country's welfare or not?\nWhether it should not be the motto of one and a quarter billion countrymen\nthat every step in life should be in the country's interests? Unfortunately, we\nhave an environment today wherein if you approach anyone with some\nwork, he begins by saying “what does it mean for me?” He begins by\nsaying “what does it involve for me?” and when he come to know that it\ndoes not entail any benefit for him, immediately he says “why should I\nbother?” we have to rise above the feelings of “what does it mean for me”\nand “why should I bother”. Everything is not for self interest only. There are\ncertain things which are meant for the country and we have to refine this\nnational character. We have to rise above the feelings of “why should I\nbother” and “what does it mean for me” and instead we have to think that “I\nam for nation's interest and in this field, I am going to lead”. We have to\ninculcate this sentiment.\n\nBrothers and sisters, when we hear about the incidents of rape, we hang\nour heads in shame. People come out with different arguments, someone\nindulges in psycho analysis, but brothers and sisters, today from this\nplatform, I want to ask those parents, I want to ask every parent that you\nhave a daughter of 10 or 12 years age, you are always on the alert, every\nnow and then you keep on asking where are you going, when would you\ncome back, inform immediately after you reach. Parents ask their\ndaughters hundreds of questions, but have any parents ever dared to ask\ntheir son as to where he is going, why he is going out, who his friends are.\nAfter all, a rapist is also somebody's son. He also has parents. As parents,\nhave we ever asked our son as to what he is doing and where he is going.\nIf every parent decides to impose as many restrictions on the sons as have\nbeen imposed on our daughters, try to do this with your sons, try to ask\nsuch questions of them.\n\nMy dear brothers and sisters, the law will take its own course, strict action\nwill be taken, but as a member of the society, as parents, we also have\nsome responsibilities. If somebody tells me that those who have taken guns\non their shoulders and kill innocent people are maoists, are terrorists, but\nthey are also somebody's children. I would like to ask of such parents if\nthey had ever asked their children as to why they were taking a wrong path.\nEvery parent must take this responsibility, he must know that his misguided\nson is bent on killing innocent people. He is not able to serve himself nor\nhis family nor the country. I want to say to those youngsters who have\nchosen the path of violence that whatever they are and wherever they are,\nit is all because of mother India only that they have got it. Whoever you are\nit is all because of your parents. I want to ask you to think how green, how\nbeautiful and how beneficial this earth can become if you shoulder the\nplough instead of the gun which spills blood on this land. How long shall we\nhave bloodshed on this land, how long shall we take the lives of the\ninnocent people and what have we got after all this? The path of violence\nhas not yielded anything to us.\n\nBrothers and sisters, I had gone to Nepal recently. There I said something\npublicly to draw the attention of the whole world. There was a time when\nthe Emperor Ashoka who had chosen the path of wars, got converted to\nthe path of Buddha at the sight of violence. There was a time in Nepal\nwhen their youngsters had opted for the path of violence but today I\nwitness that the same youngsters are waiting for their constitution. The\nsame people associated with them are framing the constitution. And I\nfurther said that if Nepal could present the best example of moving from the\nweapons to the books then it could provide inspiration to the youngsters in\nthe world to abandon the path of violence.\n\nBrothers and sisters, If Nepal, land of Buddha, can give message to the\nworld then why can't India too do the same? So it's the call of the hour that\nwe renounce the path of violence and take the path of brotherhood.\n\nBrothers and sisters, for one reason or the other, we have had communal\ntensions for ages. This led to the division of the country. Even after\nIndependence, we have had to face the poison of casteism and\ncommunalism. How long these evils will continue? Whom does it benefit?\nWe have had enough of fights, many have been killed. Friends, look behind\nand you will find that nobody has benefited from it. Except casting a slur on\nMother India, we have done nothing. Therefore, I appeal to all those people\nthat whether it is the poison of casteism, communalism, regionalism,\ndiscrimination on social and economic basis, all these are obstacles in our\nway forward. Let's resolve for once in our hearts, let's put a moratorium on\nall such activities for ten years, we shall march ahead to a society which\nwill be free from all such tensions. And you will see that how much strength\nwe get from peace, unity, goodwill and brotherhood. Let's experiment it for\nonce.\n\nMy dear countrymen, believe in my words, I do assure you. Shun all the\nsins committed so far, give up that way, follow the way of goodwill and\nbrotherhood, and let's resolve to take the country forward. I believe we can\ndo that.\n\nWith advancement of science, brothers and sisters, we have a rising feeling\nof modernity in our mind, but what do we do? Have we ever thought what\nthe sex ratio in the country is like? 940 girls are born against per thousand\nboys. Who is causing this imbalance in the society? Certainly not God. I\nrequest the doctors not to kill the girl growing in the womb of a mother just\nto line their own pockets. I advise mothers and sisters not to sacrifice\ndaughters in the hope of son. Sometimes mother-father feel tempted to\nhave son in the hope of supporting them in old age. I am a person who has\nworked in public life. I have come across families with five sons, each\nhaving bungalows, access to fleet of cars, but parents are forced to live in\nold-age homes, Vriddhashrams. I have seen such families. I have also\nseen families with only daughter as progeny, that daughter sacrifices her\ndreams, doesn't get married, and spends entire life in taking care of old\nparents. This disparity points to female foeticide and the polluted and\ntainted mind the 21st century has. We will have to liberate from it, and that\nis message to us of this Freedom festival.\n\nRecently Commonwealth Games were organized. Indian sportspersons\nbrought glory to the country. Nearly 64 of our sportspersons won. Our\nsportspersons brought 64 medals. But of them 29 are girls. Let's feel proud\nand clap for them. Girls also contribute to India's fame and glory. Let's\nrecognise it. Let's take them along, shoulder to shoulder. This way we can\nget over the evils that have crept in social life. Therefore, brothers and\nsisters, we have to proceed in that direction as a social and national\ncharacter. Brothers and Sisters, Development is the only way forward for\nthe country. Good governance is the only way. There are only these two\ntracks to take the country forward – good governance and development, we\ncan move forward only by taking them with us. We wish to move forward\nwith the intent of taking them with us. When I talk of good governance, you\ntell me, when I ask a person in private job, he tells that he does the job;\nwhen you ask the same from a person in government job, he says that I do\nthe service. Both earn, but for one it is job while for the other it is service. I\nask a question from all brothers and sisters in government service, whether\nthe word “Service” has not lost its strength, its identity? Persons in\ngovernment service are not doing “job”, they are doing “service”. We have\nto revive this feeling, we have to take this feeling forward as a national\ncharacter, we have to move forward in this direction.\n\nBrothers and Sisters, whether the citizens of the country should take steps\nfor the welfare of the nation or not? You imagine, if this 125 crores of\ncountrymen move one step forward, then the country moves 125 crore\nsteps forward. The meaning of democracy is not just limited to electing a\ngovernment, but its meaning is that 125 crore of citizens work together\njoining shoulder with the government to fulfill hopes and aspirations of the\ncountry, this is the meaning of democracy. We have to create partnership\nwith the people. We have to proceed under Public-Private Partnership. We\nhave to proceed along with the participation of the people. But, please tell\nme why our farmers commit suicide? A farmer takes loan from the\nmoneylender, but fails to repay his loans. He takes loan for the wedding of\nhis daughter, but fails to repay. He will have to suffer hardships during his\nwhole life. He chooses to commit suicide. Who will save the poor families of\nsuch farmers?\n\nBrothers and sisters, I have come here with a pledge to launch a scheme\non this festival of Freedom. It will be called “Pradhanmantri Jan-Dhan\nYojana”. I wish to connect the poorest citizens of the country with the\nfacility of bank accounts through this yojana. There are millions of families\nwho have mobile phones but no bank accounts. We have to change this\nscenario. Economic resources of the country should be utilized for the\nwell-being of the poor. The change will commence from this point. This\nyojana will open the window. Therefore, an account holder under\n“Pradhanmantri Jan-Dhan Yojana” will be given a debit card. An insurance\nof One Lakh Rupees will be guaranteed with that debit card for each poor\nfamily, so that such families are covered with the insurance of One Lakh\nRupees in case of any crisis in their lives.\n\nMy brothers and sisters, it is a country of young people. The 65 percent\npopulation of the country happens to be under the age of 35 years. Our\ncountry has the largest number of youths in the world. Have we ever\nthought of deriving an advantage out of it? Today, the world needs a skilled\nworkforce. Today, India also needs a skilled workforce. At times, we look\nfor a good driver but he is not available, we look for a plumber, but he is not\navailable. If we need a good cook, he is not available. We have young\npeople, they are unemployed but the kind of young people we seek for are\nnot available. If we have to promote the development of our country then\nour mission has to be “skill development” and “skilled India”. Millions and\nMillions of Indian youth should go for acquisition of skills and there should\nbe a network across the country for this and not the archaic systems. They\nshould acquire the skills which could contribute towards making India a\nmodern country. Whenever they go to any country in the world, their skills\nmust be appreciated and we want to go for a two pronged development. I\nalso want to create a pool of young people who are able to create jobs and\nthe ones who are not capable of creating jobs and do not have the\nopportunities, they must be in a position to face their counterparts in any\ncorner of the world while keeping their heads high by virtue of their hard\nwork and their dexterity of hands and win the hearts of people around the\nworld through their skills. We want to go for the capacity building of such\nyoung people. My brothers and sisters, having taken a resolve to enhance\nthe skill development at a highly rapid pace, I want to accomplish this.\n\nBrothers and sisters, the world has undergone a change. My dear\ncountrymen, the world has changed. Now India can not decide its future by\nremaining isolated and sitting alone in a corner. The economics of the\nworld have changed and, therefore, we will have to act accordingly.\nGovernment have taken many decisions recently, made some\nannouncements in the budget and I call upon the world and call upon the\nIndians spread world over that if we have to provide more and more\nemployment to the youth, we will have to promote manufacturing sector. If\nwe have to develop a balance between imports and exports, we will have to\nstrengthen manufacturing sector. If we have to put in use the education, the\ncapability of the youth, we will have to go for manufacturing sector and for\nthis Hindustan also will have to lend its full strength, but we also invite\nworld powers. Therefore I want to appeal all the people world over, from\nthe ramparts of the Red Fort, “Come, make in India”, “Come, manufacture\nin India”. Sell in any country of the world but manufacture here. We have\ngot skill, talent, discipline, and determination to do something. We want to\ngive the world an favourable opportunity that come here, “Come, Make in\nIndia” and we will say to the world, from electrical to electronics, “Come,\nMake in India”, from automobiles to agro value addition “Come, Make in\nIndia”, paper or plastic, “Come, Make in India”, satellite or submarine\n“Come, Make in India”. Our country is powerful. Come, I am giving you an\ninvitation.\n\nBrothers and sisters, I want to call upon the youth of the country,\nparticularly the small people engaged in the industrial sector. I want to call\nupon the youth working in the field of technical education in the country. As\nI say to the world “Come, Make in India”, I say to the youth of the country –\nit should be our dream that this message reaches every corner of the\nworld, “Made in India”. This should be our dream. Whether, to serve the\ncountry, is it necessary for the youth of the country to be hanged like\nBhagat Singh? Brothers and sisters, Lal Bahadur Shastri had given the\nslogan “Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan”. A soldier sacrifices himself at the border and\nprotects Mother India. Similarly, a farmer serves Mother India by filling the\ngodowns with grains. This is also nation's service. Filling the granary is the\nbiggest nation's service that a farmer provides. That is why Lal Bahadur\nShashtri had given the slogan of “Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan”.\n\nBrothers and Sisters, I would like to pose a question to my youngsters as to\nwhy despite them, we are forced to import even the smallest of things? My\ncountry's youth can resolve it, they should conduct research, try to find out\nas to what type of items are imported by India and then each one should\nresolve that, through may be micro or small industries only, he would\nmanufacture at least one such item so that we need not import the same in\nfuture. We should even advance to a situation wherein we are able to\nexport such items. If each one of our millions of youngsters resolves to\nmanufacture at least one such item, India can become a net exporter of\ngoods. I, therefore, urge upon the youth, in particular our small\nentrepreneurs that they would never compromise, at least on two counts.\nFirst, zero defect and, second again zero effect. We should manufacture\ngoods in such a way that they carry zero defect, that our exported goods\nare never returned to us. We should manufacture goods with zero effect\nthat they should not have a negative impact on the environment. If we\nmarch ahead with the dream of zero defect in the manufacturing sector\nthen, my brothers and sisters, I am confident that we would be able to\nachieve our goals.\n\nBrothers and sisters, the youth of India has completely transformed the\nidentity of India in the world. Earlier, in what manner did the world know our\ncountry? Till only 25-30 years back, if not more, there were many people in\nthe world who thought that India was a country of snake charmers, it was a\ncountry which practiced in black magic. The real identity of India had not\nreached the world, but my dear brothers and sisters, our youngsters,\n20-22-23 years old youngsters have mesmerized the whole world with their\nskills in computers. Our young I.T. professionals have given a new path of\nmaking a new identity of India. If our country has this strength, can we think\nsomething about the country? Our dream is, therefore, of “Digital India”.\nWhen I talk of “Digital India”, I don't speak of the elite, it is for the poor\npeople. You can imagine what a quality education the children in villages\nwill get, if all the villages of India are connected with Broadband\nConnectivity and if we are able to give long distance education to the\nschools in every remote corner of the villages. If we create a network of\ntelemedicine in the places where there is a shortage of doctors, we can\nhave a clear guideline of the way in which health facilities have to be\nprovided to the poor people living in those areas. The citizens of India have\nmobile phones in their hands, they have mobile connectivity, but can we\nwalk in the direction of mobile governance? We have to move in a direction\nwhere every poor person is able to operate his bank account from his\nmobile, is able to demand various things from the government, can submit\napplications, can conduct all his business, while on the move, through\nmobile governance and if this has to be done, we have to move towards\n“digital India” and if we have to move towards “digital India” then we have a\ndream. Today we are importing electronic goods on a large scale. Friends,\nyou will be surprised that we are bringing in these televisions, mobile\nphones, i-pads and all these electronic goods. It is a necessity to import\npetroleum products, oil, diesel and petrol. Second to this is the import of\nour electronic goods. If we move ahead with the dream of “digital India” to\nmanufacture electronic goods and become self reliant at least there, how\nbig can be the benefit for the treasury! Therefore, e-governance is what we\nneed to take this idea of “digital India” forward. E-governance is easy\ngovernance, effective governance and also economic governance.\nE-governance paves the way for good governance. There was a time when\nwe used to say that the railways provided connectivity to the country. That\nwas it. I say that today it is IT that has the potential to connect each and\nevery citizen of the country and that is why we want to realise the mantra of\nunity with the help of “digital India”.\n\nBrothers and sisters, if we move ahead with all this then I believe that a\n“digital India” will have the potential to stand with the world on equal\nfooting. Our youth have that capability, it is an opportunity for them.\n\nBrothers and sisters, we want to promote tourism. Tourism provides\nemployment to the poorest of the poor. Gram seller earns something,\nauto-rickshaw driver earns something, pakoda seller earns something and\ntea seller also earns something. When there is talk of tea seller, I feel a\nsense of belongingness. Tourism provide employment to the poorest of the\npoor. But there is a big obstacle in promoting tourism and in our national\ncharacter and that is – the filthiness all around us. Whether after\nindependence, after so many years of independence, when we stand at the\nthreshold of one and half decade of 21st century, we still want to live in\nfilthiness? The first work I started here after formation of Government is of\ncleanliness. People wondered whether it is a work of a Prime Minister?\nPeople may feel that it is a trivial work for a Prime Minister but for me this a\nbig work. Cleanliness is very big work. Whether our country can not be\nclean? If one hundred and twenty five crore countrymen decide that they\nwill never spread filthiness, which power in the world has ability to spread\nfilthiness in our cities and villages? Can't we resolve this much?\n\nBrothers and sisters it will be 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in\n2019. How do we celebrate 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi?\nMahatma Gandhi, who gave us freedom, who brought so much honour to\nsuch a big country in the world, what do we give to Mahatma Gandhi?\nBrothers and Sisters, Mahatma Gandhi had cleanliness and sanitation\nclosest to his heart. Whether we resolve not to leave a speck of dirt in our\nvillage, city, street, area, school, temple, hospital, and what have you, by\n2019 when we celebrate 150th anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi? This\nhappens not just with the Government, but with public participation. That's\nwhy we have to do it together.\n\nBrother and Sisters, we are living in 21st century. Has it ever pained us that\nour mothers and sisters have to defecate in open? Whether dignity of\nwomen is not our collective responsibility? The poor womenfolk of the\nvillage wait for the night; until darkness descends, they can't go out to\ndefecate. What bodily torture they must be feeling, how many diseases that\nact might engender. Can't we just make arrangements for toilets for the\ndignity of our mothers and sisters? Brothers and Sisters, somebody might\nfeel that a big festival like 15th August is an occasion to talk big. Brothers\nand Sisters, talking big has its importance, making announcements too has\nimportance, but sometimes announcements raise hopes and when the\nhopes are not fulfilled, the society sinks into a state of despondency. That's\nwhy are in favour of telling those things, which we can fulfil just within our\nsight. Brothers and sisters, you must be getting shocked to hear the Prime\nMinister speaking of cleanliness and the need to build toilets from the\nramparts of the Red Fort. Brothers and sisters, I do not know how my\nspeech is going to be criticised and how will people take it. But this is my\nheartfelt conviction. I come from a poor family, I have seen poverty. The\npoor need respect and it begins with cleanliness. I, therefore, have to\nlaunch a “clean India” campaign from 2nd October this year and carry it\nforward in 4 years. I want to make a beginning today itself and that is – all\nschools in the country should have toilets with separate toilets for girls.\nOnly then our daughters will not be compelled to leave schools midway.\nOur parliamentarians utilizing MPLAD fund are there. I appeal to them to\nspend it for constructing toilets in schools for a year. The government\nshould utilise its budget on providing toilets. I call upon the corporate sector\nalso to give priority to the provision of toilets in schools with your\nexpenditure under Corporate Social Responsibility. This target should be\nfinished within one year with the help of state governments and on the next\n15th August, we should be in a firm position to announce that there is no\nschool in India without separate toilets for boys and girls.\nBrothers and sisters, if we proceed with the dreams, we are in a position to\nrealise them. Today, I wish to tell one more specific thing. It has its own\nimportance to discuss the matters and express the views of nation's\ninterest. However, our Members of Parliament do not get opportunity\nthough they are willing to do something. They can express themselves,\nwrite to the government, agitate, give memoranda. Still they do not get\nopportunity to do something on their own. Today I have come to you with a\nnew idea. We are running so many schemes in the name of the Prime\nMinister in our country, there are numerous schemes in the name of\nvarious leaders. However, today I am going to announce a scheme on\nbehalf of the Member of Parliament- “Sansad Aadarsh Gram Yojana”. We\nshall fix some parameters. I urge upon the Members of Parliament to select\nany one of the villages having population of three to five thousand in your\nconstituency. The parameters will be according to the time, space and\nsituation of that locality. It will include the conditions of health, cleanliness,\natmosphere, greenery, cordiality etc. On the basis of those parameters,\neach of our MPs should make one village of his or her constituency a\nModel Village by 2016. Can't we do at least this? Shouldn't we do this? If\nwe have to build a nation, we should start from the village. Make a Model\nVillage. The reason of fixing this target for 2016 is that it is a new scheme.\nIt takes time to formulate a scheme and then to implement it. After 2016,\nselect two more villages for this purpose, before we go for the General\nElections in 2019. And after 2019, each Member of Parliament, during\nhis/her tenure of 5 years must establish at-least five model villages in\nhis/her area. I also call upon the Members of Parliament from urban areas\nto adopt one village of their choice. I also urge upon the Members of\nParliament from Rajya Sabha to adopt one of the villages. If we provide\none model village in each district of India then the surrounding villages shall\nbe automatically inspired to follow that model. Let us establish a model\nvillage, let us establish a village well equipped with all systems and\nfacilities. The birth anniversary of Jai Prakash Narayan Ji happens to be on\n11th October. On 11th October, the occasion of birth anniversary of Jai\nPrakash Narayan Ji, I will present a complete blueprint of “Sānsad Adharsh\nGrām Yojana” (Members of Parliament Model Village Scheme) before all\nMembers of Parliament and State Governments, and I urge upon State\nGovernments also that as per the feasibility in their respective states, all\nthe Members of Legislative Assembly resolve to establish a model village.\nYou can imagine all the Members of Legislative Assembly and all the\nMembers of Parliament in the country establishing a model village. All of a\nsudden, there would be a model village in each block of India which could\ninspire us to transform the amenities in rural areas and could give us a new\ndirection and, therefore, we want to move ahead under this “Sānsad\nAdarsh Grām Yojana”.\n\nMy dear brothers and sisters, ever since our government has taken charge,\nthere has been a discussion in the newspapers, on T.V. channels as to\nwhat would happen to Planning Commission. I believe that when Planning\nCommission was constituted, it was done on the basis of the circumstances\nand the needs of those times. In recent years, Planning Commission has\ncontributed to the growth of the country in its own way. I respect that, I am\nproud of that, but the prevalent situation in the country is different, global\nscenario has also changed, governments are no longer the centre of\neconomic activities, the scope of such activities has broadened. State\ngovernments have been at the center of development and I consider this a\ngood indication. If we have to take India forward, it can happen only by\ntaking the states forward. India's federal structure is more important today\nthan in the last 60 years. To strengthen our federal structure, to make our\nfederal structure vibrant, to take our federal structure as a heritage of\ndevelopment, a team of Chief Minister and Prime Minister should be there,\na joint team of the Centre and the states should move forward, then to do\nthis job, we will have to think about giving the Planning Commission a look.\nSo, I am saying from the rampart of the Red Fort that it is a very old system\nand it will have to be rejuvenated, it will have to be changed a lot.\nSometimes it costs more to repair the old house, but, it gives us no\nsatisfaction. Thereafter, we have a feeling that it would be better to\nconstruct a new house altogether and therefore within a short period, we\nwill replace the planning commission with a new institution having a new\ndesign and structure, a new body, a new soul, a new thinking, a new\ndirection, a new faith towards forging a new direction to lead the country\nbased on creative thinking, public-private partnership, optimum utilization of\nresources, utilization of youth power of the nation, to promote the\naspirations of state governments seeking development, to empower the\nstate governments and to empower the federal structure. Very shortly, we\nare about to move in a direction when this institute would be functioning in\nplace of Planning Commission.\n\nBrothers and sisters, today, on 15th August, we also have the birth\nanniversary of Maharishi Aurobindo. Maharishi Aurobindo, being a rebel,\nmoved on to achieve the status of a Yoga Guru. With regard to the destiny\nof India, he remarked, “I have a faith that the divine power and spiritual\nheritage of India will play an important role towards the welfare of the\nworld.” Such sentiments were echoed by Maharishi Arvind. I strongly\nbelieve in the words of legends. I have great faith in the statements made\nby ascetics, sages & saints and that’s why today at the ramparts of Lal\nQuila I am reminded of the words of Swami Viveknanda. He had said – “I\ncan see before my eyes Mother India awakening once again. My Mother\nIndia would be seated as the World Guru. Every Indian would render\nservice towards welfare of humanity. This legacy of India would be useful\nfor the welfare of the world”. These words were spoken by Swami\nViveknanda ji in his own style. Friends, the words of Viveknanda ji can\nnever be untrue. The words of Viveknanda ji, his dream of seeing India\nensconced as World Guru, his vision, it is incumbent upon us to realize that\ndream. This capable country, blessed with natural bounty, this country of\nyouth can do much for the world in the coming days.\n\nBrothers and sisters, our foreign policy is a much talked about issue. I\nclearly believe that India's foreign policy can be multi-dimensional. But\nthere is an important issue to which I want to draw your attention that the\nway we fought for freedom, we fought together, we were not separate at\nthat time. We were together. Which was the government with us? What\nwere the weapons available to us? There was a Gandhi, a Sardar and\nlakhs of freedom fighters and such a huge empire. Didn't we win in the\nstruggle of freedom against that empire? Did we not defeat the foreign\npowers? Did we not force them to leave India? We were the ones, they\nwere our ancestors only who showed this might. If the people of India could\nremove such a big empire without the power of the government, without\nweapons and even without resources, then friends, it is the need of the\nhour to eradicate poverty, can we not overcome poverty? Can we not\ndefeat poverty? My 125 crore dear countrymen, let us resolve to eradicate\npoverty, to win against it. Let us move with the dream of poverty eradication\nfrom India. Our neighbouring countries are also faced with the same\nproblem. Why not get together with all the SAARC nations to plan out the\nfight against poverty? Let's fight together and defeat poverty. Let us see\nat-least for once as to how wonderful is the feeling of being alive instead of\nkilling and getting killed. This is the land where incidents from Siddharth's\nlife happened. One bird was shot with an arrow by one brother and the\nother took out that arrow to save it. They went to mother- whose bird,\nwhose swan? Whether killer's or saviour's, they asked of mother. The\nmother replied, saviour's. The saviour has more power than the killer and\nthat makes him Buddha in future. And that's why I seek cooperation from\nneighbouring countries for fighting against poverty in concert and cooperate\nwith them, so that together with SAARC countries we can create our\nimportance and emerge as a power in the world. It is imperative that we\nwork together with a dream to win a fight against poverty, shoulder to\nshoulder. I went to Bhutan, Nepal, all the dignitaries from SAARC countries\ntook part in oath-taking ceremony; this marked a good beginning. This will\ndefinitely yield good results, it is my belief and this thinking of India, in the\ncountry and the world, that we want to do well to the countrymen and be\nuseful for the welfare of the world, India wants such a hand to be extended.\nWe are trying to move forward with these dreams to achieve them.\n\nBrothers and Sisters, today on 15th August we will resolve to do something\nfor the country. Let's be useful for the country, we will move ahead with a\nresolve to take the country forward, and I assure you, Brothers and Sisters,\nas well as my colleagues in the Government, that if you work for 12 hours, I\nwill do so for 13 hours. If you work for 14 hours, I will do for 15 hours. Why?\nBecause I'm amidst you not as a Prime Minister, but as the first servant. I\nhave formed the Government not as a ruler, but as a servant. Brothers and\nsisters, I assure that this country has a destiny. It is destined to work for the\nwelfare of the world, it was said by Vivekanand ji. India is born, this\nHindustan is born in order to achieve this destiny. One hundred and twenty\nfive crore countrymen have to move forward wholeheartedly for the welfare\nof the nation.\n\nOnce again I feel proud of the devotion, the sacrifices of the security forces\nof the country, para-military forces of the country, all the security forces of\nthe country to protect Mother India. I say to the countrymen, “रा याम,\nजा याम ् वयम ्”, “Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty”. The army is vigilant,\nwe should also be vigilant and the country scales new heights, we have to\nmove forward with this resolution. Speak loudly with me with full force –\n\nBharat mata ki jai, bharat mata ki jai, bharat mata ki jai.\n\nJai Hind, Jai Hind, Jai Hind.\n\nVande Mataram, Vande Mataram, Vande Mataram!"},{"year":2013,"pm":"Manmohan Singh","party":"INC","footnote":"Prime Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh, addressed the Nation from the ramparts of the Red Fort today on the occasion of Independence Day. Following is the English rendering of the Prime Minister’s address in Hindi:,","source":"PMO Archive","url":"http://archivepmo.nic.in/drmanmohansingh/content_print.php?nodeid=1336&nodetype=2","text":"My dear fellow-citizens,\n\nBrothers, sisters and dear children,\n\nI greet you all on this Independence Day.\n\nToday is certainly a day of joy for us. But on this celebration of\nindependence we also feel pain in our hearts that our brothers and sisters\nin Uttarakhand had to face devastation about two months back. Our\ndeepest sympathies are with all the families that suffered loss of life or\nproperty. I want to assure the people of Uttarakhand today that the whole\ncountry stands with them in this moment of crisis. Our government is\nworking with all the resources at its command to rehabilitate those whose\nhouses have been destroyed and rebuild damaged infrastructure.\n\nOur army, paramilitary forces and numerous officers and staff of the\nCentral and State governments worked in difficult conditions in partnership\nwith the common people to perform an outstanding task in providing relief\nto those who were stranded. We especially pay homage to the officers and\nmen of the Air Force, ITBP and NDRF who sacrificed their lives to save\nothers.\n\nWe are also deeply pained that we lost the submarine, INS Sindurakshak in\nan accident yesterday. Eighteen brave sailors are feared to have lost their\nlives. The accident is all the more painful because the Navy had recently\nachieved two major successes in the form of its first nuclear submarine,\nINS Arihant and the aircraft carrier, INS Vikrant.\n\nWe pay homage to the brave hearts we have lost. We also congratulate\nthe Navy on its successes.\n\nBrothers and Sisters,\nWe achieved independence in 1947 under the leadership of Mahatma\nGandhi. If we look at our subsequent journey, we would find that our\ncountry has seen major changes every ten years.\n\nIn the decade beginning 1950, India took its first steps as a democratic\nrepublic under the leadership of Pandit Jawahar Lal Nehru. We established\ninstitutions like the Atomic Energy Commission, Planning Commission and\nElection Commission, which went on to make a major contribution to the\nprocesses of nation building in later years. The first general elections were\nconducted and a beginning was made towards the formulation of the First\nFive Year Plan for socio-economic development of the country.\n\nIn the Sixties, Pandit Nehru set up new industries and factories,\nimplemented new irrigation projects and opened new universities. By laying\nemphasis on the role of Science and Technology in nation building he\nstarted the work of transforming this ancient country into a modern nation.\n\nIn the Seventies, Indiraji boosted our confidence as a nation. During this\nperiod, we launched our first satellite in space. The Green Revolution\nenabled us to be self sufficient in food grains for the first time.\n\nIn the next decade, Rajiv Gandhiji set into motion the process of\ntechnological and economic modernization. The foundation for the progress\nwe later made in the area of Information Technology was laid during this\nperiod. The importance of Panchayati Raj Institutions was emphasized and\nthis later resulted in amendments to our Constitutions for strengthening and\nempowering these institutions.\n\nIn the year 1991, under the leadership of Shri Narsimha Rao, we\nsuccessfully negotiated a major economic crisis and embraced reforms for\nstrengthening our economy. These reforms were opposed by many political\nparties at that time. But the reforms were in national interest and were\ntherefore continued by all governments that came to power subsequently.\nSince then, the reform process has continually moved forward.\n\nI believe that the last decade has also been a decade of major changes in\nthe history of our nation. In no other decade has our economic\ndevelopment increased as much as in this decade. Democratic forces have\nbeen strengthened and many sections of our society have joined the\nmainstream of development for the first time. The common man has been\ngiven new rights which have led to his social and economic empowerment.\n\nBrothers and Sisters,\n\nThe first UPA government came to power in May 2004. Ever since, we\nhave worked with sincerity and honesty to build a progressive and modern\nIndia.\n\nWe have envisioned a prosperous India. An India which has got rid of\ncenturies old burden of poverty, hunger and disease. Where the light of\neducation has driven away the darkness of ignorance and superstition.\n\nWhere there is social equality and all citizens enjoy equal economic\nopportunity. Where no section of the society faces injustice and\nexploitation.\n\nWe have dreamt of an India where the youth get employment opportunities\nthat enable them to contribute to the noble endeavour of nation building.\n\nWe have strived for India’s voice to be heard loud and clear at the\ninternational level. We have strived to build a nation that is looked at with\nrespect and honour by the whole world.\n\nWe have taken many measures to realise these dreams. But the journey is\nlong and a large distance still remains to be travelled.\nBrothers and Sisters,\n\nWe have recently issued an Ordinance towards a Food Security law. The\nFood Security Bill is now before Parliament and we hope it will be passed\nshortly. This law will benefit 75 percent of our rural population and half of\nour urban population. Under the law, about 81 crore Indians would be\nentitled to receive rice at 3 Rupees per kg, wheat at 2 Rupees per kg and\ncoarse grains at 1 Rupee per kg. This is the largest effort of its kind in the\nwhole world.\n\nWe have been able to implement this law only because of the hard work of\nour farmers. Our food-grain production reached a record level of 25.9 crore\nton in 2011-12.\n\nWithout rapid agricultural growth, we cannot achieve our goal of making our\nvillages prosperous. We have constantly endeavoured to increase\nproduction and to ensure that farmers get remunerative prices for their\nproduce. In the last 9 years, support prices for various crops have been\nenhanced as never before. The support prices for wheat and paddy have\nbeen more than doubled. Many States which faced shortages of\nfood-grains earlier are now producing more than what they require for\nthemselves.\n\nThe average annual rate of agricultural growth in the 11th Plan was 3.6,\nwhich is more than both the 9th and 10th Plan levels.\n\nWe now see clear indications of enhanced economic prosperity in our rural\nareas. In the period 2004 to 2011, rural per-capita consumption has\nincreased four times faster than earlier.\n\nRural wages have also increased much faster in this period. MNREGA\nprovides employment to crores of people in rural areas.\nMeasuring poverty is a difficult task. There are diverse views about what\nconstitutes poverty. But whatever definition we may adopt, it cannot be\ndenied that the pace of reduction in poverty has increased after 2004.\n\nMany States which had been considered backward for a long time, with\nsome of them being called Bimaru, are now progressing rapidly.\n\nWe have enacted the Right to Education Act to provide every child in the\ncountry the opportunity for education. Almost all our children are today\nbeing imparted education in Primary schools.\n\nThe number of young men and women going to college has more than\ndoubled in the last 9 years.\n\nWe have implemented new schemes for scholarships on a large scale to\nenable poor children and those belonging to the weaker sections to access\nopportunities for education. Today, the Central government provides\nscholarships to more than 2 crore children.\n\nMany new institutions have been opened in the area of Higher education.\nFor example, 8 new IITs, 7 New IIMs, 16 new Central universities and 10\nnew NITs. New institutions have also been opened to boost scientific\nresearch. Steps have been taken to attract students to the study of science\nand encourage Indian scientists working abroad to return to India.\n\nHowever, much still remains to be done for reforming our education\nsystem. Many of our schools still lack drinking water facilities, toilets and\nother necessary infrastructure. There is a need to improve the quality of\neducation. To achieve this, it is necessary to lay more emphasis on training\nof teachers.\n\nAbout 11 crore children are being provided afternoon meals every day in\nschools under the Mid-day Meal Scheme. This programme is of immense\nbenefit for both education and nutrition of children. However, it is necessary\nto improve its implementation. The tragedy that happened in Bihar some\ndays back should not be repeated anywhere in the country.\n\nWe had launched the National Rural Health Mission in 2005. The Mission\nhas started showing good results. Both Maternal Maternity and Infant\nMortality rates have come down sharply. A much larger proportion of\nchildren is now born in hospitals. There has also been a large increase in\nthe proportion of children being inoculated.\n\nNo case of polio has been detected in the country in the last two years. We\nhave been able to eradicate a disease which used to cause disability to\nlakhs of people.\n\nThe Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana, which provides free in-patient\ntreatment in hospitals to our poor brothers and sisters, now covers about\n3.5 crore families.\n\nWe have implemented the Health Mission in urban areas also. This will\nresult in both expansion and improvement of health services in such areas.\n\nFor ensuring better safety and security for women, we have strengthened\nthe law dealing with offences against women.\n\nThere has been good progress in the last 9 years in the infrastructure\nsector also, covering areas such as Roads, Railways, Power, Civil Aviation,\nPorts and Telecommunications. About 2 lakh km of new roads have been\nconstructed for connecting villages under the Pradhan Mantri Gramin\nSadak Yojana. More than 37,000 km of new Highways have been built,\nfacilitating travel and trade. More than 40 airports have been built or\nupgraded. In 2004, only 7 percent of the people had telephone\nconnections. Today, 73 percent enjoy this facility. In rural areas, this figure\nhas gone up from 2 to 40. There has been a record addition to our capacity\nfor electricity generation.\n\nBrothers and Sisters,\n\nIn the recent months, there has been much discussion on the fact that last\nyear our growth rate came down to 5 percent. This is indeed true and we\nare trying our best to remedy the situation. However, it is not only our\ncountry that is facing economic difficulties. The last year has been difficult\nfor the world economy as a whole. Major European nations are\nexperiencing a slowdown these days. All over the world, there has been a\nslump in export markets. All developing countries have slowed down.\n\nI believe that this phase of slow growth in India will not last long. In the last\n9 years, our economy has grown at an annual average rate of 7.9 percent.\nThis pace of development is the highest in any decade so far.\n\nBrothers and Sisters,\n\nCountries today are more integrated with each other than ever before. We\nhave endeavoured that our foreign policy exploits this fully to India’s\nbenefit. In the last 9 years, there has been a continuous improvement in\nour relations with the major powers of the world. Our Look East policy in\nrespect of 10 ASEAN countries in East and South-East Asia has borne\ngood results, especially in economic matters. We have also strived for\nfriendship with our neighbouring countries. However, for relations with\nPakistan to improve, it is essential that they prevent the use of their territory\nand territory under their control for any anti-India activity.\n\nThere has been improvement in the area of national security also. Despite\nsome worrisome communal incidents in 2012 and this year, the last 9 years\nhave been good for communal harmony. There has been a reduction in\nterrorist and Naxal violence also. However, the area of national security\ncalls for constant vigil. We have not been successful in preventing Naxal\nattacks that happen from time to time. The Naxal violence in Chhatisgarh\non 25 May was a frontal attack on our democracy. Recently, there was a\ndastardly attack on our Jawans on the Line of Control with Pakistan. We\nwill take all possible steps to prevent such incidents in the future.\n\nBrothers and Sisters,\n\nWe have taken many important measures to make the work of the\ngovernment responsive, transparent and honest. I would like to mention\nonly two of them here.\n\nThrough the RTI Act, the common man now gets more information than\never before about the work of the government. This legislation is being\nused on a large scale at all levels. The Act frequently brings to light\nirregularities and corruption and opens the door for improvements. I am\nsure that the RTI will lead to further improvements in the way the\ngovernment functions.\n\nWe have introduced the Lokpal Bill in Parliament. The Lok Sabha has\npassed the Bill and it is now before the Rajya Sabha. This legislation will be\na major step towards making our political system clean.\n\nBrothers and Sisters,\n\nWe have journeyed a large distance in the last decade. But much remains\nto be done. The process of change that we have initiated will be continued\nin the coming time.\n\nAs I have stated earlier also, rapid economic growth is an imperative for our\ncountry. Without it, we cannot possibly achieve targets such as removal of\npoverty, provision of good quality education and health services and\ncreation of new employment opportunities. The average rate of economic\ngrowth that we have attained in the last 9 years shows what we are\ncapable of. However, economic growth has slowed down at present and we\nare working hard to remedy the situation.\n\nWe have recently taken many steps to speed up the process of\ngovernment clearances for industry, build an environment more conducive\nto trade and industry and increase investment in the economy. A special\nCell has been set up to help big projects with clearances. The Cabinet\nCommittee on Investment is working to remove hindrances in the way of\nstalled projects.\n\nInadequate supply of coal had become a major problem affecting our\nefforts for increasing electricity generation. This has been resolved to a\nlarge extent.\n\nWe will start work on a number of new infrastructure projects in the coming\nmonths. This includes 2 new ports, 8 new airports, new industrial corridors\nand Rail projects.\n\nTo boost Foreign Direct Investment, we have recently enhanced the limit of\nsuch investment in many sectors and made its easier procedurally.\n\nIn the coming months, we will see visible results of these efforts to increase\ninvestment. Our growth will accelerate, new employment opportunities will\nbe generated and there will be improvements in the infrastructure sector.\n\nBrothers and Sisters,\n\nAfter the enactment of the Food Security legislation, its implementation will\nbe one of our priorities. We have already started working in this direction in\npartnership with States. Computerization of the Public Distribution System\nwill be speeded up.\n\nThe Mid-day Meal scheme will be reformed. The meals being provided to\nour children should not only be nutritious but also be cooked hygienically.\nWe will take concrete measures to ensure this.\n\nIn the area of Skill Development, we could not initially achieve as much\nprogress as we wanted. But now the pace has picked up. We have\nestablished the National Skill Development Authority a few months back.\nWe will shortly launch a new scheme under which those who have\nsuccessfully acquired new skills will be given a grant of about Rupees\n10,000. This scheme will benefit about 10 lakh young men and women in\nthe next 12 months.\n\nThe Multi Sectoral Development Programme for minorities has been\nreformed recently. We will now implement it effectively.\n\nA scheme for offering Minimum Support Prices for minor forest produce\nhas been approved some days back. This will enable our tribal brothers\nand sisters to get remunerative prices for the minor forest produce they\ncollect. We will implement the scheme expeditiously.\n\nA High Level Committee has been constituted to collect accurate\ninformation about the socio-economic, educational and health status of our\ntribal population. The report of the Committee will help us in designing\nbetter schemes for their benefit.\n\nWe can solve many of the problems that our country faces by deploying\nadvanced technology. The Aadhaar scheme is a good example. Under the\nscheme, by the end of this year, about 50 crore people will acquire the\nmeans of proving their identity and this will bring them convenience in their\ndaily lives. It will also enable crores of people to avail of banking facilities\nfor the first time.\n\nBrothers and Sisters,\nThere can be no place for narrow and sectarian ideologies in a modern,\nprogressive and secular country. Such ideologies divide our society and\nweaken our democracy. We should prevent them from growing. We need\nto strengthen those traditions of our country which teach us to promote\ntolerance and respect for thought processes different from ours. I would\nappeal to all political parties, all sections of our society and the public at\nlarge to work in this direction.\n\nBrothers and Sisters,\n\nI had stated a few minutes back that every decade after independence has\nwitnessed major changes in our country. We need to think today what\nchanges we would like to see in the decade ahead.\n\nIf in the future we can achieve the same kind of progress as in the last\ndecade, the day is not far off when India will be rid of poverty, hunger,\ndisease and ignorance. Our India will be prosperous and all its citizens will\nbe equal partners in this prosperity, irrespective of their religion, caste,\nregion or language.\n\nWe will also need to build an environment of political stability, social\ncohesion and security for this to happen.\n\nLet us all re-dedicate ourselves to building such an India together.\n\nDear children, please repeat with me thrice: Jai Hind, Jai Hind, Jai Hind."},{"year":2012,"pm":"Manmohan Singh","party":"INC","footnote":"Printed from the website http://www.pmindia.nic.in","source":"PMO Archive","url":"http://archivepmo.nic.in/drmanmohansingh/content_print.php?nodeid=1199&nodetype=2","text":"My dear countrymen, brothers, sisters and dear children,\n\nI greet you all on this anniversary of our Independence.\n\n“The leaders of our freedom movement, under the stewardship of Mahatma\nGandhi, had dreamt of an independent and prosperous India. On this day\nin 1947, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru took the first step towards the realization\nof that dream by hoisting the Tricolour at the Red Fort. The journey we\nbegan on 15 August, 1947 is now 65 years old. We have achieved much in\nthese 65 years.\n\nToday is certainly a day to celebrate the success of our democracy.\nHowever, on this occasion we should also introspect about what remains to\nbe done. We would achieve independence in the true sense only when we\nare able to banish poverty, illiteracy, hunger and backwardness from our\ncountry. This would be possible only when we learn from our failures and\nbuild on our successes.\n\nYou are aware that these days the global economy is passing through a\ndifficult phase. The pace of economic growth has come down in all\ncountries of the world. Seen together, the European countries are\nestimated to grow at 0 percent this year. Our country has also been\naffected by these adverse external conditions. Also, there have been\ndomestic developments which are hindering our economic growth. Last\nyear our GDP grew by 6.5 percent. This year we hope to do a little better.\n\nWe cannot do much about the conditions that prevail outside our country.\nBut we must make every effort to resolve the problems inside our country\nso that our economic growth and the creation of employment opportunities\nin the country are again speeded up.\n\nWhile doing this, we must also control inflation. This would pose some\ndifficulty because of a bad monsoon this year. However, we have taken\nmany measures to deal with the situation. In districts where there has been\na deficit of 50 percent or more in the rainfall, diesel subsidy is being\nprovided to farmers by the Government. Seed subsidy has been enhanced.\nFunds available under the Central scheme for fodder have been increased.\nOur effort is to ensure that people do not face difficulty due to shortage of\nseeds, fodder or water in any part of the country. It is good that we have a\nbig stock of foodgrains because of the hard work of our farmer brothers and\nsisters, and availability of foodgrains is not a problem for us.\n\nAs far as creating an environment within the country for rapid economic\ngrowth is concerned, I believe that we are not being able to achieve this\nbecause of a lack of political consensus on many issues. Time has now\ncome to view the issues which affect our development processes as\nmatters of national security.\n\nIf we do not increase the pace of the country’s economic growth, take steps\nto encourage new investment in the economy, improve the management of\nGovernment finances and work for the livelihood security of the common\nman and energy security of the country, then it most certainly affects our\nnational security.\n\nI promise to you today that our Government will work hard for India’s rapid\neconomic growth and for shielding the country from the effects of the global\neconomic slowdown. I promise that we will work hard for creation of new\nemployment opportunities for our young men and women living in villages\nand cities. We will make every possible effort to secure the livelihood of our\npoor brothers and sister, our workers and our farmers. We will leave no\nstone unturned to encourage investment in our country so that our\nentrepreneurs can make a substantial contribution to our economy.\n\nI believe that this period of difficulties will not last long. Even as we face\nthese problems, we should be encouraged by the fact that we have\nachieved extraordinary successes in many areas in the last 8 years. We\nnow need to replicate these successes in newer areas.\n\nIt has been our endeavour in the last 8 years to empower our citizens\nsocially and economically so that they can contribute to the sacred task of\nnation building. Today, one out of every 5 households in the country has\nbecome eligible to benefit from the Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment\nAct through a job card. In only the last one year we have provided\nemployment to more than 8 crore people under this scheme.\n\nWhen the UPA Government came to power in 2004, we had promised that\nwe would provide electricity to all villages. To fulfill this promise, we\nlaunched the Rajiv Gandhi Rural Electrification Scheme. More than 1 lakh\nnew villages have been provided with electricity connections under this\nscheme and now almost all the villages in the country have been electrified.\nOur next target is to provide electricity to each and every household in our\ncountry in the next 5 years and to also improve the supply of electricity.\n\nNo praise is high enough for our hard working farmers. They have\nproduced a record output of crops successively in the last 2 years.\nBecause of our Government's efforts for development of agriculture and for\nprotecting the interests of farmers, agriculture has grown at an average rate\nof 3.3 per cent in the 11th Plan which is substantially higher than the 2.4\nper cent we achieved in the 10th Plan. In the last 8 years, we have doubled\nthe support prices of crops. We are providing loans at low interest rates to\nlakhs of farmers.\n\nOur children are the biggest strength of our country. If our children are\nprovided with good education and are healthy, then our future would be\nbright.\n\nThis is the reason why we have paid special attention to the needs of\nchildren in our policies and programmes. The education of children has\nbeen made mandatory by law. In the year 2006-07, only 93 per cent of\nchildren in the age group 6-14 years were getting admission in schools.\nToday almost all children in this age group are being admitted to schools.\nMore than 51,000 new schools have been opened in the country and about\n7 lakh teachers appointed in them in just the last 2 years. Now we will focus\non improving the quality of education. In the next few months we will put in\nplace a system of continuous assessment of the benefit our children are\ngetting from teaching. Participation of the community and parents would be\nensured so that they can be satisfied with the quality of teaching.\n\nThe Mid-day-meal Scheme provides nutritious meals in schools for about\n12 crore children everyday. This is the biggest scheme of its kind in the\nworld.\n\nIn the last one and half years no new case of polio has come to light and\nnow India does not figure in the list of countries affected by this disease.\n\nMalnutrition in children is a big challenge for us. We have taken steps in\nmany dimensions to deal with this problem. In the last 8 years, the number\nof mothers and children benefitting from the ICDS has doubled. The\nprocess of making the ICDS more effective is in its last stages and will be\ncompleted in the next 1 or 2 months.\n\nWe had launched the National Rural Health Mission in 2005 so that health\nservices can be extended to each village in the country. Today this Mission\nis being implemented with the help of 10 lakh health personnel including\n8.5 lakh Asha workers. After the success of the National Rural health\nMission, we now want to expand the scope of health services in our towns\nalso. The National Rural Health Mission will be converted into a National\nHealth Mission which would cover all villages and towns in the country. We\nare also formulating a scheme for distribution of free medicines through\nGovernment hospitals and health centres.\n\nWe want to create many new job opportunities for our youth in the coming\nyears. To achieve this it is necessary that we train them in skills which our\neconomy needs. It is our endeavour to put in place a system in which\ntraining facilities are available in many new skills. We also wish to provide\nshort duration training courses of 6 weeks to 6 months for our young\nbrothers and sisters. The National Skill Development Council has\nformulated a major scheme for skill development in which 8 crore people\nwill be trained in the next 5 years. This is an ambitious scheme which can\nbe implemented only through a specialized agency of the Central\nGovernment. Therefore, we are considering the establishment of a National\nSkill Development Authority so that skill development programmes all over\nthe country can be implemented in a coordinated manner. We would also\nneed contribution from the private sector and non-Governmental\norganizations in this work.\n\nCreation of new employment opportunities is possible only when we\nencourage industry and trade. For this we need to speedily improve our\ninfrastructure. Recently we have taken new measures to accelerate\ninfrastructure development. Ambitious targets have been fixed in roads,\nairports, railways, electricity generation and coal production. The\nGovernment will take steps to increase investment for infrastructure\ndevelopment with the help of the private sector. To attract foreign capital,\nwe will have to create confidence at the international level that there are no\nbarriers to investment in India.\n\nJust 10 years back only 3 out of every 10 households in our villages were\nbenefitting from banking services. Today more than half of the rural\nhouseholds get the benefit of bank accounts. It will be our endeavour to\nensure that all households benefit from bank accounts in the next 2 years.\n\nWe want to create a system in which money from Government schemes -\npension for old people, scholarship for students and wages for labourers -\ncan be credited directly into people’s bank accounts. This would reduce\ninconvenience to the beneficiaries, make it easy for them to receive\npayment and increase transparency. For this work, we will take help from\nthe Aadhar scheme under which about 20 crore people have been\nregistered so far.\n\nTo provide housing for our poor brothers and sisters residing in urban\nareas of our country we will soon launch the Rajiv Housing Loan Scheme.\nUnder this scheme, people belonging to the economically weaker sections\nwould be given relief on interest for housing loans of less than Rs. 5 lakh.\n\nThis year we will present the Twelfth Five Year Plan for consideration of the\nNational Development Council. The Plan would determine the future course\nof action on all important matters relating to the country's development. It\nwould lay down measures for increasing our present rate of economic\ngrowth from 6.5 to 9 per cent in the last year of the Plan. The Plan would\nfocus special attention on areas important from the point of view of\nreaching the fruits of development to each citizen of our country and\nspecially to the weaker sections of our society. I have full confidence that\nthe Centre and the States will act together to implement the Twelfth Plan in\nan effective manner.\n\nThe incidents of violence which occurred in Assam recently are very\nunfortunate. I know that these incidents have resulted in the disruption of\nthe lives of a large number of people. We fully sympathize with those\nfamilies which have been affected by the violence. We are doing everything\npossible to provide relief to them. I also promise to you that our\nGovernment will make every effort to understand the reasons behind the\nviolence and work hard with the State Governments to ensure that such\nincidents are not repeated in any part of the country.\n\nWe have achieved success in many areas of internal security. In Jammu\nand Kashmir, people participated in large numbers in the Panchayat\nelections. There has been a reduction in violence in the North Eastern\nStates and we are engaged in dialogue with many groups there so that\nthey can join the mainstream of development. We have initiated new\nschemes of development in areas affected by naxal violence to ensure that\nthe grievances of the people residing there, especially our brothers and\nsisters belonging to Scheduled Tribes, can be removed and their lot can be\nimproved. However, we need to be constantly vigilant as far as internal\nsecurity is concerned. Communal harmony has to be maintained at all\ncosts. Naxalism is still a serious problem. The incidents which occurred in\nPune in the beginning of this month point to the need for much more work\nto be done in the area of national security. We will continue to do this work\nwith sincerity in the future also.\n\nI would like to congratulate our scientists and technologists who have\nenhanced our prestige by successfully testing the Agni V Missile and\nlaunching the RISAT- I Satellite in space this year. Recently the Cabinet\nhas approved the Mars Orbiter Mission. Under this Mission, our spaceship\nwill go near Mars and collect important scientific information. This\nspaceship to Mars will be a huge step for us in the area of science and\ntechnology.\n\nWe have seen a lot of discussion in the recent months about the role of our\narmed forces and their preparedness. I would like to emphasise here that\nour armed forces and paramilitary forces have defended the security of our\ncountry both during war and peace with valour and honour. Our soldiers\nhave made the biggest of sacrifices, whenever needed. Today I would like\nto reassure our countrymen that our armed forces and paramilitary forces\nare prepared to face any challenge. The Government will continue to work\nfor modernizing these forces and providing them with the necessary\ntechnology and equipment. Today, I would like to thank our security forces,\nwho are guarding our frontiers bravely, from the bottom of my heart. We will\ncontinue to make efforts for their welfare.\n\nOur Government has set up a committee to examine issues relating to pay\nand pension of armed forces personnel. This committee will also look into\nmatters concerning pension of retired men and officers and family pension\nbeing paid to their families. We will take prompt action on the\nrecommendations of the committee, once they are received.\n\nOur Government has paid special attention to the welfare of Scheduled\nCastes, Scheduled Tribes, minorities, women and other weaker sections.\nThe special needs of our tribal and backward districts are being met\nthrough programmes such as the Integrated Action Plan, Backward\nRegions Grant Fund and Tribal Sub Plan. Through the Forest Rights Act,\nwe have given proprietary rights to lakhs of our brothers and sisters\nbelonging to Scheduled Tribes on land on which they have been living for\ngenerations. We are formulating a scheme to ensure that people belonging\nto Scheduled Tribes can get fair and remunerative prices for the forest\nproduce they collect. The Government wants to speedily convert the Mines\nand Minerals (Development and Regulation) Bill into a legislation. Through\nthis law we want to provide funds for the benefit of our tribal brothers and\nsisters in the mining areas.\n\nWe will make the 15 points programme for minorities more effective. The\nMulti-Sectoral Development Programme being implemented in districts with\nlarge minority populations will be expanded.\n\nWe have enhanced the amount of post-matric scholarship available to\nchildren belonging to Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, Other\nBackward Classes and minorities. Our efforts to make these scholarship\nschemes more effective will continue.We are considering a new and\neffective law to put an end to the repulsive practice of manual scavenging\nand to provide opportunities to those engaged in this practice to begin their\nlives afresh.\n\nOur commitment to make the work of the Government and administration\ntransparent and accountable stands. On the last Independence Day, I\npromised you that we would take many steps for this purpose. I am happy\nto state that during the last 1 year we have achieved good progress in this\narea. The Lok Sabha has cleared the Lokpal and Lokayukta Bill. We hope\nthat all political parties will help us in passing this Bill in the Rajya Sabha. A\nnumber of other Bills have also been presented before the Parliament. The\nCabinet has cleared a Public Procurement Bill. We will continue our efforts\nto bring more transparency and accountability in the work of public servants\nand to reduce corruption. But we will also take care that these measures do\nnot result in a situation in which the morale of public functionaries taking\ndecisions in public interest gets affected because of baseless allegations\nand unnecessary litigation.\n\nIn my first message to the country after assuming the office of Prime\nMinister I had appealed to you to contribute to the sacred work of nation\nbuilding. I am very happy that today more of our citizens than ever before,\nand specially the youth, are taking interest in issues related to the progress\nof our society and country. Our Government believes that the difficult\nproblems which India faces can be resolved only with the cooperation of\nthe common man. It will be our endeavour that in the coming time, still\nmore people help us in tasks like removal of poverty, illiteracy and\ninequality.\n\nI believe that no power in the world can stop our country from achieving\nnew heights of progress and development. What is needed is that we work\ntogether as one people for the success of our country. Let us once more\nresolve that we will continue to work for a progressive, modern and\nprosperous India.”\n\nDear children join me in saying\n\nJai Hind,\nJai Hind,\nJai Hind."},{"year":2011,"pm":"Manmohan Singh","party":"INC","footnote":"(English rendering)","source":"PMO Archive","url":"http://archivepmo.nic.in/drmanmohansingh/content_print.php?nodeid=1045&nodetype=2","text":"My dear countrymen,\n\nI heartily greet 120 crore Indians on the 64th anniversary of our\nindependence.\n\nI have been addressing you from the historic Red Fort for the last seven\nyears. In these seven years, our country has achieved much. During this\nperiod, we have travelled rapidly on the path of development and have\nseen success in many areas. However, I am also well aware that a lot\nremains to be done. We have to banish poverty and illiteracy from our\ncountry. We have to provide the common man with access to improved\nhealth services. We have to provide employment opportunities to each one\nof our youth.\n\nThe road ahead is long and arduous. Particularly, the prevailing situation\nboth inside and outside the country is such that if we do not act with\nunderstanding and restraint, our security and prosperity can get adversely\naffected. The world economy is slowing down. The developed countries\nespecially America and countries of Western Europe are facing economic\nproblems. There is unrest in many Arab countries of the Middle East. There\nare some people who want to create disturbances in the country so that our\nprogress gets stalled. All this can have a negative impact on us. But we will\nnot let this happen. I know that if we work together, we can face any\nchallenge. However, it is necessary that we rise above personal or political\ninterests and build consensus on issues of vital national importance.\n\nBrothers and sisters,\n\nWe are building the edifice of modern India on the foundation of the hard\nwork and sacrifices of our soldiers, our farmers and our workers. We will\nnot let their hard work and sacrifices go waste. We will convert the dreams\nof our freedom fighters into reality.\nBrothers and sisters,\n\nIn the last seven years, our government has strived for political stability and\nsocial and economic progress. We have established an environment of\ncommunal harmony in the country.\n\nIn these seven years, the pace of our economic development has been\nrapid. We have achieved this success despite the global economic\nslow-down of 2008 and rising prices of energy and commodities in world\nmarkets.\n\nWe have strived for reducing inequalities in the country. In the last seven\nyears, we have taken special care of the needs of our brothers and sisters\nfrom the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, minorities, women and\nchildren.\n\nWe have enacted laws which would guarantee our people their basic\nentitlements. After the rights to education, employment and information, we\nwill soon enact a legislation for providing food security to the people.\n\nIn the last seven years, our relations with various countries of the world\nhave strengthened and deepened. It is only the result of our hard work that\ntoday we have much more self respect and self-confidence in ourselves.\n\nBrothers and sisters,\n\nThese successes are not ordinary. Today the world recognizes our\npotential to be one of the major economic powers globally. But the problem\nof corruption is a big obstacle in such a transformation.\n\nIn the last few months many instances of corruption have come to light. In\nsome cases, functionaries of the Central government face allegations of\ncorruption. In other cases, it is the functionaries of various State\ngovernments.\n\nWe are taking the strictest possible action in cases of corruption that have\nsurfaced. These cases are sub-judice and hence I will say nothing more on\nthis subject.\n\nIt is essential that when we consider these issues, we do not create an\natmosphere in which the country's progress comes into question. Any\ndebate on these matters should reflect the confidence that we can\novercome these challenges.\n\nCorruption manifests itself in many forms. In some instances, funds meant\nfor schemes for the welfare of the common man end up in the pocket of\ngovernment officials. In some other instances government discretion is\nused to favour a selected few. There are also cases where government\ncontracts are wrongfully awarded to the wrong people. We cannot let such\nactivities continue unchecked.\n\nI believe that there is no single big step which we can take to eradicate\ncorruption. In fact, we will have to act simultaneously on many fronts.\n\nWe will have to improve our justice delivery system. Everyone should know\nthat quick action will be taken against the corrupt and punishment meted\nout to them. If our system delivers justice in an effective manner,\ngovernment officials would think twice before committing a wrong act out of\ngreed or under political pressure.\n\nWe want a strong Lokpal to prevent corruption in high places. We have\nrecently introduced a Bill in Parliament to achieve this. Now only Parliament\ncan decide what type of Lokpal legislation should be enacted. I am aware\nof the differences of opinion on some aspects of the Bill. Those who don't\nagree with this Bill can put forward their views to Parliament, political\nparties and even the press. However, I also believe that they should not\nresort to hunger strikes and fasts unto death.\n\nIt is not appropriate to bring the judiciary under the ambit of Lokpal. We\nbelieve that any such provision would go against the independence of the\njudiciary. However, we do need a framework in which the judiciary\nbecomes more accountable. It is with this aim that we have introduced the\nJudicial Accountability Bill in Parliament. I am confident that this Bill will be\npassed soon.\n\nAn alert press and an aware citizenry can be very helpful in the fight\nagainst corruption. The Indian press is known for its independence and\nactivism throughout the world. The Right to Information legislation that we\nhave enacted has enabled our press and people to keep a strict watch on\nthe work of the government.\n\nToday many government decisions, which in the absence of this Act would\nescape public scrutiny, are coming to light. I believe that this is a big step\nforward in eradicating corruption.\n\nBrothers and Sisters,\n\nMany times, government discretion is misused in allocation of scarce\nresources and in the grant of clearances. We have examined this issue.\nWe will put an end to such discretionary powers wherever possible.\n\nAny government awards contracts worth thousands of crores every year.\nThere are frequent complaints of corruption in these decisions. We had\nconstituted a committee to suggest measures to reduce corruption in\ngovernment purchases. The committee has recommended that, like many\nother countries, we should also have a public procurement legislation which\nlays down the principles and practice with regard to government purchases.\nWe will introduce a Bill in Parliament by the end of this year to enact such a\nlaw.\nIn recent years, we have established independent regulatory authorities in\nmany areas. These authorities discharge many responsibilities which were\nearlier in the domain of the government itself. We have no legislation which\nwould enable monitoring of the work of these regulatory authorities and\nmake them more accountable, without, however, compromising their\nindependence. We are also considering enactment of such a law.\n\nBrothers and sisters,\n\nI have said so much on corruption because I know that this problem is a\nmatter of deep concern for all of us. However, this is a difficulty for which\nno government has a magic wand. We are taking simultaneous action on\nmany fronts in our fight against corruption. We want all political parties to\nstand shoulder to shoulder with us in this fight. To eradicate corruption, we\nhave introduced, and will introduce, many Bills in Parliament. I hope that all\npolitical parties will cooperate in the process of converting these Bills into\nstatutes. On the issue of corruption, I would like to say in the end that we\ncan win the fight against corruption only when each and every citizen of\nIndia cooperates in it.\n\nBrothers and sisters,\n\nI congratulate the country's farmers for their achievements this year. The\nproduction of foodgrains has been at a record level. Wheat, maize, pulses\nand oilseeds have all seen record levels of production. It is because of the\nhard work of our farmers that today there are proposals for export of\nfoodgrains, sugar and cotton.\n\nWe need a second Green Revolution in agriculture. We can tackle the\nproblem of rising food prices only by increasing agricultural production and\nproductivity. We also need to increase agricultural production to implement\na food security law. We will accelerate our efforts in this direction in the\n12th Plan.\n\nToday, I wish to assure our farmer brothers and sisters, particularly those\nwho are small and marginal, that we will continue to take care of their\nspecial needs. It will be our endeavour to ensure that our farmers have\neasy access to fertilizers, seeds and credit. We also want to provide the\nbest possible irrigation facilities to the farmers so that their dependence on\nrains is reduced.\n\nBrothers and sisters,\n\nOur country is passing through a phase of sustained high inflation.\nControlling rising prices is a primary responsibility of any government. Our\ngovernment fully understands this responsibility. We have continuously\ntaken steps to rein in prices. Some time we have been confronted with a\nsituation in which the reasons for rising prices lay outside the country. The\nprices of petroleum products, foodgrains and edible oil have risen steeply in\ninternational markets in recent times. Since we import these products in\nlarge quantities, any rise in their prices adds to inflationary pressure in our\ncountry. Sometimes we have been successful too in controlling inflation.\nBut this success has not proved lasting. A few days back, the people's\nconcern at rising prices was also reflected in a discussion in Parliament. I\nwish to assure you today that we are continuously monitoring the situation\nto find out what new steps can be taken to arrest rising prices. Finding a\nsolution to this problem will be our top-most priority in the coming months.\n\nBrothers and sisters,\n\nI am fully aware of the tensions caused in some parts of the country\nbecause of acquisition of land for industry, infrastructure and urbanization.\nOur farmers have been especially affected by such acquisition. Land\nacquisition is no doubt necessary for projects of public interest. But it\nshould take place in a transparent and fair manner. The interests of those\nwhose livelihoods are dependent on the land being acquired should be fully\nprotected. We will ensure that no injustice is done to anyone in the process\nof land acquisition. Our government wants to replace the 117 year old land\nacquisition law by a new Land Acquisition and Rehabilitation law which is\nforward looking and balanced. We have already prepared a draft legislation\nand have initiated steps to build consensus on it. We will soon introduce a\nBill in Parliament to this end.\n\nBrothers and sisters,\n\nWe are satisfied with our achievements in the last seven years in the areas\nof education and health. Whether it is elementary education, secondary\neducation or higher education we have taken concrete steps for\nimprovements at all levels. This has shown good results. In the last few\nyears, fundamental changes have taken place in the area of education.\nToday every citizen has a right to elementary education. We are now\nconsidering universalization of secondary education. Vocational education\nand skill development have acquired a new importance. In view of these\nmajor changes, it is necessary that we consider all aspects of education in\na comprehensive manner. Therefore we have decided to appoint an\neducation commission to make recommendations for improvements at all\nlevels of education.\n\nI have often referred to the 11th Five Year Plan as an education plan. We\nwill lay the same emphasis on health in the 12th plan as we laid on\neducation in the 11th plan. I will propose to the National Development\nCouncil that the 12th plan should be specially focused on health. I also\npromise that funds will not be a constraint in the important areas of\neducation and health.\n\nFor a long time our country had no facility for health insurance for workers\nin the unorganized sector. In 2008, we began the Rashtriya Swasthya Bima\nYojana for workers in the unorganized sector who are below the poverty\nline. In the last year we have covered those getting employment under\nMahatma Gandhi Rural Employment Act and also domestic workers, street\nvendors and beedi workers under this scheme. Today the Rashtriya\nSwasthya Bima Yojana covers about 2 crore 50 lakh workers. Our\ngovernment will endeavour to cover as many unorganized sector workers\nas possible under this scheme.\n\nBrothers and sisters,\n\nWe are continuously strengthening the physical infrastructure in our\ncountry. This is an area which requires very large investments. It is for this\nreason that in the last seven years we have pursued policies which\nencourage investment in infrastructure. As a percentage of GDP,\ninvestment in this area has grown more than one and a half times in the\nlast seven years. There have been improvements in our capacities in the\npetroleum sector and power generation, and in our airports, roads,\nespecially rural road, and ports. As an illustration, the capacity in power\ngeneration that we are going to add in the 11th plan will be twice that of the\n10th plan. In the 12th Plan, we will further accelerate investment in\ninfrastructure. We will pay special attention to the remote areas of our\ncountry and to rural areas. Connecting such areas by rail and road will get\nthe top most priority.\n\nBrothers and sisters,\n\nWe have taken a major step this year for our poor brothers and sisters\nliving in cities. Recently we have approved the Rajiv Awas Yojana. We\nwant to make India slum free through this scheme. We want the slum\ndwellers to get ownership of clean houses and have access to basic\namenities like water and electricity. We will implement the Rajiv Awas\nYojana as a national mission together with the States.\n\nBrothers and sisters,\nMalnutrition in our women and children is a matter of concern for all of us.\nWe have taken a number of steps to tackle this problem, including two new\nschemes. We have also decided that we will start implementing an\nimproved Integrated Child Development Services scheme within the next\nsix months so that the problem of malnutrition in children can be effectively\naddressed.\n\nThe figures of census 2011 show improvements in most areas. But it is a\nmatter of deep regret for us that the sex ratio has shown a decline from the\nlevel of the last census. For an improvement in this state of affairs, it is not\nonly necessary to implement the existing laws effectively but it is also\nessential to change the approach with which our society views girls and\nwomen. I would especially appeal to the State governments and social\nservice organizations to take steps for empowerment of women and for\nimproving their status in society.\n\nBrothers and sisters,\n\nLast month's terrorists attacks in Mumbai warn us that there cannot be any\nslip up in our vigilance as far as the fight against terrorism is concerned.\nThis is a long battle to be fought jointly by the Central Government, the\nState Governments and the common man. We have been steadily\nstrengthening our intelligence and security agencies and will continue to do\nso in the future also.\n\nWe are also taking all possible steps to overcome the challenge of\nnaxalism. We want to eradicate the very reasons which give rise to this\nproblem. Therefore we have started a new scheme for the accelerated\ndevelopment of 60 backward and tribal dominated districts. An amount of\nRs. 3300 crore will be spent on this scheme in a period of two years.\n\nBrothers and sisters,\nPreserving our environment even as we develop rapidly is a huge\nchallenge for us. Climate change poses a threat to both our development\nprocesses and our natural resources. We have established eight missions\non climate change and are working hard to implement these missions. We\nhave set up the National Ganga River Basin Authority for the protection and\ncleaning of river Ganga. We have also established the National Green\nTribunal for quick disposal of cases involving environmental issues. In the\ncoming months, we will constitute an environmental assessment and\nmonitoring authority to streamline the process of environmental clearances.\n\nBrothers and sisters,\n\nOur society and country are changing rapidly because of our fast economic\ngrowth. Today our people look towards the future with new hope. They\nhave higher aspirations. Our young men and women strive for path\nbreaking achievements. We should all build an environment in the country\nin which the energy and enthusiasm of the people are channelised into\nactivities of nation building. Our institutions should encourage constructive\nutilization of the potential of our people. Our entrepreneurs and\nbusinessmen should not feel constrained in their activities. Our\nindustrialists should have the opportunity to set up new industries so that\nour youth can get additional avenues for productive employment. We\nshould all stay away from politics that create suspicion or apprehension\namongst those connected with industry, business and investment.\n\nBrothers and sisters,\n\nIt is not an ordinary achievement for our democracy with a population of\n120 crore and so many religions, languages and cultures to march rapidly\nahead on the path of development. I congratulate the people of India on\nthis achievement. But we must ensure that inequalities do not increase\neven as we develop rapidly.\nWe have embarked on a journey to transform our huge and diverse country\nthrough rapid development. A development which benefits every citizen of\nthe country. It is natural that tensions would sometimes arise in this\nprocess of change. In a democracy, such tensions also become issues of\npolitical polarization. We should endeavour that even as political parties\noppose and engage in debate against each other, the pace of our progress\ndoes not get affected.\n\nWe should also have faith that our democracy, our institutions and our\nsocial ideals and values have the capacity to deal with any difficulty. We\nshould all have faith in ourselves. The faith that we can build a promising\nfuture for ourselves. The faith, that united we can do the most difficult of\ntasks. Let us all resolve to build a bright future for our country.\n\nDear Children, join me in saying\n\nJai Hind\n\nJai Hind\n\nJai Hind."},{"year":2010,"pm":"Manmohan Singh","party":"INC","footnote":"Printed from the website http://www.pmindia.nic.in","source":"PMO Archive","url":"http://archivepmo.nic.in/drmanmohansingh/content_print.php?nodeid=917&nodetype=2","text":"Dear citizens,\n\n1.    I greet you on the 63rd anniversary of our independence. When\nPandit Jawaharlal Nehru unfurled the Tricolour on this historic Red Fort, on\n15th August, 1947, he called himself the first servant of India. I address you\ntoday in the same spirit of service.\n\n2.     A few days back, many precious lives were lost in Laddakh due to a\ncloud burst. I convey my heart felt condolences to the family members and\nother near and dear ones of those who have perished. In this hour of grief,\nthe whole country stands with the people of Laddakh. It is my assurance\nthat the Central Government will do everything possible for rehabilitation of\nthe affected people.\n\n3.    When I addressed you last year on Independence Day, our country\nwas facing a number of difficulties. There was a drought like situation in\nmany parts of the country. We were also affected by the global economic\nslow down. I am happy to say that we have acquitted ourselves well in\nthese difficult circumstances. Despite many problems, the rate of our\neconomic growth has been better than most other countries in the world.\nThis shows the strength of our economy.\n\n4.    This strength has been evident not only in the last one year but also\nin our economic progress in the last many years. Today, India stands\namong the fastest growing economies of the world. As the world's largest\ndemocracy, we have become an example for many other countries to\nemulate. Our citizens have the right to make their voice heard. Our country\nis viewed with respect all over the world. Our views command attention in\ninternational fora.\n\n5.   All of you have contributed to India's success. The hard work of our\nworkers, our artisans, our farmers has brought our country to where it\nstands today. I specially salute our soldiers whose bravery ensures the\nsafety of our borders. I pay tribute to all those martyrs who have sacrificed\ntheir lives for our country.\n\n6.     We are building a new India in which every citizen would have a\nstake, an India which would be prosperous and in which all citizens would\nbe able to live a life of honour and dignity in an environment of peace and\ngoodwill. An India in which all problems could be solved through\ndemocratic means. An India in which the basic rights of every citizen would\nbe protected. In the last few years, we have taken many significant steps in\nthis direction. Every person living in rural areas now has the assurance of\n100 days of employment through the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural\nEmployment Guarantee Act. The Right to Information Act is helping our\ncitizens to become more aware. This year our Government has enacted the\nRight to Education which will help every Indian to share in the benefits of\nthe country's economic progress and also to contribute to it. To ensure\nequal partnership of women in our progress, we have taken initiative for\nreservation for women in Parliament and in State legislatures. Apart from\nthis, reservation for women has been increased to 50 per cent in local\nbodies.\n\n7.    Despite our many strengths, we face some serious challenges. We\nshould resolve today that we will meet these challenges as one people. Our\nsociety often gets divided in the name of religion, State, caste or language.\nWe should resolve that we will not allow divisions in our society under any\ncircumstance. Tolerance and generosity have been a part of our traditions.\nWe should strengthen these traditions. As we progress economically our\nsociety should also become more sensitive. We should be modern and\nprogressive in our outlook.\n\n8.    Our Government has laid special emphasis on the welfare of our\nfarmers and on increasing agricultural production. After we came to power\nin 2004, we realized that the state of Indian agriculture in the preceding 7-8\nyears was not satisfactory. Our Government increased public investment in\nagriculture. We started new schemes for increasing production. We\nencouraged agricultural planning at the district level. I am happy that the\ngrowth rate of our agriculture has increased substantially in the last few\nyears. But we are still far from achieving our goal. We need to work harder\nso that we can increase the agricultural growth rate to 4 per cent per\nannum.\n\n9.    Our Government wants a food safety net in which no citizen of ours\nwould go hungry. This requires enhanced agricultural production which is\npossible only by increasing productivity. Our country has not witnessed any\nbig technological breakthrough in agriculture after the Green Revolution.\nWe need technology which would address the needs of dry land\nagriculture. In addition, our agriculture should also be able to deal with new\nchallenges like climate change, falling levels of ground water and\ndeteriorating quality of soil. In the history of Indian agriculture, Norman\nBorlaug commands a special place. About 40 to 50 years back he\ndeveloped new and more productive seeds of wheat. Under the leadership\nof Smt. Indira Gandhiji, India achieved the Green Revolution by adopting\nthese seeds. I am happy to announce that the Borlaug Institute of South\nAsia is being established in India. This institute would facilitate availability\nof new and improved seeds and new technology to the farmers of India and\nother countries of South Asia.\n\n10. We have always taken care to provide remunerative prices to farmers\nso that they are encouraged to increase production. Support prices have\nbeen increased every year in the last six years. The support price for wheat\nwas enhanced to Rs.1,100 per quintal last year from Rs.630 per quintal in\n2003-04. In paddy, this increase was from Rs.550 per quintal to Rs.1,000\nper quintal. But one effect of providing higher prices to farmers is that food\nprices in the open market also increase.\n\n11. I know that in the last few months high inflation has caused you\ndifficulties. It is the poor who are the worst affected by rising prices,\nespecially when the prices of commodities of every day use like foodgrains,\npulses, vegetables increase. It is for this reason that we have endeavored\nto minimize the burden of increased prices on the poor. Today, I do not\nwant to go into the detailed reasons for high inflation. But, I would certainly\nlike to say that we are making every possible effort to tackle this problem. I\nam also confident that we will succeed in these efforts.\n\n12. It is obvious that any person or institution cannot spend more than his\nincome over a long period of time, even if it is the Government. It is our\nresponsibility that we manage our economy with prudence so that our\ndevelopment is not affected adversely in the future because of high debt.\nWe import about 80 per cent of our requirement of petroleum products.\nAfter 2004, we have increased the prices of petroleum products much less\ncompared to the increase in the price of crude oil in the international\nmarket. The subsidy on petroleum products has been increasing every\nyear. It had become necessary therefore to increase the prices of\npetroleum products. If this had not been done, it would not have been\npossible for our budget to bear the burden of subsidy and our programmes\nfor education, health and employment of the poor would have been\nadversely affected.\n\n13. In the 63 years after independence, India has covered a long\ndistance on the path of development. But our destination is still far away. A\nlarge part of our population still suffers from persistent poverty, hunger and\ndisease. When our Government came to power in 2004, we resolved to\nbuild a new India under a progressive social agenda. We wanted the fruits\nof development to reach the common man. We initiated programmes\nespecially targeted to the welfare of the socially and economically\nbackward sections of our society. We still stand committed to the welfare of\nthe poor, the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, minorities, women\nand other backward sections of our society. But today we do not need\nmany new programmes to achieve our goals. However, we do need to\nimplement the schemes we have already started more effectively,\nminimizing the chances of corruption and misuse of public money. We want\nto achieve this in partnership with the State Governments, Panchayat Raj\nInstitutions and civil society groups.\n\n14. Secularism is one of the pillars of our democracy. It has been the\ntradition of our country and society to treat all religions with equal respect.\nFor centuries India has welcomed new religions and all have flourished\nhere. Secularism is also our constitutional obligation. Our Government is\ncommitted to maintain communal peace and harmony. We also consider it\nour duty to protect the minorities and provide for their special needs. This is\nwhy we have started many new programmes in the last four years for the\nwelfare of our brothers and sisters belonging to the minority communities.\nThese include scholarships for minority students and special programmes\nfor the development of districts which have a high concentration of\nminorities. These schemes have shown good results. We will vigorously\ntake this work forward.\n\n15. We have been giving special attention to education and health in the\nlast six years. Improvement in these two areas is an important component\nof our strategy for inclusive growth. It is also necessary for higher economic\ngrowth in the years to come. After independence, these two areas could\nnot get the importance they deserved. We tried to change this state of\naffairs in the 11th Plan. Today, almost every child in our country has\naccess to primary education. Now, we need to pay more attention to\nsecondary and higher education. We also need to improve the quality of\neducation at all levels. It is our endeavour that every child, irrespective of\nwhether he is rich or poor and which section of the society he belongs to,\nshould be given an education that enables him to realize his potential and\nmakes him a responsible citizen of our country. We will continue to\nimplement the new schemes that we have started in the last six years in\nthe areas of education and health with sincerity and hard work and in\npartnership with the State Governments. We will soon bring a Bill to\nParliament for constitution of two separate councils in higher education and\nhealth respectively so that reforms in these two areas can be accelerated.\n\n16. Nutritious food and good health services are necessary but not\nenough for ensuring good health of our citizens. We also need cleanliness\nand good sanitation in our villages, towns and cities. There are many\ndiseases which would be difficult to prevent otherwise. The truth is that our\ncountry lags behind in this area. I consider it a primary responsibility of all\nour citizens to maintain cleanliness and hygiene around them. I would like\nour children to be taught the importance of cleanliness and hygiene in\nschools from the very beginning under a campaign for a Clean India. I\nappeal to the State Governments, Panchayat Raj Institutions, civil society\ngroups and common citizens to make this campaign successful.\n\n17. Mahatma Gandhi had said that our earth has enough for everyone's\nneed but not for everyone's greed. Imprudent use of the earth's natural\nresources has resulted in the problem of climate change. We need to use\nour natural resources with care and prudence. It is our responsibility\ntowards the coming generations to protect and preserve our forests, rivers\nand mountains. Our government will endeavour to take care of\nenvironmental concerns in our projects for economic development.\n\n18. There is a large deficit in our physical infrastructure which affects our\neconomic development adversely. There is a shortfall in the supply of\nelectricity to industries. Our roads, ports and airports are not of world\nstandards. We have been trying to increase electricity production and\nimprove our roads, ports and airports. The resources required to create\ngood physical infrastructure are difficult for the Government alone to\nmobilize. Therefore, we have endeavoured to involve the private sector in\nour efforts. The steps that we have taken after 2004 to improve our\nphysical infrastructure have started bearing fruit now. About one and half a\nmonths back, I dedicated a new terminal of the Delhi airport to the nation.\nThis is an excellent terminal which has been completed in record time. We\nwill continue to make such efforts to improve our physical infrastructure.\n19. There has been much discussion recently on the issue of internal\nsecurity. If law and order in any part of India deteriorates or peace and\nharmony gets disturbed, the common man is adversely affected. Therefore,\nit is one of the primary responsibilities of any government to maintain law\nand order so that the citizens can live and earn their livelihood in an\natmosphere of peace and harmony. Naxalism is a serious challenge to our\ninternal security. I pay tribute to the men and officers of our security forces\nwho have became martyrs in the attacks by naxalites in the last few\nmonths. I have stated this before and I say it again - our Government will\nfully discharge its responsibility to protect each and every citizen of our\ncountry. We will deal firmly with those who resort to violence. We will\nprovide all possible help to State Governments to maintain the rule of law in\nareas affected by naxalism. I once again appeal to naxalites to abjure\nviolence, come for talks with the Government and join hands with us to\naccelerate social and economic development. A few days back I took a\nmeeting with the Chief Ministers of States affected by naxalism. We will\nfully implement the consensus that emerged in that meeting. I would like to\nrepeat here a point that I made in that meeting. It is imperative that Centre\nand States work together to meet the challenge of naxalism. It would be\nvery difficult for any State to tackle this problem without cooperation from\nthe Centre and coordination between States. We all need to rise above our\npersonal and political interests to meet this challenge.\n\n20. As I have stated earlier, most naxalite affected areas lag behind in\ndevelopment. Many such areas also have a large concentration of our\nadivasi brothers and sisters. We want to end the neglect of these areas. I\nhave asked the Planning Commission to formulate a comprehensive\nscheme towards this end, which we would implement fully. It is also our\nendeavour that our adivasi brothers and sisters join the mainstream of\ndevelopment. They have been dependent on forest produce for centuries\nand this dependence should not end without the creation of new sources of\nlivelihood. Apart from adequate compensation for land which is acquired\nfrom them, we should also ensure that our adivasi brothers and sisters\nhave a stake in the developmental project being undertaken.\n\n21. I would like to state one more thing in this context. It is very\nnecessary to make the administrative machinery more sensitive in areas\naffected by naxalism. The government officials who work there should not\nonly be sincere but should also be alive to the special needs of our adivasi\nbrothers and sisters. It is my hope that the State Governments will pay\nadequate attention to these requirements.\n\n22. We have a special responsibility towards the States of the North East.\nWe are trying to live up to that responsibility. The North Eastern part of our\ncountry has been witness to some unpleasant incidents in the recent\nmonths. I would like to convey to all political parties and groups of the North\nEast that disputes in the name of State or tribe can only harm all of us.\nDiscussion and dialogue are the only options to resolve complex issues. As\nfar as the Central Government is concerned, we are ready to take forward\nevery process of talks which could lead to progress in resolution of\nproblems.\n\n23. In Jammu and Kashmir, we are ready to talk to every person or group\nwhich abjures violence. Kashmir is an integral part of India. Within this\nframework, we are ready to move forward in any talks which would\nincrease the partnership of the common man in governance and also\nenhance their welfare. Recently, some young men have lost their lives in\nviolence in Jammu and Kashmir. We deeply regret this. The years of\nviolence should now end. Such violence would not benefit anyone. I believe\nthat India's democracy has the generosity and flexibility to be able to\naddress the concerns of any area or group in the country. I recently\nparticipated in a meeting with political parties from Jammu and Kashmir.\nWe will endeavour to take this process forward. I would like to convey to\nour countrymen, especially our citizens in Jammu and Kashmir and in the\nNorth East, that they should adopt democratic means to join hands with us\nfor their and country's welfare.\n\n24. We want prosperity, peace and harmony in our neighbouring\ncountries. Whatever differences we have with our neighbouring countries,\nwe want to resolve them through discussions. As far as Pakistan is\nconcerned, we expect from them that they would not let their territory be\nused for acts of terrorism against India. We have been emphasizing this in\nall our discussions with the Pakistan Government. If this is not done, we\ncannot progress far in our dialogue with Pakistan.\n\n25. I would also like to say something which is related to our glorious\ncultural traditions. The use of harsh and unpleasant words in our political\ndiscourse has increased in recent days. This is against our traditions of\ngenerosity, humility and tolerance. Criticism has a place of its own in a\ndemocracy and in a progressive society. However, criticism should not be\nundignified. We should have the capacity to reconcile opposite points of\nview on important issues through debate and discussion. I would request\nall political parties to consider this issue.\n\n26. The Commonwealth Games will start in Delhi after about one and a\nhalf months. This will be a proud moment for the whole country and\nespecially for Delhi. I am convinced that all our countrymen will treat the\nGames as a national festival and will leave no stone unturned to make\nthem a success. The successful organization of Commonwealth Games\nwould be another signal to the world that India is rapidly marching ahead\nwith confidence.\n\n27. Our future is bright. The day when our dreams will come true is not\nfar off. Let us all resolve on this anniversary of our independence that we\nwill keep the flag of our nation flying high. Let us march ahead together on\nthe path of progress and prosperity.\n\n28.

It will be our\nendeavour to carry everyone with us and to lead the country ahead on the\npath of development by creating an environment of consensus and\ncooperation.\n\nWe know that India's progress can be real only when every citizen of our\ncountry benefits from it. Every Indian has a right over our national\nresources. The policies and schemes of our Government in the last 5 years\nhave been based on this paradigm. It has been our endeavour to ensure\nthat the benefit of development reaches all sections of the society and all\nregions and citizens of the country. Our efforts have succeeded to some\nextent. But our work is still incomplete. We will carry it forward with firm\ndetermination and sincerity.\n\nAs you know, our economy grew at a rate of about 9% from the year\n2004-05 to the year 2007-08. This growth rate came down to 6.7% in\n2008-09 due to the global economic crisis. It is only a result of our policies\nthat the global crisis has affected us to a lesser extent than many other\ncountries. Restoring our growth rate to 9% is the greatest challenge we\nface. We will make every necessary effort to meet this challenge -- whether\nit is for increasing capital flows into the country, or for encouraging exports\nor for increasing public investment and expenditure. We expect that there\nwill be an improvement in the situation by the end of this year, but till that\ntime we will all have to bear with the fall out of the global economic slow\ndown. I appeal to all businessmen and industrialists to join us in our effort\nto tackle this difficult situation and to fulfill their social obligations fully.\n\nI have always believed that India's prosperity is not possible without the\nprosperity of our farmers. This is the reason why our Government had\nwaived bank loans of lakhs of farmers. We have increased the support\nprices for agricultural products by far more than ever before. This year\nthere has been deficiency in the monsoons. This would definitely have\nsome adverse impact on our crops. But, I am sure we will be able to meet\nthe situation quite well. We will provide all possible assistance to our\nfarmers to deal with the drought. In view of the deficiency in the monsoons,\nwe have postponed the date for repayment of bank loans of our farmers.\nWe are also giving additional support to farmers for payment of interest on\nshort term crop loans.\n\nWe have adequate stocks of foodgrains. All efforts will be made to control\nthe rising prices of foodgrains, pulses and other goods of daily use. I\nappeal to all State governments to exercise their statutory powers to\nprevent hoarding and black marketing of essential commodities.\n\nWe will have to adopt modern means to be successful in agriculture. We\nwill have to make more efficient use of our scarce land and water\nresources. Our scientists must devise new techniques to increase the\nproductivity of our small and marginal farmers. More attention will have to\nbe paid to the needs of those farmers who do not have means for irrigation.\nThe country needs another Green Revolution and we will try our best to\nmake it possible. Our goal is 4% annual growth in agriculture and I am\nconfident that we will be able to achieve this target in the next 5 years.\n\nIt is our ardent desire that not even a single citizen of India should ever go\nhungry. This is the reason why we have promised a food security law under\nwhich every family living below the poverty line will get a fixed amount of\nfoodgrains every month at concessional rates. It is also our national resolve\nto root out malnutrition from our country. In this effort, special care will be\ntaken of the needs of women and children. We will endeavour to extend the\nbenefit of ICDS to every child below the age of six years in the country by\nMarch 2012.\nThe first UPA government had given the right to 100 days of employment in\na year to every rural family through the National Rural Employment\nGuarantee Act. In the last 4 years, this programme has been expanded to\ncover the whole country. The programme has been able to fulfil the\nexpectations from it to a large extent. In the year 2008-09, it benefited\nabout 4 crore families. It has also contributed to improvement in rural\ninfrastructure. In the coming days we will improve the programme to bring\nmore transparency and accountability into it. New types of works will be\nadded to the works that can be taken up under the programme.\n\nWe know that good education is not only desirable in itself but is also\nessential for the empowerment of our people. We have recently enacted\nthe Right to Education Act. This law provides to each child of our country\nthe right to elementary education. I wish to make it clear that funds will not\nbe a constraint as far as education is concerned. We will give special\nattention to the needs of disabled children. As a result of our efforts in the\nlast few years, almost every child in our country has access to primary\neducation today. Now we also need to pay greater attention to secondary\neducation. Secondary education will be expanded through a programme\nthat will ensure that every child in the country gets its benefit. We will\nendeavour to provide bank loans and scholarships to the maximum\npossible number of students to support their education.\n\nA new scheme will be started to help students from economically weaker\nsections of society by way of reduced interest rate on their education loans.\nThis will benefit about 5 lakh students in getting technical and professional\neducation.\n\nGood health is one of our basic needs. The National Rural Health Mission\nthat we have started aims at strengthening the infrastructure for rural public\nhealth services. We will expand the Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana so as\nto cover each family below the poverty line. In our journey on the road of\ndevelopment we will pay special attention to the needs of our differently\nabled brothers and sisters. We will increase facilities available for them.\n\nWhile touching upon issues related to health, I would also like to make a\nmention of the flu that is spreading due to the H1N1 virus. As you all know,\nsome parts of our country have been affected by this illness. The Central\nGovernment and the State Governments will together continue to make all\nnecessary efforts to control the spread of this infection. I also want to\nassure you that the situation does not warrant a disruption of our daily lives\nbecause of fear and anxiety.\n\nThe special programmes that our government had started for the\ndevelopment of rural and urban areas will be accelerated. We have been\nsuccessful to some extent in improving the infrastructure in rural areas\nthrough Bharat Nirman. But there is still a wide disparity between the\ndevelopment of rural and urban areas. To this end, the allocations under\nBharat Nirman have been increased substantially this year. We will set\nmore ambitious targets for schemes for house construction and\ntelecommunications in rural areas.\n\nWe will accelerate our efforts to improve physical infrastructure in the\ncountry. The Road Transport and National Highways Department has\ninitiated action for construction of 20 Km of National Highways every day.\nSimilarly, Railways have started work on the Dedicated Freight Corridors.\nWe are giving careful attention to the problems of Air India and will resolve\nthem soon. The schemes of roads, railways and civil aviation being\nimplemented in Jammu & Kashmir and the States of the North East will be\nespecially monitored.\n\nWe had started the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission for\nthe urban areas. We will accelerate this programme also. Today, lakhs of\nour citizens live in slums which lack basic amenities. We wish to make our\ncountry slum free as early as possible. In the next five years, we will\nprovide better housing facilities to slum dwellers through a new scheme,\nRajiv Awas Yojana.\n\nClimate change has become an issue of global concern in recent years. If\nwe don't take the necessary steps in time, our glaciers will melt and our\nrivers will go dry. The problems of droughts and floods will grow in\nseriousness. We also need to prevent air pollution. India wishes to tackle\nthe problem of climate change in partnership with other countries of the\nworld. We have taken a decision to constitute 8 National Missions. We are\ncommitted to meet the challenge of climate change through these 8\nMissions. To increase the use of solar energy and to make it affordable, we\nwill launch the Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission on 14th November\nof this year.\n\nThe sacred Ganga is the life source for crores of Indians. It is our duty to\nkeep the river clean. We have constituted the National Ganga Authority in\nwhich the Central and State Governments will jointly work towards this end.\nThe cooperation of the public is also needed in this effort.\n\nOur natural resources are limited. We must use them more efficiently. We\nneed a new culture of energy conservation. We also need to prevent the\nmisuse of water. We will pay more attention to programmes for water\ncollection and storage. \"Save Water\" should be one of our national slogans.\n\nIf we work united, we can meet all challenges that confront us. Our citizens\nhave the right to express dissent and anger. I also maintain that every\ngovernment should be sensitive to people's complaints and dissatisfaction.\nBut nothing is achieved by destroying public property and indulging in\nviolence against one's fellow citizens. Our democracy has no place for\nthose who resort to violence to express their disagreement, and the\ngovernment will deal firmly with such people.\n\nTerrorism has emerged as a threat to peace and harmony in all parts of the\nworld. After the horrific terror attacks in Mumbai in last November, our\ngovernment has taken many steps against terrorism. To root out terrorist\nactivities, our security forces and intelligence agencies are being constantly\nupgraded. I am sure that with cooperation from all sections of our society,\nwe will be successful in eliminating terrorism from our country.\n\nSome parts of our country continue to be affected by the Naxalite menace.\nIt is the constitutional obligation of the government to protect the life and\nliberty of our citizens. Those who think that they can seize power by\nrecourse to the gun do not understand the strength of our democracy. The\nCentral Government will redouble its efforts to deal with Naxalite activities.\nWe will extend all help to the State Governments to make their police\nforces more effective. Central forces will be provided wherever they are\nneeded. We will also do more to ensure better coordination among States.\n\nI would also like to state here that we will endeavour to remove those\ncauses of social and economic dissatisfaction which give rise to problems\nlike Naxalism. We believe in a development process which will remove\nbackwardness, unemployment and reduce disparities in income and\nwealth. We seek active partnership of our brothers and sisters of\nScheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in our development processes.\n\nWe do not subscribe to the view that to take special care of the deprived\nsections of the society amounts to appeasement. In fact, we believe that it\nis our solemn duty to do so. Our government will give its full attention to the\nwell being of our brothers and sisters belonging to the minority\ncommunities. We have started many schemes for the welfare of the\nminorities. These programmes will be taken forward. The funds for the\nspecial schemes taken up for the development of minority concentration\ndistricts have been enhanced quite substantially this year. Similarly, we\nhave allocated increased funds for scholarship schemes for minorities that\nthe first UPA government had started. A Bill to prevent communal violence\nhas been introduced in Parliament and efforts will be made to convert it into\na law as soon as possible.\n\nThe practice of female foeticide regrettably persists in our society. This is a\nshame for all of us. We must eliminate it as early as possible. Our progress\nwill be incomplete till women become equal partners in all areas of our life\nand in our nation's progress. Our government is committed to the early\npassage of the Women's Reservation Bill. This legislation will provide\none-third reservation for women in Parliament and the State Assemblies.\nWe are also working on a legislation to provide 50% reservation for women\nin rural and urban local bodies. In fact, we should find ways and means to\nincrease the participation of women in all democratic institutions. Our\ngovernment will make sustained efforts for social and economic\nempowerment of women. We have decided to launch a National Female\nLiteracy Mission, through which female illiteracy will be reduced by half in\nthe next three years.\n\nWe are proud of our brave soldiers. It is our duty to ensure that\nex-servicemen are able to lead a life of comfort. We have accepted the\nrecommendations of the committee constituted to examine the issue of\npension of ex-servicemen. This will lead to increased pension for about 12\nlakh retired jawans and Junior Commissioned Officers.\n\nIn our journey of development, we should not only pay special attention to\nsome sections of our society, but must also take care of the special needs\nof the backward regions of our country. We will redouble our efforts to\nremove regional imbalances in the level of development. Here I would like\nto make a special mention of our States of the North-East. Our government\nwill constantly endeavour to make the States of the North East equal\npartners in the country's progress. Imphal or Kohima may be physically far\naway from Delhi, but the welfare of our brothers and sisters of the North\nEast is always close to our heart. We know that without their well-being the\ncountry cannot move forward.\nThere have been two elections in Jammu & Kashmir since I addressed you\non the last Independence Day. The first one was for the State Legislative\nAssembly and the second for the Lok Sabha. People of all areas of the\nState have participated vigorously in both the elections. This is a proof that\nthere is no place for separatist thought in Jammu & Kashmir.\n\nOur Government will continue assisting the State Government in improving\ngovernance in all parts of Jammu & Kashmir. It will be our endeavour to\nensure that human rights are respected in the State and all its citizens are\nable to lead a life of peace and dignity in an environment of safety and\nsecurity. We respect the special assurances and concessions provided to\nJammu & Kashmir in our Constitution. We will continue to honour these\nspecial provisions.\n\nToday's world is becoming smaller in many respects. Whether it is the\ninternational economic crisis or terrorism or climate change - what happens\nin one part of the world has an effect on other parts also. The international\neconomic and political order is changing. Questions are being raised on the\nfunctioning and continued effectiveness of the multilateral institutions\nestablished in the 20th Century.\n\nOur foreign policy should be able to cater to India's interests in these\nconstantly changing circumstances. I am happy that we have been\nsuccessful in doing this to a large extent.\n\nWe have good relations with the United States, Russia, China, Japan and\nEurope. There is a tremendous amount of goodwill for India and its people\nin the countries of South East Asia, Central Asia, West Asia and the Gulf.\nWe have further strengthened our traditional ties with Africa. We are\nlooking for new opportunities in Latin America.\n\nAs far our neighbours are concerned, we want to live with them in peace\nand harmony. We will make every possible effort to create an environment\nconducive to the social and economic development of the whole of South\nAsia.\n\nHowever good our programmes and schemes might be, their benefit will\nnot reach the public till the government machinery is not free of corruption\nand till it is not effective in their implementation. I would like our public\nadministration to be more efficient so that programmes for public good can\nbe implemented faster. We need to improve our delivery systems to\nprovide basic services to our citizens. We will act with speed on the\nrecommendations of the Administrative Reforms Commission to strengthen\ngovernance. Renewed efforts will be made to decentralize public\nadministration through the Panchayati Raj Institutions and to ensure\ngreater involvement of people in it. Initiative will be taken for a new\npartnership between the civil society and the government so that taxpayers'\nmoney is better spent. We have enacted the Right to Information Act to\nenhance accountability and transparency in public life. This law will be\nimproved so that it is more effective.\n\nWe have to make special efforts to strengthen the administrative machinery\nfor our rural programmes. Those who live in villages and semi-urban areas\nshould get services similar to the residents of urban areas. Communication\nand Information Technology can go a long way in achieving this objective.\nRecently, we have set up the Unique Identification Authority of India. This is\na historic step to link up the whole country through a high quality\nadministrative arrangement. We expect the first set of identity numbers to\nbe available in the next one to one and a half years.\n\nToday, as I stand before you I can feel the energy of more than 100 crore\nIndians marching ahead on the path of progress. Some people question\nwhether India will ever be able to attain its true potential. I have no doubt\nabout this. We are rapidly moving forward. We have faith in ourselves. We\nhave political stability. Our democracy is an example for the whole world.\nWe are gaining in economic strength. And most importantly, we have full\nconfidence in our youth. They are our future. I am sure that they will take\nour country to a new glory.\n\nLet us all commit ourselves today to working for a golden future. On this\nsacred occasion let us resolve that nation building will be our highest duty.\n\nJai Hind\n\nJai Hind\n\nJai Hind."},{"year":2008,"pm":"Manmohan Singh","party":"INC","footnote":"Printed from the website http://www.pmindia.nic.in","source":"PMO Archive","url":"http://archivepmo.nic.in/drmanmohansingh/content_print.php?nodeid=677&nodetype=2","text":"My dear countrymen, brothers, sisters and my dear children\n\nGreetings to all of you on this happy occasion of our Independence Day.\nThis is a sacred day for every Indian. Today we remember the sacrifice of\nthose who under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi fought for our freedom\nfrom foreign rule. Today we remember the hard work and dedication of all\nthose who have toiled to build a free and modern India. And we re-dedicate\nourselves to that cause. We remember our farmers, our workers and our\nteachers. We remember our soldiers - who defend our borders in snowy\nmountains, in deserts, in jungles, on the shores and in the oceans.\n\nBrothers and Sisters,\n\nFour years ago, on this day, I stood here before you and spoke to you\nabout our Government's new vision for a new India. I said to you that it is\nour desire to build an India that is just and humane; an India that treats all\nits citizens as equals;\n\nan India that is prosperous; an India that lives in peace; an India in which\neveryone can find work suited to his or her talent and can work for his or\nher brighter future. An India that is secular, that is fair and just to all its\npeople. An India united in its diversity. It has been our sincere endeavour to\nwork for the building of such an India.\n\nBrothers and Sisters,\n\nFour years ago I stood here and said to you that I have no promises to\nmake, but I have promises to keep. The implementation of the National\nCommon Minimum Programme, was our promise to keep;\n\nTo give a \"new deal to rural India\", was our promise to keep;\n\nTo make our economy and society inclusive was our promise to keep;\nTo take India to its rightful place in the comity of nations, was our promise\nto keep;\n\nIt has been the sincere endeavour of our Government to keep each of\nthese promises. We have given a new deal to rural India. Through the\nRashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana we are investing Rs. 25000 crore in\nagriculture; To provide relief to our debt distressed farmers we have waived\nloans taken from the banks amounting to about Rs. 71000 crore; In the\npast four years we have increased bank credit for agricultural sector from\nRs 81000 crore to Rs 225000 crore, and have reduced the interest rates for\nfarm loans; In order to improve the economic conditions of farmers we have\nsteeply increased the procurement prices for food grains; 50% for wheat\nand 30% for paddy; The National Food Security Mission has been set up to\nenhance production of rice, wheat and pulses; Irrigation, watershed\ndevelopment, rainfed areas development, and flood management have\nreceived our special attention; Our effort at increasing investment in rural\nareas and reducing the debt burden of farmers has turned our agricultural\neconomy around.\n\nAfter almost a decade of stagnation especially from 1998 to 2004,\ninvestment in agriculture is increasing and there has been a revival in this\narea. We have had record production of foodgrains, cotton and sugar in\n2007-08. Our farms are once again green. Our godowns are once again\nfilling up. Our farmers are once again hopeful about their future and their\nwelfare.\n\nBrothers and Sisters,\n\nI spent the first ten years of my life in a village that had no electricity, no\ndrinking water supply, no doctor, no roads and no phones. I had to walk\nmany miles to a school. I had to study at night in the dim light of a kerosene\nlamp. After independence there has been considerable development in\nrural areas, yet many of our citizens still live a life that I lived in my\nchildhood.\n\nThat is why when our Government took over, we launched Bharat Nirman,\nto build rural infrastructure. Our Government is committed to transforming\nrural India. In these four years we have taken important initiatives. I am\nconfident that a new and prosperous India will be built due to our efforts.\n\nMy dear Countrymen,\n\nFour years ago I spoke to you about our \"Seven Sutras\" - the seven\npriorities for our Government - agriculture, water, education, health care,\nemployment, urban renewal and infrastructure.\n\nIn each area we have taken important initiatives. I have already spoken\nabout our initiatives for agricultural development and farmer's welfare.\n\nThe second important area of development has been infrastructure\ndevelopment. There is a new dynamism in our railways. New roads are\nbeing built. New seaports and airports are being developed. More and\nmore of our people now live in our cities. The Jawaharlal Nehru National\nUrban Mission has been funding urban development and modernization of\nour cities. The National Rural Health Mission has been expanding public\nhealth facilities and services in rural areas.\n\nAs someone who started his professional life as a teacher, I feel proud to\nsay that our Government has been giving special attention to the\ndevelopment of education in our country. There is a massive increase in\npublic investment in education at all levels. In elementary education, in\nsecondary education and in higher education.\n\nWe have strengthened Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan and expanded the mid-day\nmeal programme upto upper primary level in all districts of the country.\nAbout 14 crore children are being provided mid-day meals under this\nscheme. We are establishing 6000 new high quality model schools, with at\nleast one school in each block. 373 new colleges are being opened in\nbackward districts. We are opening 30 new universities, 8 new IITs, 7 new\nIIMs, 20 new IIITs, 5 new Indian Institutes of Science, 2 Schools of\nPlanning and Architecture, 10 NITs, and a 1000 new polytechnics.\n\nI have called the 11th Five Year Plan our \"National Education Plan\". We\nwant every section of our society to get access to education. Every child\nbelonging to a family of SC, ST, OBC and all Minorities, every single child,\nboy or girl, must have access to modern education. Our Government is\nimplementing several new scholarship schemes for the educational\ndevelopment of our children. Schemes for pre-matric and post-matric\nscholarships for children hailing from SC, ST, OBC and Minority families\nare being implemented. Special scholarships for meritorious students from\nSC, ST, OBC and Minority families have also been launched. Scholarships\nfor overseas studies are being given to SC and ST students. National\nmerit-cum-means scholarships for children hailing from economically\nweakers sections and children with disabilities have also been approved.\n\nWe have established a new Skill Development Mission which will work\nunder the supervision of the Prime Minister. A Skill Development\nCorporation will be created by the Government with the active participation\nof the private sector to give special training to our young men and women,\nour workers and our technicians.\n\nI am happy to say that we are sincerely implementing most of the\nrecommendations of the Justice Sachar Committee Report on social,\neconomic and educational empowerment of our Muslim community.\n\nIndia will be transformed only when every Indian is literate, well fed, healthy\nand can secure gainful employment. I want to see a modern India, imbued\nby a scientific temper, where the benefits of modern knowledge flow to all\nsections of society. This year we hope to send an Indian spacecraft,\nChandrayan, to the moon. It will be an important milestone in the\ndevelopment of our space programme.\n\nBrothers and Sisters,\n\nProviding employment has been a special priority for us. Our policies for\nagriculture, for industry, for infrastructure development and for skill\ndevelopment, will all promote employment. Our beloved former Prime\nMinister Shrimati Indira Gandhi had said, \"Garibi Hatao\". Our leader\nShrimati Sonia Gandhi has given us the slogan, \"Rozgar Badhao\". Our\nGovernment is making special efforts to create \"rozgar\" to fight \"garibi\".\n\nThe National Rural Employment Guarantee Programme is a historic\ninitiative of our Government. Today the entire country is covered by this\nprogramme. The NREGA is providing minimum livelihood support to the\ncrores of neediest among us. It is aimed to soften the sharp edges of\npoverty. To create more employment we need more investment in\nagriculture, in manufacturing and in infrastructure. We need a new wave of\nindustrialization to generate more employment. If industrial development\nhas any adverse impact on some of our rural folk, we will ensure that there\nis reasonable compensation and proper rehabilitation. A new Rehabilitation\nand Resettlement Policy has been formulated and we will seek\nParliament's approval for it.\n\nWe have introduced a bill in Parliament to provide social security to the\nworkers of the unorganized sector. Our Government has launched the Aam\nAadmi Beema Yojana, under which one member of each landless family in\nrural areas will be insured. We have also started a programme to provide\nhealth insurance to Below Poverty Line families of workers in the\nunorganized sector. Citizens above 65 years of age, living below the\npoverty line are being covered under the Indira Gandhi Pension Scheme.\nMy dear countrymen,\n\nIn the past four years we have seen a sharp increase in the rate of\ninvestment. This has contributed to an increase in the rate of growth of the\neconomy. For the first time in history, we have had four years of nearly\n9.0% economic growth. India is among the world's fastest growing\neconomies.\n\nBut there are new challenges that we face. We have the challenge of\ninflation. I know how much each one of you is concerned about the recent\nrise in prices. The inflation we have seen this year is basically due to\nexternal factors. All over the world and in global markets the price of food,\nfuel and other commodities has been rising. In many developing countries\nthe rate of inflation is double that in India. Our Government has worked\nhard to ensure that in India the rate of inflation is not as high as in many\nother countries. We have also taken special measures to insulate the\npoorer sections of our society from the full impact of rising food and fuel\nprices. Our Government has not raised the price of kerosene and fertilizers.\nWe have not raised the issue price of wheat and rice under PDS.\n\nWe are taking determined measures to bring prices under reasonable\ncontrol. I have urged all Chief Ministers to improve and strengthen the PDS\nto ensure availability of essential commodities to the common man at\nreasonable prices. The Reserve Bank of India is moderating the growth of\nmoney supply in the country so that inflation can be controlled. However,\nwhile making these efforts we should avoid doing anything which hurts our\ngrowth.\n\nBrothers and Sisters,\n\nToday, while speaking about the achievements of our Government, I wish\nto make one more promise. We have done much, but I realize that there is\nmore to do. The problem of malnutrition is a curse that we must remove.\nOur efforts to provide every child with access to education and to improve\nhealth care services for all citizens will continue. We need to take forward\nour initiatives for giving equal status to women and for their social and\neconomic empowerment. I promise to you that we will continue striving for\nthe development and prosperity of our country. We will work hard to take\nthe country to greater heights in all fields.\n\nBrothers and Sisters,\n\nWe must apply modern science and technology to find long term solutions\nto our energy problem. Our crude oil and gas reserves are limited. We must\nfind alternative energy sources. I would like our scientists and engineers to\nfind ways in which we can make better use of solar energy, wind energy,\nbio-gas and other sources of energy.\n\nOur economy must grow at the rate of at least ten per cent every year to\nget rid of poverty and generate employment for all. A basic requirement for\nsustained growth, and for the development of our agriculture and industry is\navailability of energy, particularly electricity. All over the world, there is\ngrowing realization of the importance of atomic energy to meet the\nchallenge of energy security and climate change. It is a clean,\nenvironmental friendly and renewable source of energy.\n\nIndia's atomic scientists and technologists are world class. They have\ndeveloped nuclear energy capacities despite heavy odds. But there are\nhandicaps which have adversely affected our atomic energy programme.\nWe have inadequate production of uranium. The quality of our uranium\nresources is not comparable to those of other producers. Many countries\nhave imposed sanctions on trade with India in nuclear materials, nuclear\nequipment and nuclear technology. As a result, our nuclear energy\nprogramme has suffered.\n\nThe nuclear agreement that we are negotiating with developed countries\nwill end India's nuclear isolation. It will open up new opportunities for trade\nin dual-use high technologies and nuclear materials and equipment,\nopening up new pathways to accelerate industrialization of our country. It\nwill enable us to provide electricity to meet the needs of our farmers, our\nartisans, our traders and our industry.\n\nBrothers and Sisters,\n\nFour years ago I said to you that an important challenge we face is the\nchallenge of providing good governance. We have taken several steps to\nmake Government transparent, efficient and responsive. The Right to\nInformation Act was one major step. We have initiated reform and\nmodernization of Government. The National e-Governance Plan will make\nit easier for all our citizens to deal with the various agencies of\nGovernment.\n\nWe have completed the examination of the report of the Sixth Pay\nCommission. We have gone beyond the recommendations of the\nCommission in increasing emoluments of government employees. While\ndoing this we have taken special care of the interests and welfare of our\narmed forces and para-military forces, and government employees working\nat lower levels in our civil services. This is one more step in making\nGovernment more efficient.\n\nWe need more reforms at all levels of Government. We want to improve\nour schools, our hospitals and other public services. The Panchayati Raj\nInstitutions have an important role to play in decentralization and reform of\nGovernment. We must enhance their administrative and financial powers. I\nappeal to State Governments to take all possible steps for improving\ngovernance and to help in the Central Government's initiatives.\n\nMy dear Countrymen,\nTerrorism, extremism, communalism and fundamentalism have emerged\nas major challenges to the unity and integrity of our country. The recent\nterrorist attacks in Bangalore, Ahmedabad, Jaipur and other parts of the\ncountry have shocked the nation. What words can I find to condemn such\nacts of barbarism. I share the sorrow and grief of people affected by\nterrorism. The Government of India will take concrete steps to rehabilitate\nand help such families.\n\nI commend our security forces and intelligence agencies for the dedication\nwith which they are dealing with the problem under difficult circumstances.\nBut I agree that we have to further strengthen our intelligence agencies and\npolice forces to deal with the problem of terrorism.\n\nWe will examine the functioning of our intelligence agencies and police and\nsecurity forces and take all possible steps to equip them to tackle this\nchallenge. Whatever resources are required, will be provided. Whatever\nmanpower is required will be provided. We are firm in our resolve to meet\nthe challenge of terrorism. I urge the State Governments, all political\nparties, civil society groups and social and religious leaders to cooperate\nwith us in rooting out terrorism from our country.\n\nBrothers and Sisters,\n\nI am confident that we will overcome these challenges. But this requires\nhard work and unity of purpose. This requires a politics of consensus, not\nconfrontation. This requires dialogue among communities, not discord. The\nchallenge of communalism, of extremism and of terrorism cannot be won\nby a nation divided. The challenge of environmental and ecological\ndestruction cannot be won by a society divided.\n\nThe challenge of economic modernization and social development of all, of\nScheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, of Other Backward Classes and\nMinorities, cannot be won by a people divided.\nBrothers and Sisters,\n\nI have said on a number of occasions that I am greatly concerned about the\nproblem of regional imbalances in development. Some parts of our country\nare doing much better than others. Some States are being left behind. This\npattern has persisted for far too long. We must ensure that the less\ndeveloped States catch up with the developed ones.\n\nWe must pay special attention to the development of the North-Eastern\nregion. Our Government has taken several initiatives to increase public\ninvestment in the North-East and in Jammu & Kashmir. We are investing in\ninfrastructure and in education in these regions to encourage development\nand generate employment.\n\nJammu & Kashmir and the North-eastern region require an era of peace for\nthem to catch up with the more developed parts of the country. We have\nbeen taking various initiatives to promote peace and stability in these\nStates. These initiatives will be taken forward.\n\nThe recent incidents in the State of Jammu and Kashmir are a cause for\nconcern. In this hour of crisis, divisive politics will lead us nowhere. I appeal\nto all political parties to keep the long term interests of Jammu and Kashmir\nin view and come together to find a permanent solution to the problems of\nthe State.\n\nThe sacred shrine of Shri Amar Nath inspires all Indians to march together.\nThis shrine is a shining example of our secular tradition, where Hindu\npilgrims have been looked after for years by their Muslim brothers. Issues\nrelated to this sacred place, especially the issue of providing the best\npossible facilities to pilgrims, can only be resolved in an atmosphere of\npeace and goodwill. Dividing people in the name of religion can complicate\nthese issues further which can also pose a threat to the unity and integrity\nof the country. I appeal to the people of Jammu and Kashmir to cooperate\nwith us in establishing peace in the State. It is my conviction that all issues\ncan be resolved only through dialogue and peaceful means.\n\nBrothers and Sisters,\n\nOur ancient Himalayas are under environmental threat. If the Himalayan\nglaciers recede, the flow of water in our sacred rivers will go down. Climate\nchange can disrupt our economy in several ways. Some of our coastal\nareas could be submerged. Our monsoon pattern may change. We need\nlong term solutions to such threats. A national consensus is also required\nfor the Government to evolve effective policies to deal with these problems.\n\nOur Government has come forward with a National Action Plan on Climate\nChange. This plan shows how each of us must adapt our ways of working\nand living and how we must treat our natural resources, so that our carbon\nemissions remain within reasonable limits and our environment is\nprotected.\n\nMy fellow countrymen,\n\nOur goal in South Asia is to seek a peaceful, stable and prosperous\nneighbourhood. We seek to accelerate the pace of social and economic\ndevelopment in our country and our region, while safeguarding our national\nsecurity. Our foreign policy has been based on these principles.\n\nWe wish all our neighbours well. We welcome the strengthening of\ndemocratic forces in our neighbourhood, especially in Bhutan, Nepal and\nPakistan. The recent blasts in our Embassy in Kabul have cast a shadow\nover our efforts to normalize relations with Pakistan and to bring a lasting\nand honourable peace in our region. I have personally conveyed my\nconcern and disappointment to the Government of Pakistan.\nIf this issue of terrorism is not addressed, all the good intentions that we\nhave for our two peoples to live in peace and harmony will be negated. We\nwill not be able to pursue the peace initiatives we want to take. The\nterrorists and those who support them are enemies of the people of India\nand Pakistan, of friendship between the two countries and of peace in the\nregion and the world. We must defeat them.\n\nIn the last year we have strengthened our relations with the major powers,\nLatin American countries, Arab countries and African countries. We will\ncontinue our efforts in this direction, keeping in view our national interests.\n\nIndia is today viewed with respect as one of the world's fastest growing\neconomies. People of Indian Origin are engaged in diverse activities\naround the world and their capabilities are recognized the world over. Their\nachievements inspire us. The world today expects India to regain its due\nplace in the comity of nations. This is a moment of opportunity for us.\n\nWe are rapidly marching forward to regain our rightful place in the comity of\nnations. But to reach that goal we have a lot of work to do at home. We\nhave to overcome each of the challenges I have spoken about. We have to\nforge a greater unity of purpose between various political parties, between\ndifferent communities, between all sections of our society, rich and poor.\n\nWe have to manage our natural and financial resources more prudently.\nWe have an obligation to our future generations. We cannot think only for\nourselves. We cannot think only about survival from day to day, from year\nto year and from one election to another. We have to think about the\nwelfare and well-being of our children and grandchildren, their\ngrandchildren and future generations.\n\nIf we resolve to work together as a nation, and work hard and with\ncommitment to the welfare of all our people, there is nothing that we cannot\ndo.\nLet us resolve today to stand together, to strengthen the unity and integrity\nof our country and to stand firm in our determination to build a new India of\nour dreams.\n\nMy dear children, please join me in saying Jai Hind\n\nJai Hind\n\nJai Hind\n\nJai Hind"},{"year":2007,"pm":"Manmohan Singh","party":"INC","footnote":"Printed from the website http://www.pmindia.nic.in","source":"PMO Archive","url":"http://archivepmo.nic.in/drmanmohansingh/content_print.php?nodeid=551&nodetype=2","text":"My dear countrymen, brothers, sisters and dear children\n\nToday we celebrate the 60th anniversary of our Independence. My\ngreetings to you all on this day of national celebration.\n\nToday we take special pride in saluting our beloved tricolor. Let us recall\nwith pride the great sacrifice of our freedom fighters, whose undying love\nfor India secured us our freedom.\n\nOn this happy occasion join me in saluting the hard work of all our citizens\nwho have, over these 60 years, helped build a new India. Let us bow our\nhead in memory of all those brave jawans and all our brave citizens who\nhave sacrificed their lives for the cause of our unity, integrity and progress.\n\nSixty years ago the people of India began a new journey as a free nation,\ninspired by the message and vision of Mahatma Gandhi. But Gandhiji's\ndream of a free India would only be fully realized when we banish poverty\nfrom our midst.\n\nAs I stand here and look at our tricolor fly high and fly majestically, my\nthoughts go to what I have said at these ramparts in the last three years. I\nhave, over these three years, outlined a new vision of a caring India:\n\nAn India that is united despite its many diversities.\n\nAn India that is not divided by caste, creed or gender.\n\nAn India in which the creativity and enterprise of every citizen can find its\nfull and free expression.\n\nAn India in which the weak and downtrodden are empowered, the disabled\nfind support, the destitute find succour and every individual is touched by\nthe hand of progress and development.\nAn India in which no person or region is left out of the journey of\ndevelopment and progress.\n\nAn India in which every citizen can live a life of dignity, self- respect,\ndecency and hope; where every citizen feels proud to say - I am Indian!\n\nAn India that lives in peace with all neighbours and all nations.\n\nAn India that has regained its due place in the comity of nations.\n\nThis vision of India is our proud inheritance from our national movement.\nWe are committed to fully realizing it. We have worked hard to translate this\nvision into reality, through legislative action, new programmes and new\npolicies. Towards this end we have vastly increased fiscal support to social\nand human development.\n\nToday, when I look back, I can say with some satisfaction that we are\nundoubtedly moving forward in the right direction. We have been slow in\ntaking some steps; we have dithered at times, and stumbled some times.\nWe have had success on some fronts, and setbacks on some others. But,\nthere is no doubt that we have been steadfast in our resolve, firm in our\nconvictions and resolute in our commitment to the welfare of the common\nman (aam aadmi).\n\nWe do feel a sense of satisfaction that on many fronts we have done well.\nYet, we are aware that there is much more to be done. We have moved\nforward in the many battles against poverty, ignorance and disease. But\ncan we say we have won the war? We have been able to step up the rate\nof growth. But can we say we are satisfied with the pace? Even after years\nof development and rising growth rates, why have we not been able to\nbanish mass poverty and provide employment to all? Why do some regions\nof the country continue to lag behind?\nI ask these questions not to belittle our achievements, but to inspire us to\ngreater effort. I ask not to make you feel dispirited, but to enthuse you to\nmarch forward.\n\nSince Independence, our development process has empowered our\nworkers and farmers; it has made our citizens skilled and energetic; and,\nhas made our business class dynamic. They are driving higher economic\ngrowth through their creativity and enterprise. Our economy is now growing\nat historically unprecedented rates. This enables us to generate the\nresources required for eradication of poverty, for education and health care\nfor all. Poverty eradication is now a feasible goal.\n\nHow do we translate this goal into reality? We must understand that it is\nonly through sustained economic growth and development that we can\nbanish poverty from our midst. There is no magic wand. As creativity and\nenterprise blossom, new jobs are created and new incomes for new\ngenerations of working people.\n\nAs incomes rise, so do government revenues that help finance the large\nincrease in public expenditure that we need for poverty eradication, for\nuniversalisation of education and health care, for agriculture and irrigation,\nand for basic infrastructure. It is such investments that help eradicate\npoverty.\n\nOver the last three years, we have significantly increased public\nexpenditure in the social sectors. This is in line with our commitment to the\nwelfare of the aam aadmi. Central Government spending on education has\nbeen tripled. In health care, agriculture, irrigation and rural development it\nhas more than doubled.\n\nThis unprecedented expansion in social sector expenditure has enhanced\nthe welfare of our people. Through the historic National Rural Employment\nGuarantee Act, we have made basic employment for 100 days a legal right.\nAs a result the poorest of our poor are now assured of minimum household\nincome. Today half the country is covered by the programme. We are\ncommitted to implementing it across the entire country. We are confident\nthat this social safety net will fulfill Gandhiji's dream of antyodaya - our\nhumble attempt to wipe the tears of the poor.\n\nWe have kept our focus on giving a new deal to rural India. We have\ndoubled the supply of credit for farmers, reduced its cost and, where\nfarmers have been in distress, we have written off interest and rescheduled\nloans. We have helped increase farmers' income by raising substantially\nthe support price for wheat and rice. Through Bharat Nirman, we are\ninvesting in rural connectivity - road, electricity and telephone connectivity.\nBharat Nirman is our effort at bridging the urban rural divide.\n\nThis, I believe, is only a part of our total effort. There is more to be done\nand more will be done. In the coming years our main emphasis will be on\nagricultural development. We will soon launch a special programme to\ninvest Rs 25,000 crore in agriculture, to enhance the livelihood of our\nfarmers and increase food production. We will also focus on the needs of\nour farmers in dry and drought prone regions. I am touring a few states to\npersonally review the agricultural situation across the country.\n\nOur growing economy and population need more foodgrains. I am\nconfident that as we roll out our ambitious agricultural development\nprogramme, we will see a boost in food grain production in all parts of the\ncountry, particularly in regions untouched by the first Green Revolution.\nFarmers are the backbone of our nation. Unless they prosper, the nation\ncannot prosper. I reassure our farmers that their welfare lie at the core of all\nour concerns.\n\nThe transformation of rural India that we seek, and the progress we seek,\nare not possible unless we increase the productivity of our farms and the\nincome of our farmers. But, given the large population dependent on\nfarming and the small size of our farms, there are limits to how much\nincome agriculture alone can generate.\n\nIndia cannot become a nation with islands of high growth and vast areas\nuntouched by development. Where the benefits of growth accrue only to a\nfew. This is good neither for our society nor for our polity.\n\nTherefore, it is essential that we create new employment opportunities\noutside of agriculture. Remember, there is no developed country today\nanywhere in the world, that is not an industrial economy. Industrialization is\ncritical for progress.\n\nIf employment generation is the best weapon against poverty, then\nindustrialization is the most effective means to create new job\nopportunities. In the past 60 years, many parts of our country have\nbenefited from industrial development. In the next decade I want to see\nevery region of the country to similarly benefit from the growth of modern\nindustry. We will pursue policies that will help in our country's rapid\nindustrialization.\n\nIt is true that the transition from an agrarian society to an industrial\neconomy has always been a difficult one. But industrialization offers new\nopportunities and hope, especially for people in rural areas displaced by\nagrarian change. I agree that it is the responsibility of government to\nensure that displacement does not lead to impoverishment; that those who\nlose land do not lose livelihoods; and, that those who have lost employment\nget better opportunities. We are, therefore, giving final shape to a National\nPolicy for Rehabilitation and Resettlement for all those displaced by major\nprojects. It is our societal obligation to ensure that the processes of\ndevelopment ensure that everyone is better off, and no one is worse off.\n\nIndustrialization would also mean urbanization. As more and more people\nlive in urban areas, we need to have a more creative process of\nurbanization. This requires greater foresight in urban planning and\ndevelopment. Adequate compensation must be paid to those displaced and\nurban space must be used in an economical manner. We need to have\nadequate drainage facilities so that life in our cities does not come to a\nstandstill during heavy rains. The day is not far off when half a billion\npeople will be living in our cities and we need to prepare for that day.\n\nIndustrialization and urbanization will generate demand for first rate\ninfrastructure. The expansion and modernisation of our highways, roads,\nrailways and airports is visible proof of our efforts to meet this demand.\nMuch more is needed and will be done.\n\nWe need to do much more to generate and distribute more power, more\nefficiently. Everyone should get good quality power at affordable prices. I\nappeal to state governments to take this matter seriously as a weak power\nsituation can become a handicap in industrialization and job-creation.\n\nFor every one of our people to benefit from new employment opportunities\nbeing created across the economy, we must ensure that every Indian is\neducated and skilled. No nation can progress unless its people are\neducated. We have shown our Government's commitment in this regard by\ntripling public spending on education in the last three years. I request states\nalso to give priority to education, as education alone is the foundation on\nwhich a progressive, prosperous society can be built. Growing revenue\nearnings have improved the fiscal capacity of the States. They must now\ngive priority to education.\n\nTowards this end, our Government has decided to invest in setting up good\nquality schools across the country. We will support 6,000 new high quality\nschools - one in every block of the country. Each such school will set\nstandards of excellence for other schools in the area.\nAs our primary education programmes achieve a degree of success, there\nis growing demand for secondary schools and colleges. We are committed\nto universalizing secondary education. An extensive programme for this is\nbeing finalized.\n\nWe will also ensure that adequate numbers of colleges are set up across\nthe country, especially in districts where enrolment levels are low. We will\nhelp States set up colleges in 370 such districts.\n\nThe University system, which has been relatively neglected in recent years,\nis now the focus of our reform and development agenda. We will set up\nthirty new Central Universities. Every state that does not have a central\nuniversity will now have one.\n\nIn order to promote science and professional education, we are setting up\nfive new Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research, eight new\nIndian Institutes of Technology, seven new Indian Institutes of\nManagement, and twenty new Indian Institutes of Information Technology.\nThese will generate new educational opportunities for our youth. I am sure\nthat, working together, we can ensure that at least a fifth of our children go\nto college as compared to one-tenth now.\n\nThe vast majority of our youth seek skilled employment after schooling.\nLast year I spoke the need for a Vocational Education Mission. Such a\nMission is ready to be launched. We will soon launch a Mission on\nVocational Education and Skill Development, through which we will open\n1600 new industrial training institutes (ITIs) and polytechnics, 10,000 new\nvocational schools and 50,000 new Skill Development Centres. We will\nensure that annually, over 100 lakh students get vocational training - which\nis a four-fold increase from today's level. We will seek the active help of the\nprivate sector in this initiative so that they not only assist in the training but\nalso lend a hand in providing employment opportunities.\nWe should seek not just functional literacy, but good quality education -\neducation that is affordable, accessible, equitable - and available to every\nboy and girl who seeks to study. For the needy we will provide more\nscholarships.\n\nI wish to see a revolution in the field of modern education in the next few\nyears. It is my fervent desire that India becomes a fully educated, modern,\nprogressive nation. From this historic Red Fort, I would like this message to\ngo to every corner of India - we will make India a nation of educated\npeople, of skilled people, of creative people.\n\nDemocracy and development mean nothing for those who are not touched\nby the hand of progress. That is why, the architects of our Constitution\nplaced special emphasis on the empowerment of the Scheduled Castes,\nScheduled Tribes and other weaker sections of society. In 60 years, we\nhave seen many people climb the ladder of progress and social mobility.\nYet, there are millions who still need our support and assistance.\n\nWe are committed to the economic, social, political and educational\nempowerment of SCs, STs, OBCs and minorities. Apart from effective\nimplementation of all existing reservations for them, we have announced\nmajor scholarship and development programmes for their benefit. I am\nhappy to say that we have been able to persuade the private sector to\nsome extent to take affirmative action to ensure that these sections of\nsociety get a fair share of employment in industry and trade.\n\nWe have ensured that our tribal brethren get rights over land that they have\ncultivated for generations in forest areas. This should provide them a sense\nof security. The Prime Minister's 15-Point Programme is designed to\nensure that Minorities are not left out of development programmes and that\nthey have the necessary resources to transform their lives.\n\nI also affirm our commitment to the welfare and well being of people with\ndisabilities of various kinds, as well as our senior citizens for whom all of us\nhave a special place in our heart and mind. We have set up the National\nCommission for Protection of Child Rights to ensure that children are safe\nand well cared for.\n\nThe problem of malnutrition is a matter of national shame. We have tried to\naddress it by making the mid-day meal universal and massively expanding\nthe anganwadi system. However, success requires sustained effort at the\ngrassroots. Infants need to be breast-fed, have access to safe drinking\nwater and health care. We need the active involvement of the community\nand panchayats to see that what we spend reaches our children. I appeal\nto the nation to resolve and work hard to eradicate malnutrition within five\nyears.\n\nWhile we have moved ahead in the last three years on many fronts, there is\none area where considerable work remains to be done. Millions of our\nfellow citizens are not engaged in any formal employment in the organized\nsector. They work in small establishments, run their own little shops or offer\ntheir services on a daily basis. They have neither a social safety net nor a\nsense of economic security. They become destitute or indebted when they\nfall ill or suffer accidents. We are committed to their welfare and are taking\nsteps to provide this sense of security.\n\nWe will provide an old age pension to all citizens above the age of 65 and\nliving below the poverty line. We will also provide life and disability cover to\nthe heads of all poor families or to one earning member in each family so\nthat they and their families can get over the consequences of injury or\ndeath. We are also working on a health insurance model so that our poor\ndo not have to bear the high cost of medical care. These programmes will\nbe launched shortly.\n\nThere are many less developed regions in the country that must also\nbenefit from development and economic growth. It is necessary to increase\ninvestment in backward areas to improve the regional balance in\ndevelopment. Towards this end, we have created the Backward Regions\nGrant Fund covering 250 districts. Over a period of time, these funds and\nour other initiatives will see that these regions catch up with other parts of\nthe country. Every State, every district, every village, every person must be\ntouched by the hand of progress.\n\nIn the rush of modernization and the race to develop we must not forget the\nvalue of conserving our resources. Water is one such scarce resource. I\nwant each and every citizen to pay special attention to water conservation\nand to how we store and use water.\n\nI urge states to look upon water as a national asset and work to resolve\ninter-state disputes over water sharing with an attitude of give and take. It is\nonly through a cooperative approach that lasting solutions can be found to\nrecurring problems, like floods and drought. We should work together to\nprevent the destruction caused by the ravages of nature, like floods.\n\nIn protecting our environment let us recall Gandhiji's wise words that nature\nhas given us enough for everyone's need, but not for everyone's greed.\nThe Himalayas are part of our inheritance. Many of our rivers flow from\nthem. We must protect our glaciers; we must keep our rivers clean and\nmust increase our forest cover. Every citizen must ensure that our wildlife,\nespecially endangered species like tigers, lions and elephants are\npreserved for the benefit of future generations. Keeping India green and\nclean should be a national and an individual obsession.\n\nEach one of us must be aware of how what we do impacts on nature and\nour climate. People across the world are increasingly concerned about\nglobal warming. And so must we be. We must be economical in our\nconsumption of fuels and energy. This we owe humanity and to posterity.\n\nThe land from which the message first went out that the whole world is one\nfamily (Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam) must set an example for the rest of the\nworld in finding collective solutions to global problems.\n\nI also want our young people to actively associate themselves with a\n\"National Campaign for Cleanliness\" in our neighbourhoods, in public\nplaces and markets, in villages and slums. Let us all take that one extra\nstep to ensure that we live in clean and healthy surroundings. Each one of\nus can make a difference by practicing what we preach. As Gandhiji used\nto say, we must be the change we want to see.\n\nIn implementing our strategy of inclusive growth, State Governments,\nPanchayati Raj Institutions and Urban Local Bodies have a crucial role to\nplay. They must play an active role in mobilizing both resources and people\nfor development. As Shri Rajiv Gandhi used to say, Panchayats must be\nactively associated with social development at the grassroots. They must\nensure public participation in development programmes and proper\nfunctioning of our schools and hospitals.\n\nTo make the government, at all levels, more accountable and more\ntransparent, and to fight the cancer of corruption, we had introduced the\nRight to Information Act. I want every citizen to make full use of this act to\nensure that government functions properly and honestly.\n\nIn our quest for a caring, sharing and an inclusive society, we must develop\nthe spirit of good neighbourliness with all people, irrespective of caste,\ncreed or language. Our strength lies in our unity in diversity. Those who\nprofess hatred and extremism, those who spread the virus of communalism\nand those who believe in violence and terrorism have no place in our\nsociety. We must all fight these anti-democratic, anti-social and\nanti-national forces, each in our own way, in our daily lives. Let there be no\ndoubt in anyone's mind that the Government is firm in its resolve to fight all\nforms of extremism and terrorism.\nWe want to bring greater prosperity to the less developed regions of our\ncountry, especially the North-Eastern region and Jammu and Kashmir. This\nis our solemn commitment. Our State governments must be more active in\ncreating an environment conducive to investment.\n\nWe are investing in better infrastructure and connectivity in the\nNorth-eastern States. In Jammu & Kashmir, our long-term development\nplan is bringing new investment to all the three regions of the State.\nGrassroots democracy has taken deep roots in the State and the\nRoundtable discussions have opened new avenues for reconciliation and\ndevelopment.\n\nOur greatest achievement over the past 60 years has been the fact that we\nhave built the firm foundations of an open society and an open economy.\nAs a multi-cultural, secular democracy and home to all the great religions of\nthe world, we feel proud to be Indian. And the world has come to view this\nwith regard.\n\nThe success of a secular democracy in a nation of a billion people with\nsuch diversity is viewed with admiration. This great idea of India as a\nsymbol of unity in diversity is increasingly viewed with respect and regard.\nOur tolerance, our capacity to assimilate and our ability to reconcile the\nirreconcilable are objects of wonder. The world wants us to do well. Our\nchallenges lie at home.\n\nIndia wants to have good relations with all the countries of the world. Big\nand small. Countries of the East and the West, the North and the South.\nToday, we enjoy good relations with all major powers and all developing\ncountries. We have emerged as a bridge between the many extremes of\nthe world. Our composite culture is living proof of the possibility of a\nconfluence of civilizations. India will always be a nation bridging the many\nglobal divides.\nIndia wants to live in a neighbourhood of peace and prosperity. I assure all\nour neighbours that we in India want peace and the best of relations with all\nof them. I sincerely believe that in the prosperity and well-being of our\nneighbours lies the key to our own security and progress.\n\nWe are a young nation. More importantly, we are a nation of young people.\nOnce unleashed, the energy of our youth will drive India onto a new growth\npath. I assure you that for each one of you, and for our country, the best is\nyet to come.\n\nHowever, we must not be over-confident. We have a long march ahead.\nWe need at least a decade of hard work and of sustained growth to realize\nour dreams. We have to bridge the many divides in our society and work\nwith a unity of purpose. We need to think of the future and be steadfast in\nour resolve to march forward. We must capitalize the dynamism that\npervades our people, our youth, our farmers, our businesses,\n\nWe must have faith in our strength and confidence in our capabilities. Each\nof us have our individual identities. However, every citizen must recognize\nthat we are Indians first and last. We fritter away our time on petty issues\nand pointless personal differences. I urge all political parties, all political\nand social leaders to resist the temptation to divide people along narrow,\nsectarian lines. Our strength is in our unity, despite our diversity. It is that\nunity which gave us our Independence. It is that unity that gives us our\nstrength as a nation.\n\nThis was the dream of our founding fathers. This was the vision of our\nConstitution. We should not move away from this vision, and must face the\nfuture with courage. However, as Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru said from these\nramparts nearly sixty years ago, \"laws and constitutions do not by\nthemselves make a country great. It is the enthusiasm, energy and\nconstant effort of a people that make it a great nation.\"\nLet us all come together and work resolutely for the welfare of our people\nand for the development of our nation.\n\nJai Hind!"},{"year":2006,"pm":"Manmohan Singh","party":"INC","footnote":"Printed from the website http://www.pmindia.nic.in","source":"PMO Archive","url":"http://archivepmo.nic.in/drmanmohansingh/content_print.php?nodeid=353&nodetype=2","text":"My dear countrymen, brothers, sisters, and dear children\n\nMy greetings to all of you on this day, the anniversary of our Independence\n\n1. Today is an auspicious day for our country. Today we enter the 60th\nyear of our Independence. Today we re-dedicate ourselves to the progress\nand prosperity of our nation. To the welfare of all our people. To the unity\nand integrity of our country.\n\n2.     Today we salute our beloved tricolor. We pay tribute to Mahatma\nGandhi and all those freedom fighters because of whose efforts and\nsacrifices we secured our Independence. We remember all those whose\nhard work and efforts keep our flag flying high and keep our country on the\nroad to progress. We pay tribute to the brave members of our armed\nforces, farmers, teachers, scientists, workers and the millions of our\ncountrymen who are toiling tirelessly for the progress and prosperity of our\nnation.\n\n3.    In the early hours of the 15th of August, 1947, when our nation had\njust become Independent, our first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru spoke\nto the nation and asked us all one important question on the very first day\nwe became a free country: \"Are we brave enough and wise enough to\ngrasp this opportunity and accept the challenge of the future?\"\n\n4.    Today, my fellow citizens, I stand here once again and ask you that\nsame question. Are we ready to face the challenge of the future? Are we\nbrave enough, to do so, and wise enough, in doing so? Can we rediscover\nthe ideas and ideals that shaped our freedom struggle, and use them to\ntake our country forward into the future? Are we willing to show the courage\nand the wisdom that Panditji wanted us to show in building a new India in a\nnew world?\n\nMy dear countrymen,\n5.    The going has never been as good for India in the past as it is now.\nOur economy has been growing at an impressive pace of over 8%. Such\nrapid growth over three successive years is unprecedented in Indian\nhistory. Wherever I go, I see our nation on the move. Our industry and\nservices sectors are showing impressive growth. I see a reassuring\nconfidence in our industry in being able to take on the challenge of the rest\nof the world. The growth of the manufacturing industry has touched 11% in\nthe last quarter, generating many jobs for our youth and workers. I see our\nservice sector competing with the best and earning valuable foreign\nexchange.\n\n6.    All around us, we see new roads being built. The railways are\nexpanding their reach. New power plants are being built. New airports are\nbeing planned. Vast industrial estates and Special Economic Zones are\ncoming up. This dynamism is the result of the enterprise, creativity and\nhard work of millions of Indians. They are boldly taking our country into the\nfuture, treading on untrodden paths. I am sure this will result in far greater\nprosperity for our people. I sincerely believe that the most effective way to\nbanish poverty is to generate growth which in turn will create new\nopportunities for gainful employment. Hence, economic growth is of primary\nimportance for us.\n\n7.    It is almost sixty years since Independence. It is but a brief period in\nthe history of an ancient civilization. But, it is a long time in the life of a\nyoung nation. In these sixty years, the world has been transformed beyond\nrecognition. The empires of Europe have faded away. New powers have\nemerged in Asia. Look at where Japan was and where it is today. Look at\nwhere China was and where it is today. Look at where the countries of\nSouth-east Asia were and where are they today? When I see them, I\nwonder whether we are living up to our full potential or not.\n\n8.    India is certainly on the march. Yet, we have miles to go before we\ncan truly say that we have made our tryst with destiny. Sixty years ago,\nPanditji told us that the two challenges before a free India was to end the\nancient scourge of poverty, ignorance and disease and end the inequality\nof opportunity. India has marched a great distance forward in these sixty\nyears, but the challenge of banishing poverty remains with us. We have yet\nto banish hunger from our land. We have yet to eradicate illiteracy. We\nhave yet to ensure that every Indian enjoys good health.\n\n9.     There is visible progress all around. However, when I see this, I have\nsome worries. And I am aware, that every Indian has similar worries. Even\nas we move forward rapidly, to claim our rightful place in the comity of\nnations, I see that there are vast segments of our people who are\nuntouched by modernization; who continue to do backbreaking labour; who\ncontinue to suffer from iniquitous social orders. I see that our farmers in\nmany parts are in a crisis, not managing to eke out a decent living from\ntheir land. When I visited Vidarbha, the plight of the farmers there made a\ndeep impact on me. The agricultural crisis that is forcing them to take the\ndesperate step of committing suicide needs to be resolved. We need to\nthink about how we can provide a decent livelihood to our farmers?\n\n10. When I see large development projects coming up, while one rejoices\nat the progress that is being made, one worries for those who are\ndisplaced, for those who have lost their land and livelihood. When one sees\nour cities growing rapidly, one sees visible progress but at the same time,\none worries for the large number of people who live in their slums. When\nour industry and services compete successfully across the globe, we\ncelebrate our success in global markets; but at the same time, we are\nbuffeted by the same global forces when oil prices go up because of factors\nbeyond our control. Globalisation certainly has its benefits; but it can also\nhurt the common man.\n\n11. The challenge for us as a nation is to address this duality - to ensure\nthat while we keep the wheels of progress moving rapidly forward, no\nsection of society and no part of the country is left behind; to ensure that\ngrowth generates the necessary wealth which can then finance the welfare\nof marginalized groups; to ensure that growth generates employment and a\nbright future for our youth.\n\n12. In the past two years, it has been our endeavour to address these\nconcerns. We have taken many steps to expand employment opportunities\nand improve the quality of life in rural and urban areas.\n\n13. The National Rural Employment Guarantee Act has been enacted to\nprovide income security for those suffering from extreme poverty. The\nprogrammes under this Act, for which more than 2 crore families have\nalready registered, currently cover 200 districts and will be expanded\ngradually to cover the entire country. This pathbreaking Act is the most\nimportant social safety net for our poor. I am confident that this Act will help\nus in eradicating poverty.\n\n14. Bharat Nirman is another programme which will modernize our\nvillages. As our villages get fully electrified and get connected by roads and\ntelephones, their economies will prosper. As they get better irrigation\nfacilities, their agriculture will grow. As drinking water and housing facilities\nimprove, their living conditions will improve. They will participate in the\ngrowth which is already visible in urban India. I am happy that progress in\nthe first year of Bharat Nirman has been good and by 2009, I expect to see\nvisible results across the country.\n\n15. These programmes are our weapons in the \"War on Poverty\". The\nmost effective weapon against poverty is employment. And, higher\neconomic growth is the best way to generate employment. We must create\nan environment that encourages business to grow and create more\nemployment, especially in the manufacturing sector. We have created a\nconducive environment for our industrial enterprises to flourish and the\nresults of this are visible. We are supporting not just large industries, but\nalso the labour intensive small scale and handloom sectors through special\nprogrammes. Handlooms and textile industries employ over 3.5 crore\npeople. We are giving cheaper loans to this sector and handloom\ncooperatives are being revitalised. I am hopeful that in the coming years,\nlakhs of jobs will be generated in these sectors.\n\nMy dear countrymen\n\n16. Two years ago, speaking from the Red Fort, I promised a \"New Deal\nfor Rural India\". There is much we have done, but I know much more needs\nto be done. We have kept our word and almost doubled agricultural credit\nin less than three years as promised. We are providing short term loans to\nfarmers at 7%. We have waived interest on over-due loans for\ndebt-stressed farmers in Vidarbha and will do the same in other suicide\naffected districts. We are trying to reach institutional credit to each and\nevery farmer so that they are out of the clutches of moneylenders. For this,\nwe are reviving the cooperative banking system for which a Rs 13,000\ncrore package is being implemented. We have been paying special\nattention to horticulture, animal husbandry, cotton, sugarcane and other\ncrops. A National Fisheries Development Board has been set up for\nincreasing the livelihood of fishermen. Agricultural research is being\nimproved and Krishi Vigyan Kendras will soon be functioning in every\ndistrict of the country by the year end.\n\n17. However, I admit that much still needs to be done to improve the\nprospects for farmers. Especially in rain-fed areas and for dry-land\nagriculture. We will need to work towards ensuring more remunerative\nprices for our farmers. I am aware of the acute distress of our farmers who\nbear the burden of heavy debt. We have recently constituted an expert\ngroup to look into the problem of agricultural indebtedness. I am confident\nthat in a few months, we will take concrete measures to help our farmers\novercome the burden of crushing debt. Most importantly, we must ensure\nthat more people get employment in manufacturing and services so that the\ndisproportionate burden on agriculture in providing a livelihood to two-thirds\nof our population gets reduced.\n\n18. The results of our efforts to improve agriculture are clearly visible in\nsome places. Farmers are getting better prices for many crops. This helps\nthem earn a better livelihood. This, on the other hand hurts the common\nman when the prices of essential food commodities go up. We need to\nunderstand that if we want better prices for farmers so that they earn a\nbetter livelihood, the prices of what they produce and sell will have to go\nup! We certainly cannot grudge our farmers better incomes when incomes\nof other sections of society are rising! In order to ensure that the needy and\nthe poor do not get adversely affected, our government is committed to\nensuring adequate availability of essential commodities at affordable prices\nto them.\n\nBrothers and Sisters,\n\n19. I know that each of our families is concerned about the prices of\nessential commodities. Let me assure you that we will do whatever is\nrequired to keep prices under check. But I must remind you that two years\nago the international price of oil was just over $30 per barrel. Today it is\nclose to $75. Even though world oil prices have more than doubled, we\nhave succeeded in insulating our consumers to a great extent. Prices of\nkerosene and LPG have not been raised. But there is a limit to which we\ncan go on subsidizing the consumption of petroleum products in the face of\nrising import costs. How much more can the government treasury bear this\nburden? At some point, this will affect our ability to spend on other\nimportant development programmes. In order to keep food prices within the\nreach of the common man, we have even allowed the import of some\nproducts to meet the shortage in our markets.\n\nBrothers and sisters,\n20. While employment and agriculture are of immediate concern to all,\nour long term concern is for the future of our children. They need to be\nhealthy, well educated, with hope for the future. We launched the National\nRural Health Mission to provide better health care in rural areas. Under this\nprogramme, almost 2 lakh women have been kept as health assistants\n(ASHAs) at the village level; 4 lakh more women will be in place soon.\nThrough them, we will wage a war against malnutrition of children, against\nmalaria, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS and other diseases. These diseases put a\nheavy financial burden on our people. In Vidarbha, I was pained to meet\nfamilies of farmers who had committed suicide because they could not\nrepay the loans they had taken to meet the cost of health care of their loved\nones. We will take every possible step to help people overcome the burden\nof poverty and disease.\n\n21. The expanded Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan will ensure that all our children\ngo to school. Under the universal Mid-day Meal Programme, almost 12\ncrore children are getting a nutritious meal at school. Through these two\nprogrammes, we will ensure that all our children complete basic schooling.\nI request every citizen to ensure that every child of school-going age is\nenrolled in a school. We will pay particular attention to the empowerment\nthrough education of children belonging to Scheduled Castes, Scheduled\nTribes and Minorities. We will provide all possible assistance for the all\nround growth of children suffering from disabilities or with special needs.\nWe also will care for those who suffer from disabilities so that they can lead\na dignified life in society.\n\n22. All the initiatives that we have taken to push forward rural\ndevelopment and ensure farmers' welfare can be implemented only with\nthe active participation of our panchayats. For this to happen, our State\nGovernments have to empower our panchayats. We have to pay more\nattention to the quality of local administration - in our villages and districts,\nin our towns and cities. We need to rid our municipalities of the cancer of\ncorruption. State governments have a major role to play in this.\nBrothers and sisters,\n\n23. Cities and towns are centers of growth and generators of employment\nopportunities. Our cities need to have a new look for which they need\nmassive investment and renewal. They need basic amenities like\nsanitation, drinking water and proper housing for the poor. They need\npublic transport, parks and playgrounds. We need cities in which the\nworking poor can live with self-respect and dignity; cities in which children\nand women feel safe and secure. In order to ensure that our cities have\nbetter infrastructure and that they have better living conditions, we\nlaunched the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission. This\nprogramme and other similar ones have started showing results. Work has\nbegun on Metro systems in Bangalore and Mumbai. I see a glorious\ndecade of city development ahead of us.\n\n24. The challenge before Government is to implement these\nprogrammes. We have to improve the way governments function and\ndeliver public services. How do we do this? How do we ensure that higher\nfinancial outlays translate into better outcomes? I sincerely hope that the\nRight to Information Act enacted by our Government will empower our\npeople who will be able to use their rights to make government more\naccountable. We have to work hard to eliminate corruption in the delivery of\npublic services, in fact eliminate it from all walks of life. We will work to put\nin place a system that rewards honesty, probity and efficiency.\n\nBrothers and sisters\n\n25. India has contributed extensively to human knowledge. Today, we\nare at the dawn of a new millennium which many call the knowledge\neconomy. In this world, knowledge will determine our progress and the\nplace we occupy in the world. We must continue to be at the forefront of\nnew research and new thinking, especially in science and technology. We\nmust build top-class institutions. We have begun work on three new Indian\nInstitutes of Science, Education and Research in Kolkata, Pune and\nPunjab. We have also begun work on 19 medical institutions of the same\nstandard as AIIMS. We will need to ensure far greater availability of\neducational opportunities at the higher education level so that we have not\njust a literate youth but a skilled youth, with skills which can fetch them\ngainful employment. As our economy booms and as our industry grows, I\nhear a pressing complaint about an imminent shortage of skilled\nemployees. As a country endowed with huge human resources, we cannot\nlet this be a constraint. We are planning to launch a Mission on Vocational\nEducation so that the skill deficit in our economy is addressed.\n\n26. As we expand educational opportunities, we must ensure that these\nopportunities are accessible to all marginalized and weaker sections of our\nsociety. Our government is committed to providing reservation in\neducational institutions for students from socially backward sections of\nsociety. We will do so, while at the same time expanding educational\nopportunities for all youth. This is our solemn commitment. In this manner,\nwe will recognize and reward individual merit and hard work while working\nfor an inclusive society.\n\n27. While we are moving fast to develop every region of our country, we\nhave to take pains to see that this does not adversely affect those who are\ndisplaced. Nor should it affect our environment. Nor should any region of\nthe country get left behind. Our government will soon put in place a\ncomprehensive Rehabilitation Policy so that displacement does not lead to\nimpoverishment and those who lose their land benefit from subsequent\neconomic development. We have also taken special measures to save our\nwildlife, including the tiger. We are taking concrete steps to develop\nbackward regions through the Backward Regions Grant Fund and will be\nspending Rs 5000 crores annually in 250 districts.\n\nMy dear countrymen\n28. Our other concern is national security. India is facing two major\nthreats to its internal security. Terrorism and Naxalism. Just over a month\nago, Mumbai witnessed the most inhuman terrorist attack in the recent\npast, killing and injuring hundreds of innocent citizens. The entire nation\nwas pained by this suffering. Mumbai demonstrated its courage and\npatience and showed its resolve not to be cowed down by these incidents.\n\n29. I had said in Mumbai then that it cannot be business as usual for any\nof us. Terrorists want to undermine our growing economic strength; destroy\nour unity; and provoke communal incidents. We cannot allow this to\nhappen. Our strength lies in our unity. We will not allow the secular fabric of\nour country to be broken.\n\n30. I give my assurance to every citizen that we will do our utmost to\npreserve our unity and integrity, to make our country safe and secure for\nevery citizen. We will modernize, strengthen and properly equip our\nsecurity forces and our intelligence agencies. We will leave no stone\nunturned in ensuring that terrorist elements in India are neutralized and\nsmashed. Let those who want to hurt us by inflicting a thousand cuts\nremember - no one can break our will, or unity. No one can make India\nkneel.\n\n31. While terrorism has been raising its ugly head time and again, we\nhave also seen peace having its victories. The people of Jammu and\nKashmir continue to face the wrath of terrorism. But they have also seen\nnew rays of hope for peace and progress. New links of connectivity have\nbrought people on both sides of the Line of Control closer - Srinagar to\nMuzaffarabad, Poonch to Rawalkot. Through the Round Table\nConferences, we have started a dialogue with all political groups and\nparties of Jammu and Kashmir. We are jointly exploring new pathways to\nbuild a better tomorrow for its people - a tomorrow where they can live in\npeace and dignity, free from fear, want and exploitation.\n32. Today the people of the North-Eastern region look to the future with\nhope. The last two years have seen immense progress in the North East in\nall spheres of development - better roads, better rail connectivity, the first\never thermal power projects in the region and better universities. I am\nhopeful that in the coming few years, the North-eastern region will gradually\ncatch up with the rest of the country. However, many states here are still\nafflicted by insurgency. There is a great desire among the people of the\nregion for peace and tranquility. While we are determined to tackle\ninsurgency, we are hopeful that the dialogue that we have initiated with\nmany disaffected groups will produce a peace dividend. A life of progress\nand prosperity with self-respect and dignity is the right of the people there\nand we are confident of providing it.\n\n33. I want those who have mistakenly taken to Naxalism to understand\nthat in democratic lndia, power will never flow from the barrel of a gun. Real\npower flows from the ballot box. At the same time, our State Governments\nmust pay special attention to the welfare of our tribals and small and\nmarginal farmers. It is their distress that Naxalites exploit. The path of\nviolence can never solve the problems of the poor. Our security forces will\nrespond appropriately to the violence unleashed by Naxalites.\n\n34. In the past one month, many parts of the country, particularly Andhra\nPradesh, Surat and Maharashtra, have been badly affected by floods and\nthere has been extensive loss of life and property. We will provide all\npossible assistance for the relief of these regions.\n\nBrothers and Sisters,\n\n35. Every Indian wants to live in a neighbourhood of peace, stability and\nprosperity. People in our neighbouring countries share the same\naspirations. South Asia is a common cultural and economic unit. Our past\nand destinies are inter-linked. India, as the largest country in the region, is\nready to give our neighbours a stake in our own prosperity and share the\nfruits of our growth with them. However, the dream of a South Asian\ncommunity, where borders have ceased to matter and there is an\nunhindered flow of goods and peoples, culture and ideas, can hardly be\nrealized if terrorist violence and the politics of hate and confrontation\ncontinue to cast a dark shadow.\n\n35. We are prepared to work together with all our neighbours to usher in\nan era of peace and prosperity for our peoples. We have taken several\ninitiatives in this regard, in particular with Pakistan. To be successful, these\ninitiatives need an atmosphere of peace. It is obvious that unless Pakistan\ntakes concrete steps to implement the solemn assurances it has given to\nprevent cross-border terrorism against India from any territory within its\ncontrol, public opinion in India, which has supported the peace process, will\nbe undermined. All countries in our region must recognize that terrorism\nanywhere is a threat to peace and prosperity everywhere. It must be\nconfronted with our united efforts. There is a large constituency for peace\nand shared prosperity among our people and we must work together to\nbuild on that.\n\n37. In the past two years, we have succeeded in creating an international\nenvironment which supports our development aspirations. Our relations\nwith the United States of America, China, Japan, and the European Union,\nhave never been better and with Russia, we have further strengthened our\ntime-tested partnership. In South-East Asia, India has been welcomed into\nthe East Asian Summit. There has been a significant expansion of both our\npolitical and economic links with countries of the Gulf and the Arab world.\nThe continents of Africa and Latin America are now the new areas of focus\nfor our diplomacy and India's engagement has become truly global. We are\nrecognized for the scale of our achievements since Independence and the\nworld wants India to progress.\n\nMy dear countrymen,\n38. India is a young nation. India is a nation of young people. Our youth\nare ready to work hard for a bright future. Our former Prime Minister, Shri\nRajiv Gandhi, was greatly concerned about the prospects for our youth and\ntook many steps for ensuring a bright future for them.\n\n39. Even today, the youth of our country are in search of a bright future.\nThey seek new opportunities and are in search of new possibilities. They\nare willing to think in new ways. They have no time for old ideas and\nideologies. They want to build a new India. We must build a new India of\ntheir dreams. I want every one of our youth to walk shoulder to shoulder,\nand walk forward with us in building a new India. Every young person must\nhave faith in our future. To know that this country will create opportunities\nfor all for the full expression of their talent and skill.\n\n40. We have a dream of an India in which every woman can feel safe,\nsecure and empowered. Where our mothers, sisters and daughters are\nassured a life of dignity and personal security. We must end the crime of\nfemale foeticide. We must eliminate gender disparities. We must see that\nevery young woman is educated and skilled and capable of guiding a new\ngeneration.\n\n41. The laws of our land are meant to protect every law abiding citizen.\nThe rule of law can become a reality only if justice is seen to be delivered.\nOnly if the rights of law-abiding citizens are protected. We need a more\nefficient, humane and responsive police force. We also need a more\nefficient and effective judiciary. Our government will work to make this\npossible.\n\n42. Today, from this historic Red Fort, I appeal to every one of you to\nre-dedicate yourself to build a new India.\n\n-     An India that is united in thought, not divided by religion and\nlanguage.\n\n-     An India that is united in our Indianness, not divided by caste and\nregion.\n\n-     An India that is united in seeking new opportunities for growth, not\ndivided by disparities.\n\n-     An India that is caring and inclusive.\n\n43. Our religions may be different. Our castes may be different. Our\nlanguages may be different. But we are all Indians. In our progress lies the\nprogress of the nation. Our fortunes and our nation's fortunes are\nintertwined. And working together, we can make this fortune a glorious one.\n\n44. If we have to fulfil our potential, we need a politics that will help us\nrealize it. We need a politics that will propel us forward. We need a politics\nthat will guide us to new frontiers, take us to new horizons. I urge all our\npolitical leaders to think deeply about the future of our country. We must\nshun the politics of divisiveness and adopt the politics of change and\nprogress. Our political parties and leaders must learn to work together. To\nbuild a consensus around national issues. If we are able to do so, then I am\nconfident that then we will soon be able to realize the golden future which\nmillions of our countrymen are eagerly waiting for.\n\n45.   Let us all join together, hand in hand, to build a new India.\n\nJai Hind.\n\nJai Hind.\n\nJai Hind."},{"year":2005,"pm":"Manmohan Singh","party":"INC","footnote":"Printed from the website http://www.pmindia.nic.in","source":"PMO Archive","url":"http://archivepmo.nic.in/drmanmohansingh/content_print.php?nodeid=160&nodetype=2","text":"My Dear Countrymen, Brothers and Sisters and Dear Children,\n\nToday is once again a day of joy and happiness when we all gather to\ncelebrate the anniversary of our Independence. On this sacred occasion, I\ngreet you all.\n\nFifty eight years ago, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru had unfurled this glorious\nTricolour for the first time from this historical place, thus fulfilling the\ncenturies-old dream of crores of Indians to be independent from foreign\nrule.\n\nNext year, we will commence the celebrations of the 150th anniversary of\nthe First Battle of Independence. Through the celebrations, we will have a\nchance to once again remember the glorious freedom fighters of that great\nbattle who had laid the foundations for our independence. In 1857,\nBahadurshah Zafar had declared the Battle for Independence from this\nsame historic Red Fort. The battle cry of Rani of Jhansi Lakshmi Bai,\nPeshwa Nana Saheb, Tantia Tope and Begum Hazrat Mahal of Lucknow\nwas - \"Delhi Chalo\". This cry was renewed with vigour and force by Netaji\nSubhash Chandra Bose and in 1947 this ambition was fulfilled. Today, we\nhave the opportunity of remembering their sacrifices. We can also learn\nfrom their enthusiasm and self-confidence, a number of traits which will be\nuseful in facing today's challenges as well.\n\nToday is a day when we feel proud of and celebrate our victory in the\nstruggle for independence. This is a day of joy and happiness for all\nIndians, irrespective of where they reside in any part of the world. It is also\na day on which we remember our valiant soldiers and security forces, thank\nthem for their bravery and commitment, and hope that they will continue to\nbe alert in the service of the nation.\n\nMahatma Gandhiji had also dreamt of the same independence when he\nlaunched the Dandi March 75 years ago. Through that struggle, he shook\nthe foundations of the greatest and most powerful empire the world had\never seen. Today, we need to once again remember the sacrifice and\ncommitment of the Father of the Nation Mahatma Gandhi and also his\ndreams for an independent nation. We also need to reflect on how far we\nhave been successful in fulfilling his dreams.\n\nWhat was the dream Gandhiji had of an independent India? He had said, \"I\nwill work for an India where the poorest of the poor feel that this country\nand this nation belongs to them and that they have a major role in its\nconstruction. An India where there is no higher class or lower class among\nall people. An India where all communities live in friendship and harmony.\nAn India where women have the same rights as men.\" He had also said, \"\nthe Swaraj I dream of is a Swaraj of poor people. I have not the slightest\nhesitation in saying that Swaraj cannot be complete till the poorest have a\nguarantee of being provided with the basic necessities of life\".\n\nHave we come anywhere near this dream? In the last one year, our attempt\nhas been to build the India of Gandhiji's dream. The goal of our\nGovernment's National Common Minimum Programme is also the same.\nLast year on this very day, I had said from the Red Fort that I have no\npromises to make but only promises to keep. In order to fulfil the promises,\nwe have taken many important steps and have taken major decisions\nwhich will contribute to our nation's progress. While taking these decisions,\nthe focus of our thoughts and attention has always been the aam aadmi.\nThe effort of our government has been that while we continue to make\nrapid economic progress, the benefits of this progress and growth must\nreach all sections of society in a fair manner. Our vision is not just of\neconomic growth, but also of a growth which would improve the life of the\naam aadmi.\n\nOur country is witnessing unprecedented economic growth at this point in\ntime. Last year, our economic growth rate was 7% and it is likely to be\nsimilar this year as well. Our country has never witnessed such consistently\nhigh growth rates in the past. I am confident that if we maintain this\nmomentum of growth for the next 5?10 years, then it would be possible for\nus to eradicate poverty, ignorance, hunger and disease from our country.\nThis is not a dream but something that is possible in our times.\n\nIt is not only us but the entire world, which is viewing India as an emerging\npower of these times. The whole world is eagerly watching the manner in\nwhich India is making rapid economic progress. And this economic growth\nis happening within the framework of a liberal democracy. Our country is a\nmulti-cultural, multi-religious, multi-lingual and multi-ethnic nation. Nowhere\nin the world do we have an example of a country of a 100 crore people\nseeking their economic and social destiny within the framework of a\ndemocracy. It is because of this that the entire world's attention is riveted\non us. It is the result of our combined hard work that India today has made\nits mark on the world stage and we feel proud of our standing in the comity\nof nations.\n\nBrothers and Sisters,\n\nIt is my belief that India's future is extremely bright and that this future is\nindeed, possible. In order to achieve this, we need to focus on achieving\nrapid economic growth and on ensuring social justice. It is only by walking\non these two legs will we be able to ensure that the benefits of growth\nreach all sections of society.\n\nLast year, while addressing the nation on this day, I had mentioned that our\ngrowth is critically dependent on seven sectors which I called the 'Saat\nSutras'. These seven sectors were - agriculture, irrigation, education,\nhealth, employment, urban renewal and infrastructure. Today, we can\nreview the progress made in these seven areas.\n\nOur maximum emphasis has been on agriculture. Farmers are the\nbackbone of our country and of our economy. It is the result of their tireless\nefforts that we do not have any shortage of foodgrains in our country. The\nentire country is grateful to them for this.\n\nWe must admit that the economic growth we have been referring to earlier\nhas not yet fully reached every individual in our society. This is particularly\ntrue in our rural areas. The growth in agriculture has not been at the\nrequired pace. Even today, over 60% of our population is dependent on\nagriculture and every farmer has a right to be a participant in our economic\ngrowth processes. Hence, we have talked about giving a 'new deal' to our\nfarmers. We have taken a number of steps to alleviate the problems of our\nfarmers, such as improving and enhancing the flow of agricultural credit,\nincreasing investment opportunities and storage facilities, launching a\nNational Horticulture Mission to increase the output and trade in fruits and\nvegetables, and promoting research and training in agriculture. It is our\ngoal that by 2007, there should be a Krishi Vigyan Kendra in every district.\nThrough this, the benefits of advanced research and training will reach all\nour rural brethren. Large parts of our country are still dependent on rainfall\nand we will focus on removing the problems of farmers in dry land areas.\nWe are considering setting up a National Rainfed Area Authority for this\npurpose. It is our hope that in the coming years, agricultural growth\nbecomes rapid and we have a new green revolution. We are fully\ncommitted to achieving this.\n\nIt is not possible for our rural areas to develop in the absence of basic\ninfrastructural facilities. In order to improve basic infrastructure in rural\nareas, we have conceived an ambitious programme called 'Bharat Nirman'.\nIn Bharat Nirman, one crore hectares of unirrigated land will be irrigated. All\nvillages whose population is 1000 or more, and 500 or more in hilly areas,\nwill be connected with roads. Two and a half crore houses will be given\nelectricity connections, and through this, the entire country will be\nelectrified. Over 60 lakh houses will be built in villages. The remaining\n74,000 habitations which do not have access to safe drinking water will be\nprovided these facilities. Each and every village will have at least one\ntelephone connection. I am confident that Bharat Nirman will ensure the\nrapid economic development of our rural areas.\n\nIn all our economic programmes, our policy has been to ensure the\nparticipation of the common man, particularly of those in rural areas. They\nshould feel that all programmes belong to them. We have believed that the\nproper institutional mechanism to ensure their participation in the\nPanchayat system. Shri Rajiv Gandhiji had dreamt of Panchayati Raj many\nyears ago. Today, zila, tehsil and village panchayats have a major\nresponsibility to discharge. Our Constitution has placed the responsibility\non panchayats, not only of ensuring economic development but also\ndelivering social justice. Bharat Nirman provides a unique opportunity to\nour panchayats to shoulder this immense responsibility by effectively\nimplementing this programme. I am confident that panchayats will ensure\nBharat Nirman becomes a milestone in our development process.\n\nWe are giving importance not only to our rural areas but also to the\neconomic conditions in our urban areas. Today, a third of our population\nlives in urban areas and keeping in mind the speed at which urbanization is\ntaking place, the day is not far off when over 50% of India's population will\nbe residing in urban areas. The foundations of our culture and society were\nlaid thousands of years ago in the cities on the banks of Indus River. We\ntaught the world the basic concepts of urban planning. However, today our\ncities are often unable to meet the basic needs of their residents on many\ncounts. We will be investing in urban areas and for this, a National Urban\nRenewal Mission has been launched.\n\nWe have a large proportion of young people in our population. We will need\nto invest in their education and health so that their future prospects are\nbright. By doing so, our population will become our biggest asset.\n\nIt is necessary for every section of society to be literate and educated so\nthat they can take advantage of our growth processes. By strengthening\nSarva Shiksha Abhiyan, we are trying to ensure universalisation of primary\neducation. We are giving special emphasis to the education of the girl child.\nWe need to make education joyful, interesting and meaningful so that\nchildren develop a desire to go to school. We need to pay particular\nattention to the education of first generation learners. We are resolute in\nour commitment to see that no child is deprived of the benefit of primary\neducation. It is our hope that in the near future, women are as literate as\nmen. In order to achieve these goals, resources shall not be a constraint.\nWe are also committed to providing education to disabled children as well.\n\nAlong with primary education, we also need to pay attention to higher\neducation. If India is seen around the world as a rising knowledge power, it\nis because of our Universities and Research Institutions. If we want to\nmaintain our rapid economic growth, we need to improve the quality of\nthese institutions and also create many more such institutions. Let us\nresolve to achieve excellence in academic work in the 150th anniversary\nyear of the Universities of Kolkata, Mumbai and Chennai.\n\nHowever educated an individual may be, it is necessary for the person to\nbe healthy in order to lead a happy life. Through the National Rural Health\nMission, we will provide the best primary health care facilities in each and\nevery village. We are confident that by providing excellent primary health\ncare, we will be able to improve the health of young mothers and children\nwhich will then lead to a consequent reduction in our population growth\nrate.\n\nIn the last fifty years, we have been able to control and eliminate many\ndiseases which have been a scourge in our country. Leprosy has been\neliminated in 25 states. Polio and T.B. are also being gradually brought\nunder control. AIDS is now becoming a major national problem and we\nneed to tackle this on a war-footing. We need to have a mass movement to\nensure that this disease is rapidly checked and its growth arrested. We will\nalso ensure that medicines are available to common people at reasonable\nprices.\n\nAs I had mentioned earlier, the true test of development is the number of\npeople who have secured employment and the number of families who\nhave prospered as a result. As long as there is widespread unemployment\nin the country, we cannot claim that we are truly independent. It is with this\ngoal in mind that Smt. Indira Gandhi had given the nation the goal of 'Garibi\nHatao'. Today, if we need to remove poverty, we need to create\nemployment \"Rozgar Badhao\". In order to ensure that a minimum level of\nemployment is available to everyone in rural areas, it is necessary to have\nan employment guarantee. The National Rural Employment Guarantee Bill\nhas been prepared with this goal in mind. We hope that this Act will bring\nabout a revolutionary change in the lives of people in rural India. We are\nalso revamping the Khadi and Village Industries Commission so that more\nemployment is generated through small and village industries.\n\nIn order to ensure that our economic growth does not slow down, it is\nnecessary to have strong infrastructure. Economic growth is intrinsically\nlinked to the availability of infrastructure. Railways, roads and electricity are\nimportant elements of infrastructure. In order to improve our railways, a rail\nmodernization programme has been prepared so that our railways become\none of the best in the world. A dedicated freight corridor is being developed\nbetween Delhi-Kolkata and Delhi-Mumbai by investing over Rs. 25,000\ncrore rupees.\n\nThe development of our national highways is progressing at a rapid pace.\nWe have begun work on an additional 30,000 km of highways and we will\nsoon be six-laning the Golden Quadrilateral. There has been tremendous\nprogress in civil aviation. World class airports are being constructed in\nmany cities. Ports are being modernized and many new ports are under\nconstruction.\n\nShortage of electricity is still a major inconvenience. Electricity is an\nessential ingredient of economic development. We need to ensure that\nelectricity generation grows rapidly and that power shortages are\neliminated. We need far greater investment in this sector. I have often said\nthat, excepting for the poorest sections of society, giving electricity free of\ncost to other sections will worsen the financial condition of our electric\nutilities. We need to get used to paying a reasonable price for electricity just\nas we do for petroleum products. Through this, we can ensure supply of\nelectricity in the right quantity, at the right time and of right quality. In my\nvisit to the United States, we have managed to reduce some of the\nconstraints which have been hampering the growth of our nuclear energy\nprogramme and in the next 10 years, in addition to the 1,50,000 MW of\ncapacity being added in the thermal and hydro sectors, another 40,000 MW\ncould be generated through nuclear energy.\n\nWhile rapid economic growth is one facet of our vision for the nation, social\njustice and equitable development is the other facet. Last year, our greatest\ncontribution to the nation has been to bring it back on the path of rapid\neconomic growth. There is a ray of hope in the lives of all weaker sections\nof society. There is an atmosphere of calm, peace and communal harmony\nall around the country. We believe that this is an important achievement.\n\nIn our country, scheduled castes, scheduled tribes, backward classes and\nwomen suffer from many disabilities. Many of them have been\ndiscriminated against for centuries. It is essential that they are made\nstakeholders and participants in our development processes. We are\ncommitted to paying attention to their education, health and basic\nnecessities. We have taken some steps to improve their economic and\nsocial status. A Bill has been introduced in Parliament on reservation in\ngovernment employment. It will be our effort now to increase the\nopportunities for employment and equal opportunities in employment\noutside Government.\n\nOur Adivasi brothers have been cultivating land near forests for many\ngenerations. However, they do not have any rights on this land owing to\nwhich they live in constant fear of eviction. Their rights were snatched away\nfrom them 150 years ago during British rule. In order to correct this, we are\nbringing a legislation which will benefit scheduled tribes living in forests\nwhile at the same time ensuring conservation of our natural heritage.\n\nOur Constitution provides for equality of all religions. All religions are safe\nand secure within our Republic. It is essential that minorities should have\nevery opportunity of carrying on their daily activities with a feeling of\nsecurity and happiness. This is also our goal. Hence we have repealed\nPOTA. As a result, many sections of society are able to breathe easy. We\nhave commissioned a report on the social economic status of minorities.\nThis is being done for the first time and will be the basis for all our policy\ninterventions for improving their status. We will also revive and revamp the\n15 Point Programme for Minorities. The New 15 Point Programme will have\ndefinite goals which are to be achieved in a specific time frame.\n\nWe are going to start a special development programme which will focus\non the skill enhancement of artisans and weavers, many of whom are\nminorities. This will help improve their incomes.\n\nIndustrial growth is the result of the sweat and toil of our working classes.\nThis year, our industrial growth in May has exceeded 10%. I would like to\ncongratulate all our workers for this magnificent result. The Government will\npay specific attention towards addressing the problems of workers,\nparticularly those in the unorganized sector. It is our hope that we will be\nable to provide a social security net for them so that they do not feel\ninsecure in times of distress. However, I would like to emphasize that\nworkers too have a responsibility. Wherever they may be working, in\nfactories or in firms, they should work in cooperation with the management\nso that profitability of enterprises increases and they also benefit from this.\n\nWomen are the backbone not only of our homes but also of our nation. We\nneed to strengthen their hands and empower them fully. We have brought\nlegislation to prevent domestic violence against women and to secure their\nproperty rights. We will also ensure reservation for women in Parliament\nand Legislative Assemblies.\n\nIn order to provide an opportunity for our youth and sportspersons to\ndemonstrate their skills, we will make all possible efforts to ensure that\nIndia once again hosts the Asian Games in Delhi, the first since 1982.\n\nIn this new phase of development, we are acutely aware that all regions of\nthe country should develop at the same pace. It is unacceptable for us to\nsee any region of the country left behind other regions in this quest for\ndevelopment. In every scheme of the Government, we will be making all\nefforts to ensure that backward regions are adequately taken care of. This\nhas been ensured in the Food for Work Programme and the National Rural\nHealth Mission. We will also focus on the development of our border areas.\nWe will ensure that these regions are provided basic infrastructure such as\nroads, electricity and telephone connectivity in the next 3 - 4 years.\n\nOur rivers are the lifelines of the country. They are the foundations of our\nancient civilization. Today the demand for water is growing all around. In\nthe 21st century, water will the most precious commodity and its shortage\nwill be felt all around. We need to launch a national movement to prevent\nthe wastage of water and for its efficient use. This is an absolute necessity.\nIt is also necessary that all states of our country work together in a spirit of\ngive and take and a spirit of mutual understanding to sort out all\ncontentious issues amicably so that everyone is benefited.\n\nWe also need to pay special attention to our environment. We need to start\na national campaign for cleanliness - so that our cities, towns, villages,\nroads, streets and homes are neat and clean. Gandhiji used to emphasise\nthis aspect in his Ashram as well. We need to stop the pollution of our\nrivers and atmosphere. We need to protect our forests and natural heritage.\nWe must remember that we are only the custodians of our environment and\nit is our responsibility to preserve and pass it on to our future generations.\n\nIn the recent past, natural calamities have affected many parts of our\ncountry with disastrous effects on people and property. A tsunami in\nDecember, snowfall in January and floods in July. Lot of people have lost\ntheir precious lives in these calamities. The entire nation's sympathies are\nwith the bereaved families. I am confident that we will face the problems of\nfloods in a united manner, just we faced the devastation caused by the\ntsunami. Last month, Mumbai suffered immense damage and lost many\nlives because of unprecedented floods. In these difficult circumstances, the\ncitizens of Mumbai have shown courage fortitude and patience in dealing\nwith the enormous problems and have demonstrated the qualities which\nmake Mumbai different from other cities. I would like to assure that we will\nprovide whatever assistance is required to ensure that Mumbai,\nMaharashtra, Gujarat and Karnataka are restored to normalcy. In order to\neffectively tackle such natural calamities, we have constituted a National\nDisaster Management Authority. Through this, and by using the latest\ntechnologies, we hope to face future calamities in a much better manner.\n\nIn the country, we still have regions such as Jammu & Kashmir and the\nNorth-East where complete peace and tranquility does not exist. The\npeople in these regions are the victims of violence and terrorism. Wherever\nconditions deteriorate we take the assistance of our Armed Forces.\nWherever we have taken their assistance, they have shown patience and\nperseverance. Many of them have lost their lives. In order to ensure that\nthe children of soldiers who have laid down their lives in the service of the\nnation get good education, we are starting a Prime Minister's Scholarship\nScheme. Each year, 5000 children would be provided scholarships for\ncollege education.\n\nHowever, accidents do happen once in a while. Keeping this in mind and\nwith a view to protecting human rights, the Government had set up a\nCommittee to look into the provisions of the Armed Forces Special Powers\nAct. The Report of this Committee is being examined in detail and we will\ntake all necessary steps so that there are no violations of human rights\nunder this Act.\n\nAs a result of our policy in Jammu & Kashmir, the State is once again on\nthe path of peace and progress. It is our humanitarian obligation that we\nassist the State in all possible ways so that the people there can live in\npeace and harmony. Terrorists have never been the friends of the people\nof Kashmir. As long as they continue their terrorist attacks, our Armed\nForces will be alert and give them a fitting response. In this conflict,\ncommon citizens may also be affected at times. I have said before and I am\nrepeating once again, that there is no issue that cannot be resolved\nthrough a process of discussion and dialogue. Our doors are always open\nand will continue to be open for anyone interested in dialogue. I invite\neveryone to join us to discuss the problems of the state of Jammu &\nKashmir so that its people can lead a life of peace and dignity. If violence\ncontinues, then our response too will be hard. I am aware that the\nGovernment of Pakistan has put some checks on the activities of terrorists\nfrom its soil. However, it is not possible to achieve success through\nhalf-hearted efforts. It is necessary that the entire infrastructure of terrorism\nis totally dismantled.\n\nIn the context of terrorism and extremism, development and security have\nan intrinsic relationship. We have managed to face extremism successfully\nthrough a democratic process. However, it is imperative that a democratic\ngovernment should be able to differentiate between the genuine problems\nof people and the designs of terrorists. Today, there are a number of\nchallenges in our security environment such as terrorism, communal\nviolence, atrocities on women and exploitation of dalits and adivasis. Our\nsecurity forces have been facing the daunting task of controlling extremist\nviolence admirably. Extremism is a challenge which requires a united\nresponse from all of us. However, it is also necessary to look at a political\nresolution of this problem. Often extremism has its roots in backwardness\nand lack of economic development. It is not easy to handle problem of\nextremism in violation. However, by addressing it in all its dimensions -\nsocial, political, economic and security - in an integrated manner, I am\nconfident that we will be successful in checking it.\n\nIndia has always been a country which loves peace. Its destiny is\nintrinsically linked to those of its neighbours. Our goal has always been the\nprosperity and happiness of our citizens. Hence, we have always sought\nthe friendship of our neighbours, although at times, this has not been fully\nsuccessful. There seems to be some success in our search for peace and\nharmony now. Many problems of South Asia are similar, of which poverty\nand illiteracy are the most widespread. It is possible for us to eliminate\nthese in the region by working together.\n\nThe composite dialogue process with Pakistan is continuing. As a result,\nwe have been able to reopen the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad highway which\nwas a long pending demand of the people and restarted the bus service on\nthis route, a step which has been widely welcomed. Talks are going on to\nopen similar links from points in other states.\n\nDiscussions are also going on a gas pipeline from Iran to India via\nPakistan. Once this is completed, we will be able to address a major\nconstraint affecting our economy.\n\nIt is our sincere hope that we work with all our neighbours in South Asia to\neffectively address the challenges of poverty, unemployment and disease.\nIf India and Pakistan are able to work together, than we will have many\nopportunities for making our countries prosperous. I am confident that we\nwill be able to fulfill this vision.\n\nWe have had historic links and relations with Afghanistan. It is our desire to\nsee Afghanistan prosperous and strong. In a few days, I will be going to\nAfghanistan. We will try to strengthen and support democracy and\neconomic growth in all possible ways.\n\nOur largest neighbour is China with whom we have a centuries-old\nrelationship, a relationship from which both of us have learnt a lot and\nimbibed a lot. We are today willing and ready to deepen our trade and\ncultural relations with China for the benefit of the two nations. The\nagreement arrived at between our two countries in April has paved the way\nfor a closer relationship.\n\nI greet the people of Sri Lanka, Mauritius, Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan,\nMaldives and Myanmar and assure them with utmost sincerity that India is\nwilling to work together with them for promoting development, prosperity\nand peace in the region.\n\nMy visit to the United States has been a major step in promoting friendship\nwith that country. By deepening our economic and technological relations,\nwe will be accelerating our own growth. Simultaneously, our two\ndemocracies can work together to strengthen democracy in the world.\nRussia is an old friend who has helped us in difficult times. We will deepen\nour friendly relations with Russia.\n\nWe also wish to deepen our relations with the countries to the East. The\nrecently concluded trade agreement with Singapore is a major step in\nimproving our economic engagement with the region. We will be entering\ninto many more such agreements in future.\n\nAt this point, I would like to emphasize that the contribution of Indians and\npersons of Indian origin settled abroad in ensuing that our efforts are\nsuccessful is enormous. They have not only traveled to far off lands to\nachieve their dreams of prosperity for themselves and their children, but\nhave also played a stellar role in changing the world's perception of India.\nThe world today sees India as a major knowledge power whose people are\nskilled, competent, hard working and peace loving. Even within our own\ncountry, our scientists, doctors, engineers and scholars have contributed\nsubstantially in the achievements of our nation. We are proud of all of them.\n\nTo conclude, I would like to say that the biggest challenge in running a\nGovernment is to ensure that development programmes are implemented\nin an effective manner. We will ensure that our outlays of expenditure are\nvisible to citizens as outcomes of progress. The Central Government, State\nGovernments and Panchayats have to work together so that the\nexpectations of people are fulfilled. If we have to achieve results, there is a\nneed to change the manner in which governments function. There is no\nspace in our government or in our society for corruption and arbitrary\naction. We are not prepared to tolerate this at any cost. Government\nservants must work with a sense of public service and they should be held\naccountable to the people. Governments will have to be made more\ntransparent and accountable. The recently passed Right to Information Act\nis a landmark step in this direction.\n\nIndia is on the road to progress. The whole world is watching us with\nexpectation. It is possible for us to eradicate poverty, ignorance and\ndisease within our lifetime. This has been made possible by the advances\nin science and technology.\n\nThere comes a time in the history of a nation when it can be said that the\ntime has come to make history. We are today at the threshold of such an\nera. The world wants us to do well and take our rightful place on the world\nstage. There are no external constraints on our development. If there are\nany hurdles, they are internal.\n\nWe must seize this moment and grab this opportunity. We need to have the\nresolve to make our country prosperous. We must have the self confidence\nto realise that we are second to none, that Indians are as good as the best.\nOur political system and leadership must show sagacity, wisdom and\nforesight so that we are able to make the best of this moment and make\nIndia a truly great nation.\n\nLet us come together, as one nation, strengthened by our plurality, to work\nshoulder to shoulder and build a new India. An India where there are no\nbarriers between the government and the people. An India where each and\nevery Indian can stand proudly and proclaim that he is an Indian. Let us\nwork together to build such a nation.\n\nDear children, join me and say \"Jai Hind\", \"Jai Hind\", \"Jai Hind\"."},{"year":2004,"pm":"Manmohan Singh","party":"INC","footnote":"Following is the free rendering of the Prime Minister's address to the nation, in Hindi, from the ramparts of the Red Fort on the 58th Independence Day, today:,","source":"PMO Archive","url":"http://archivepmo.nic.in/drmanmohansingh/content_print.php?nodeid=6&nodetype=2","text":"My dear countrymen, brothers, sisters, and dear children - Greetings to all\nof you on this day, the anniversary of our Independence.\n\nThis is a day we salute our Tiranga and feel pride and joy in watching it fly\nhigh in the blue sky. This is a day we remember and honour the leaders of\nour Freedom Movement for the struggle they waged under the inspiring\nleadership of Mahatma Gandhiji and for the victory they won against\nforeign rule. This is a day we thank our soldiers and security forces for their\nbravery and commitment. We salute them for their dedication and discipline\n- farmers, workers, teachers, professionals, scientists and our elected\nrepresentatives.\n\nIn every walk of life, each one of us contributes in our own way to the\nbuilding of our dear Bharat. What is that Bharat that we all wish to build?\n\nA Bharat that is just and humane.\n\nA Bharat that treats all its citizens as equals.\n\nA Bharat that is prosperous.\n\nA Bharat that lives in peace.\n\nA Bharat in which every person is literate and healthy.\n\nA Bharat in which everyone who seeks work is able to find it, and works for\na brighter future for all of us. My greetings to all of you.\n\nAs I stand here before you, I am reminded of the words of our first Prime\nMinister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, when he spoke to the Nation on the first\nanniversary of our Independence in 1948. At that time I was a young\nstudent, and looked upon the dawn of Independence as the opening up of\nnew vistas of opportunities to build an India of our dreams. Panditji had\nthen said, \"All of us talk of India and all of us demand many things from\nIndia. What do we give her in return?\" Panditji asked, and he said, \"India\nwill ultimately give us what we give her of love and service and productive\nand creative work. India will be what we are: our thoughts and actions will\nshape her.\"\n\nFriends, I ask each one of you to remember these wise words of Panditji as\nyou go about doing your work, be it on farms, in factories, in schools, in\ncolleges, in government offices, in shops, in research laboratories. Our\nNation is what we are. It will become what we make of ourselves.\n\nBrothers and sisters, it is one brick after another that helps make a building.\nMillions of bricks go to make a great building. In the same manner, the\nefforts of millions of people go into the formation of a nation. The process of\nnation building is a great enterprise of adventure and creativity. It requires\nall of us to work together, bonded by our love for our Motherland. This love\nflows from our identity as Indians. Whatever be our religion, region,\nlanguage, caste or culture, we are all Indians and India is ours.\n\nOur strength derives from our unity in diversity. The principles of\nsecularism, social justice and the equality of all before law are the defining\nfeature of our nation. Today is a day we re-dedicate ourselves to the\nservice of our Nation, and of each and every citizen, especially those less\nfortunate than us.\n\nThis day comes for us in the middle of the monsoons. Each year when we\nmeet here and see the Tiranga being unfurled on the Red Fort, we also\nlook at the clouds above and wonder whether it would rain. This year too\nwe have looked at the skies with anxiety.\n\nIn Andhra Pradesh I went to understand the problems of farmers, suffering\nfrom the impact of drought, and to hold the hands of the families that had\nlost their breadwinner due to the unbearable burden of debt. For miles\ntogether I could see no water. In Assam and Bihar I went to share the\nconcern of people whose lives have been dislocated by floods. For miles\nwithout end I could see only water. Drought and floods are two fundamental\nproblems that continue to bring suffering to our rural population. We need\nconcerted action to deal with these perennial problems.\n\nOur government has already taken some steps to deal with them. We\nintend to take more steps in future. We need to insulate our people from\nthe impact of drought by creating local level water security. We have to\nmobilize our people to come forward to take up the challenge of water\nconservation and management. We are committed to increasing public\ninvestment in irrigation and addressing the specific problems of each river\nbasin, in an environment and people friendly manner.\n\nWater is a national resource, and we have to take an integrated view of our\ncountry's water resources, our needs and our policies and water utilization\npractices. We need to ensure the equitable use of scarce water resources.\n\nThe waters of our sacred rivers have for centuries nurtured our civilization.\nThey are the threads that run through the fabric of our nation. We cannot\nallow these waters to divide us. I urge you and all our political leaders to\ntake a national and a holistic view of the challenge of managing our water\nresources.\n\nDealing with the problem of water is an important commitment we have\nmade as part of our \"New Deal for Rural India\". We have also taken steps\nto address the problem of availability and access to credit in rural areas.\nThe \"New Deal\" that rural India needs must encompass investment in\nirrigation, credit delivery, health care, availability of electricity, primary\neducation, rural roads and the modernization of the infrastructure for\nagriculture.\n\nWe must increasingly use modern science and technology to address the\nneeds of dry land farming, the diversification of our cropping pattern,\nmicro-irrigation and the quality of our livestock. Improving rural connectivity\nand access to information can enrich the farm community. Here\nGovernmental initiative can be multiplied by the effort of private enterprise\nand community action.\n\nFriends, more than three decades ago, Smt. Indira Gandhiji had given the\ncall \"Garibi Hatao\". We have reduced the incidence of poverty to some\nextent, but there is much more remaining to be done. While liberalizing and\nmodernizing our economy and enabling individual enterprise to blossom,\nwe must pay special attention to the elimination of poverty and the\nempowerment of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, Other Backward\nCastes and minorities. Our development strategies for tribal areas must be\nadequately sensitive to their felt needs and aspirations.\n\nThe empowerment of women is an important priority and the education of\nthe girl child is vital to it. Our children are our future. In framing our policies\nwe must keep the interests of future generations in mind. The Government\nwill pursue social and economic policies that are conducive to the proper\ngrowth and development of our children, investing in their education, health\nand nutrition. A healthy child makes a healthy nation.\n\nEmployment generation has not kept pace with demand for jobs.\nGovernment will address this deficiency in the growth process by\nencouraging the growth of small and medium enterprises, agro industries\nand sectors like tourism, where there is a high job potential. There is also\nan urgent need to provide employment in rural areas especially in areas\nsuffering from prolonged drought. The \"Food For Work Programme\" will be\nan important part of our strategy to deal with this challenge. New\ninvestment in the infrastructure sector will also help generate new jobs.\n\nOur approach has to be one of seeking faster growth while ensuring that\nthe benefits of growth are more evenly distributed. Our policies for higher\neconomic growth and modernization will be combined with an emphasis on\nsocial justice, communal harmony, rural development, regional balance and\nconcern for the environment.\n\nDear Countrymen, from the National Common Minimum Programme, I\nhave identified seven priority sectors for focused attention. These are\nagriculture, water, education, health care, employment, urban renewal and\ninfrastructure. These Seven Sectors (saat sutra) are the pillars of the\ndevelopment bridge we must cross to ensure higher economic growth and\nmore equitable social and economic development.\n\nThe concerns of most of our citizens revolve around what we do for\nagriculture, water, education, health and employment. We recognize that\nfor the development of the country what we are able to do in the key\ninfrastructure sectors like power, roads, railways, ports and airports is also\ncritical.\n\nThe plans and priorities of our government have been outlined in detail in\nthe National Common Minimum Programme, in my first address to the\nnation and in the Finance Minister's recent Budget speech. Today, I have\nno promises to make, but I have promises to keep.\n\nThe real challenge for me and for the Government at all levels is the\nchallenge of implementation of our stated policies and programmes.\nCentral, State and local bodies have to work together for Government to be\nan effective instrument of development for the benefit of our people. There\nare areas, in which the Government has to be actively engaged, like\neducation, health care, roads, railways, high technology and defence.\n\nHowever, for Government to be able to deliver results, we must reform the\nfunctioning of government. We have to make officials accountable - make\nGovernment more transparent. We have to make public enterprises more\nefficient. Citizens increasingly demand governments that are accountable\nto them. They have a concern both for probity and efficiency in public\naffairs.\n\nFellow Citizens, the question of ethics in public life has repeatedly agitated\nour people and we have tried to find Constitutional, legislative and\nadministrative devices to deal with the challenge. The time has come for us\nto consensually evolve a code of conduct for all political parties, a code of\nethics for all individuals in public life, and a code of best practices for the\nGovernment at all levels. On this solemn occasion let us resolve to work\ntogether to develop such a code of conduct in a consensual way so as to\nuphold the values enshrined in our Constitution.\n\nWe must also look within our parties, and ourselves and ask ourselves\nwhat is the root cause of the decline in values in public life? How do we\nreform our public institutions, our political parties, and our government at\nvarious levels? When we launched economic reforms over a decade ago,\nwe tried to liberate individual enterprise from the stranglehold of\nbureaucracy. We will continue to widen the space available for private\nenterprise and individual initiative.\n\nBut governments cannot be wished away, especially in a developing\ncountry like ours where the government has an important role to play. The\nchallenge for economic reform today is to breathe new life into government\nso that it can play a positive role where it must.\n\nBut what is government? Government comprises people's representatives\nand civil servants. The reform of government is, therefore, a reform of the\nway we, the elected representatives and officials, work in government. It is\nyou, fellow citizens, as members of the civil society, who must mobilize\nyour enormous resources in support of such reform. To make democratic\ninstitutions more accountable we are committed to take several steps to\nstrengthen the lowest tier of panchayats and urban local bodies. We need\nto build the capacity of decentralized bodies and their elected\nrepresentatives and this is best done through effective transfer of funds and\nfunctions to them.\n\nToday if we effectively utilize our decentralised system of governance\nthrough panchayat raj, we can take concerted action for more effective\ndelivery of basic services such as primary education, public health and\nhealth care, providing safe drinking water and sanitation.\n\nWhen we talk of reforming government and of Panchayat Raj we are\nreminded of Rajiv Gandhi who took pioneering initiatives in both these\nareas. Also, nearly twenty years ago, Rajiv Gandhi first drew the nation's\nattention to the newly emerging electronics and computer revolution then\nunderway. The enthusiastic manner in which the young people of our\ncountry have participated in the information technology revolution, turning\nIndia into an \"IT super power\", is a tribute to the farsightedness of Rajivji.\n\nIt is a matter of satisfaction today that IT is enabling us to improve the\nstandard of living of ordinary people even in remote areas. We will continue\nto explore ways in which modern technology can improve the lives of\nordinary people. We will improve broadband access and enable the\nrequired investment in IT infrastructure.\n\nWe live in an age where science and technology have become an\nimportant determinant of power and wealth. For our country to attain its due\nplace in the 21st century, it is necessary to integrate science and\ntechnology in to all our development processes. The promotion of scientific\ntemper must truly become a massive national movement.\n\nWe cannot make higher education a prisoner of either bureaucracy or\nideology. It must develop on the foundations of professional excellence and\nintellectual integrity. The pursuit of excellence and concern for social equity\nmust inform all our educational processes. The revered Dr. Ambedkar\nrecognized very early the importance of education in the empowerment of\nthe under-privileged. \"We may forego material benefits\", observed Dr\nAmbedkar, \"but we cannot forego our right and opportunities to reap the\nbenefit of the highest education to the fullest extent.\"\n\nDear Countrymen, ours is a vast country in which many States are as big\nas some countries of the world. For the benefits of development to reach all\ncorners of the country the Centre and States have to work in a spirit of\ncooperative federalism. It is the responsibility of the central government to\nhelp States to realize our common and shared objectives of development.\nBut, there is much that State and local governments can do to promote\ngrowth, social justice and welfare. They must raise the required resources\nto the extent feasible. Equally important, attention must also be paid to the\nquality and effectiveness of Government.\n\nI am concerned about the slow rate of growth of the backward regions, just\nas I am concerned about the economic distress of the less privileged\nsections of our society.\n\nWe will encourage new investment in less developed regions. We will help\nin strengthening developmental institutions there. Special attention must\ncontinue to be paid to governance and development in the North-Eastern\nStates and in Jammu and Kashmir. The pattern of development must be\nsuch as to create new opportunities for job creation so that the youth of\nthese regions can look to the future with renewed hope and confidence.\nThese regions of our country can benefit by improving rail and road\nconnectivity and encouraging new investment.\n\nBoth the North-East and Jammu and Kashmir are the most beautiful\nregions of our country. If we can work together to create an environment\nconducive to development and tourism, these regions will prosper more.\nPeace, social and political stability and communal harmony are essential\nfor economic development. People want such peace and stability so that\nthey can lead safe, secure and normal lives and go about their work, relax\nand enjoy life.\n\nWe must fight all anti-national and anti-social forces that try to disrupt\nnormal life. Be they terrorists or communal and other such divisive forces.\nTerrorism is a threat to our normal lives and we must all unite in fighting it.\nViolence has never helped in the progress and prosperity of any society.\nWe will fight this menace to civilized existence with determination. There\nshould be no doubts on this score. However, we are willing to talk to any\ngroup provided they abjure the path of violence.\n\nFriends, today I want each of you to show the same degree of\nself-confidence that our freedom fighters showed, when they led our\ncountry to freedom, in your encounters with new markets and new\nopportunities. We have been an open society. But, in being open to the\nworld, we have not lost our identity as a people. Again I remind you of what\nGandhiji taught us. That our nation must be like a house built on firm\nfoundations, whose windows are wide open to let the winds blow freely in\nevery direction.\n\n\"I want the winds from every corner to blow through my house\" Gandhiji\nsaid, \"but I refuse to be swept off my feet by any of them\". That has been\nour attitude to the world, culturally and economically, for centuries. We\nmust continue to adopt that attitude even as we seek to build a more self\nreliant and modern economy.\n\nIt is such focused attention to development that will address the real\nconcerns of our people today. It is by strengthening our economy and\nmaking our democracy more inclusive that we can walk tall in the comity of\nnations. It is because of our commitment to democracy and development\nthat we also wish to live in peace in our neighbourhood and with the world\nas a whole.\n\nAs a people we have always lived in peace with our neighbours in Asia and\nthe Indian Ocean region. For centuries we welcomed with open arms both\ntravellers and traders from different parts of the world. We ourselves set\nsail in search of markets and to spread the philosophies of our wise men.\nEven today we want to live in a neighbourhood of peace and prosperity.\n\nI assure our armed forces and security forces our unstinted support to their\nwelfare and to the modernization of our defences. They have played an\nadmirable role in the defence of our unity and integrity. Not only have they\ndefended our frontiers but also at home they have readily helped whenever\ntheir services have been sought in rescue and relief operations and in the\nprotection of the life and property of fellow Indians.\n\nEven as we devote our attention to defence, we must pay heed to the\nneeds of development. All our neighbours are, like us, developing countries\nwhose priority will also have to be the improvement of the quality of life of\ntheir citizens. We are not only bound together by our common borders but\nalso by our common destiny. The assurance of peace and prosperity in our\nneighbourhood is an important priority for us. Our Government will give the\nhighest priority to building closer political, economic and cultural ties with all\nour neighbours.\n\nWe have always been in favour of a purposive bilateral dialogue with\nPakistan to resolve all outstanding issues. It is our intention to carry forward\nwith firm resolve and sincerity the composite dialogue process with\nPakistan. The edifice of peace that we wish to build must stand on the twin\npillars of mutual trust and confidence. Of course, trends of cross-border\nterrorism and violence make our task more difficult and complex.\n\nAs far as our relations with China are concerned, the positive trends which\ncommenced with Shri Rajiv Gandhi's visit to China in 1988, have provided\na sound basis for later trends in our bilateral ties. We are committed to\nstrengthening and expanding these relations. We shall carry forward the\nprocess of discussion to resolve the boundary question with political vision\nand a practical approach.\n\nWe value the friendship of all nations, big and small and we will seek closer\neconomic relations with all countries. As a democratic country of more than\na 100 crore people we are destined to play an important and positive role in\nworld affairs, in structuring a just international order.\n\nAs a people, Indians have contributed a great deal to the advancement of\nknowledge. We value the positive role that the people of Indian origin have\nplayed in other countries. People of Indian origin are our cultural\nambassadors wherever they live. We value their contribution to the\nsocieties they now live in just as much as we value the contribution they\nmake to India, the land of their ancestors. Indians abroad are our \"Brain\nBank\". They have shown how enterprising we Indians can be if the\nenvironment is conducive. If the required infrastructure is provided and\nindividual initiative is rewarded we can be as good as the best in the world.\n\nAt home, this is the challenge for our Government. To create the\nenvironment in which merit is recognized, hard work and creativity are\nrewarded.\n\nMy dear countrymen, brothers and sisters, there are many things we must\ndo in government to be able to meet your needs and fulfill your aspirations.\nThis is a responsibility we have taken upon ourselves and as your\nrepresentatives in government we are ultimately answerable to you. This is\nthe essence of a democracy and I have accepted this responsibility with all\nhumility.\n\nThe power of the people, however, is infinitely greater than the power of\ngovernments. But, it is by combining the two that we can make our nation\ntruly great. However, as I have said already, there are limits to how much\nthe government can do. Part of the solution lies in each one of us, in our\nfamilies, in our communities. If we can all cooperate with one another and\nwork together as a community there is much we can do without looking for\nintervention by the government. We have to revive the spirit of community\nservice and the spirit of nationalism, especially among our youth.\n\nOur national movement is unique in world history because we secured our\nfreedom through non-violent means and by igniting hope in the minds of\nordinary people. Generations of young people have been inspired by the\nMahatma, a frail and soft-spoken man who shook the foundations of the\nmighty British Empire.\n\nI want our youth to understand Mahatma Gandhiji's message that each one\nof us has the power to do good for our nation if we are only so determined.\nLet us all work together to revive that spirit of idealism, self-sacrifice,\ndiscipline and unity of purpose that characterized our freedom struggle. I\nam confident that the people of this great nation have the will,\ndetermination and the resources to meet this challenge. India's destiny\nbeckons us to pool all our wisdom, experience and knowledge to make this\nfuture happen.\n\nI am confident that this is possible and within our reach. Our government\nwill do all that lies within its power to convert this dream into a living reality\nso that this ancient land of Bharat once again becomes a major\npowerhouse of both knowledge and creativity. I commit our government to\nthe fulfillment of this sacred national task.\n\nDear Children, join me now and say: Jai Hind! Jai Hind! Jai Hind!"},{"year":2003,"pm":"A.B.

The Tricolor is a symbol of our freedom, of our self-respect, and of\nsacrifices and martyrdom.\n\nPeople belonging to the older generations would certainly remember the\ntime when young boys and girls would form themselves into small groups,\ntake the flag in their hands, and go around villages and city streets singing,\nVijayi Vishwa Tiranga Pyara, Jhanda Uncha Rahe Hamara. (May our\nbeloved and victorious Tricolor fly high in the world.)\n\nToday we bow our heads in homage to the memory of all the leaders,\nfighters, and martyrs of our Freedom Struggle.\n\nMy greetings to all the jawans of the three Armed Forces and to the\nsecurity personnel. We gratefully remember those brave soldiers who laid\ndown their lives while guarding our frontiers or in the battle against\nterrorism.\n\nThis year the festival of freedom has arrived bringing the message of good\nrains in most parts of the country. We hope that the areas, which have not\nyet received adequate rainfall, would do so.\n\nThe last year went by in grappling with the crisis of drought. We assisted all\nthe drought-hit areas to the fullest extent, sent adequate foodgrains there,\nand ensured that there was no hunger anywhere. We also took care of the\nmute cattle.\n\nFelicitations to our farmers, who with their hard work, have filled the\ngranaries in the country.\n\nFelicitations to our industrious workers, skilled managers, and far-sighted\nbusinessmen, whose successes have attracted the attention of the entire\nworld. Today, India’s economy has grown to be the fourth largest in the\nworld.\n\nGreetings to all scientists, teachers, litterateurs, artistes, and to dear\nchildren.\n\nFelicitations to all the people of Indian origin living abroad. They have made\na remarkable contribution to raising India’s stature in the world. We are\nproud of them.\n\nToday, we offer our salutations to Mother India, whose children we all are.\nWhatever be our religion, caste, region, or language, we all are one. This\nunity is our strength.\n\nWe should cherish the diversity that underpins this unity. But we must,\nunder all circumstances and at any cost, keep our national unity and\nintegrity intact. This is the most important message of Independence Day.\n\nSisters and brothers, this is the sixth consecutive time that I have been\nspeaking to you from the ramparts of this historic Red Fort. This has been\npossible only because of your affection and support.\n\nThe dream of India as a great nation, which we had seen during the\nFreedom Struggle, continues to inspire us even today. To some extent, this\ndream has been realized. Yet, a lot more remains to be accomplished.\n\nDespite all the hardships, and braving all the challenges in these fifty-six\nyears, India is standing in the world with her head held high.\nThe nation’s security is supreme to us. India cannot be dependent on\nothers for her security. Therefore, the first act of my Government five years\nago was to make India, for her self-defence, a nuclear weapons state.\n\nThe world is changing. New challenges are emerging before us. We have\nto make India stronger both economically and socially.\n\nIn the past five years, India’s prestige in the world has gone up, thanks to\nour pro-active foreign policy. The international community’s way of looking\nat us has undergone a big change. The world is now recognizing India:\n\nAs the world’s largest democracy;\nAs an emerging global economic power;\nAs the confluence of a modern nation and an ancient civilization;\nAs a powerful country, dedicated to the ideal of peace.\nSisters and brothers, it is our policy to establish friendly and cooperative\nrelations with all our neighbors. We believe in resolving all disputes\npeacefully. Our frequent initiatives to normalize relations with Pakistan are\nnot a sign of our weakness; rather, they are an indication of our\ncommitment to peace.\n\nIn recent months, there has been some progress in normalizing relations\nwith Pakistan. Nevertheless, terrorist activities are still continuing. The test\nof our neighbour’s sincerity lies in whether he is prepared to stop\ncross-border terrorism totally.\n\nWe hope that Pakistan abjures its anti-India outlook. The people of both\ncountries wish to live in peace.\n\nI have been telling our Pakistani friends that we have spent fifty years\nfighting. How much more blood is yet to be spilt? The two of us need to\nfight against poverty, against unemployment, and against backwardness.\nWe should increase trade and economic links between our two countries.\nWhen we share a two thousand kilometer long border, it makes no sense\nfor us to trade via a third country.\n\nLet people travel to and fro. Let more and more elected representatives\nvisit each other’s country. Let us expand bilateral cultural relations.\n\nLet us open some new doors, new windows, and new light-holes in the\nwalls that divide us.\n\nThe love that the two-year-old girl Noor from Lahore received in India\ncarries a message, which our friends in Pakistan should understand.\n\nOn the occasion of Independence Day of both our countries, I invite\nPakistan to walk together with India on the road to peace. This road is\ndecidedly bumpy. There are even mines strewn along this path. Yet, once\nwe start walking, we will find the hurdles getting out of our way.\n\nI had gone to Srinagar a few months back. I’m going there again at the end\nof this month. The atmosphere there is changing.\n\nLast year, from the ramparts of this very Red Fort, I had declared that\nelections in the State would be held on time, and that they would be free\nand fair. Not everybody believed in it then. But, we fulfilled our promise.\n\nThe free elections there have yet again demonstrated the fact that the\npeople of Kashmir have rebuffed terrorism from across the border.\n\nThe people of Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh have faith in democracy. They\nwant peace. They would like to see happiness return to their lives.\n\nThose people who, while talking about Kashmir, advocate the right to\nself-determination, wish to divide India on communal lines for the second\ntime. They will not be allowed to succeed in this.\n\nThis year, more than one lakh tourists went to Kashmir. There was a large\nturnout of pilgrims going on the Amarnath yatra. Nearly six thousand\nstudents from different parts of India are today studying in Kashmir. Next\nweek, we shall launch mobile telephone services in the State.\n\nThe knotty issues in Jammu and Kashmir can be unraveled only through\ndialogue. We shall take forward the efforts that have been initiated in this\ndirection. People who have been uprooted have to be resettled in their\nhomes.\n\nDear Countrymen, the progress that India has made in recent years has\ngiven me new hope and confidence.\n\nAn India, which was used to borrowing from abroad has started lending to\nothers.\nAn India that was perennially troubled by a paucity of foreign exchange,\nhas today accumulated nearly US $ 100 billion of foreign exchange\nreserves.\nThe prices of essential commodities are under control. There is no\nshortage of anything in the market.\nPoverty is declining. It is our resolve to eradicate it faster.\nThere are no waiting lists now for telephone or gas connections. The\nnumber of mobile phone users has gone up from 8 lakh to 1.5 crores. In the\ncoming year, 1.5 crore more mobile customers will be added.\n\nWe are all aware of the poor condition of our roads. Even fifty years after\nIndependence, there were nearly two lakh villages, which were\nunconnected by proper roads. For the first time, the Centre has started the\nPradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana to connect them with good roads.\n\nIn the first five decades of Independence, only 550 kilometers of four-lane\nhighways were built. In other words, only 11 kilometers a year. Now, we will\nbuild 24,000 kilometers of highways at the rate of 11 kilometers a day.\n\nThe Rs. 54,000-crore National Highways Development Project is\nprogressing rapidly. Three lakh people are working on it everyday. Next\nyear, this number will go up to six lakh per day.\n\nLakhs of young Indians have got attractive employment in the field of\ncomputers. Sitting in our cities, they are providing services to hospitals,\nfactories, and offices in various countries. Software exports have zoomed\nfrom Rs. 8,000 crore to nearly Rs. 50,000 crore.\n\nOur country is now ready to fly high in the field of science. I am pleased to\nannounce that India will send her own spacecraft to the moon by 2008. It is\nbeing named Chandrayaan I.\n\nWe have increased the amount of lending to agriculture and related\nsectors. Interest rates have been reduced. We shall soon constitute a\nNational Kisan Commission to encourage new experiments in farming,\npromote investments in agriculture, and study the various problems faced\nby our farmers.\n\nThe Green Revolution and the White Revolution of previous decades have\nimparted much strength to Indian agriculture. Now India needs a new\nrevolution: the Food Chain Revolution. Its aim is to achieve a doubling of\nthe average income of the Indian farmer by 2010. An important part of this\nrevolution is to reduce wastage of foodgrains, fruits and vegetables worth\nthousands of crores each year.\n\nBased on the success of Kisan Credit Cards, we have decided to provide\ncredit card facility to all eligible artisans, weavers, and fishermen. The rate\nof interest on loans given to them will be reduced to 9 percent a year. A\ncontributory insurance scheme will also be started for their benefit.\nUnder the Antyodaya Anna Yojana, 1.5 crore poorest families in the\ncountry are being given 35 kilos of foodgrains each month at the rate of Rs.\n2 a kilo of wheat and Rs. 3 a kilo of rice. Never before were foodgrains\nprovided at such cheap prices. This is the largest food security program in\nthe world.\n\nWith the launch of the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, no child, especially the girl\nchild, will be deprived of primary education. To implement this program\neffectively, 2.5 lakh new teachers will be appointed this year itself.\n\nThe Mid-Day Meal Scheme for children up to class five is going on in some\nStates. Now, we have decided to run it throughout the country. Later, this\nwill be extended to students up to class ten. This National Program will be\nknown as ~Akshaypatra~. I appeal to voluntary organizations, religious\nestablishments and women’s self-help groups to come forward to\nimplement this program in an effective way.\n\nI know what people in under-developed States have to suffer due to the\nlack of good hospital services there. Therefore, under the Pradhan Mantri\nSwasthya Suraksha Yojana, six new hospitals with modern facilities, like\nthose available at AIIMS in Delhi, will be established in backward States in\nthe next three years.\n\nFriends, for decades a debate was going on about a project to link our\nrivers, as a way of freeing India from the curse of floods and droughts. Now\nwe have taken up this challenge. I am pleased to inform you that work on\ntwo river-linking projects, with the cooperation of State Governments, will\nbe taken up before the end of this year. We will mobilize necessary\nresources for these projects.\n\nNever before had housing construction taken place at the kind of speed\nwitnessed in the past five years. Never before were housing loans available\nat such low rates as now. Lakhs of people have got employment in the\nhousing sector.\n\nIndia has limitless potential in tourism. Take the case of this historic Red\nFort itself. It has been taken up for comprehensive restoration for the very\nfirst time in its 350 years. I can see that a beautiful garden is coming up in\nthe ground in front of me. It can be befittingly called the ~August 15 Park~.\n\nI would like you too to emulate this example by undertaking such beautiful\nprojects for the conservation of heritage in your own village or town.\n\nThe over-riding objective of our policy of economic reforms is just this: We\nwant to create a dynamic economy that not only succeeds against global\ncompetition, but is also caring and compassionate towards the poor and\nthe neglected.\n\nWe express our condolences for those who have become victims of\nuntimely death in recent mishaps and natural calamities.\n\nSisters and brothers, the hands of young Indians are today scripting India’s\nbright future. An ancient nation with a history of several thousand years has\nonce again become a Young Nation and is all set to create a new history.\n\nToday, in this nation of a 100 crore people, 60 crore are less than thirty\nyears old. This generation is better educated than any generation in the\npast, and more ambitious than any generation in the past. It is a generation\nthat has made up its mind not to fall behind anyone in the world in this age\nof competition.\n\nToday, the doors of opportunity are opening up for our young people all\nover the world. These opportunities will only increase in the coming years\nand decades. Therefore, we should educate our youth in science,\ntechnology and other new disciplines from now itself.\nI appeal to all, that we listen to the heartbeats of this Young India; that we\nunderstand the dreams of this Young India; that we encourage this Young\nIndia in every way possible; and, that we give proper guidance to this\nYoung India.\n\nCountrymen, today there is a paramount need that we maintain peace in\nour society and strengthen the bonds of brotherhood. Development\nrequires peace, goodwill and mutual cooperation. Those who wish to divide\nthe society on the basis of religion, caste or community are doing harm to\nthe country.\n\nIndia is a multi-religious nation. It is against both its nature and culture to\npractice discrimination or to do injustice to anybody on the grounds of faith.\nWe should always care for the minorities and be attentive towards their\nwelfare.\n\nPeace talks in the North-Eastern States are yielding positive results. The\nhands that took up the gun now wish to participate in the development of\ntheir region. The Government is ready to welcome them.\n\nFriends, it is our responsibility, the responsibility of the Government as well\nas of the society, that we provide equal opportunities to our brethren\nbelonging to the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Backward\nClasses and make them partners in the system. To ensure that economic\nand social justice fully reaches them is not only our Constitutional duty but\nalso our moral obligation.\n\nWe have removed the difficulties that had cropped up in the proper\nimplementation of the policy on reservations. Untouchability in our society\nis on the decline. However, we have to completely remove this blot.\n\nWe have established a new ministry for the development of Adivasis. We\nhave also set up a separate Commission for them. For the first time in fifty\nyears, the list of Scheduled Tribes has been revised and over a hundred\nnew communities have been added to the list.\n\nFriends, after the experience so far, I have come to the conclusion that\nthere is an imperative need for greater commitment and accountability in\nour system of governance, which has the responsibility of implementing\npolicies and decisions. There is delay in government offices even for\ngetting the right work done. Delays breed corruption.\n\nMy Government is prepared to fight corruption at all levels. We have\ndecided to enact the Lok Pal Bill, which had been pending for several\ndecades. In spite of opposition from some people, I have personally\nbrought the Prime Minister within the ambit of its investigation, so that you\ncan even book your Prime Minister if he commits any wrong.\n\nStringent steps are being taken against economic offenders.\n\nSisters and brothers, the Government of the National Democratic Alliance\nhas completed five years. All the previous experiments in running coalition\nGovernments at the Centre had failed. We have succeeded.\n\nToday there is a tremendous hunger for development among the people.\nThey want such a stable government which is determined to improve their\nliving conditions and also capable of doing so.\n\nIn our polity today, there is, on the one hand, a growing trend towards\nwanting to work together, but, on the other hand, there is also a scenario of\ndisarray.\n\nOur States have governments of different political parties. The Centre has\nestablished cooperative relations with them. Political discrimination on\naccount of ideological differences is unacceptable to us.\nThe proposal to reserve 33% seats for women in Parliament and State\nLegislatures, as a means of women’s empowerment, has now become a\nnational resolve. Today, there are over 10 lakh women members in our\npanchayats and municipal bodies. I congratulate them for their good work.\n\nHowever, it is regrettable that it has become difficult to pass the Bill for\nWomen’s Reservation in its original form because of a lack of consensus in\nParliament.\n\nNow a new proposal has been brought forward that seeks to create 33%\ndouble- member seats, in which one of them is reserved for women. This is\na practical suggestion. All the supporters of women’s reservation should\nconsider it with a positive outlook. If there is any other suggestion on which\na consensus is possible, the same should be implemented. There should\nbe no further delay in realizing this goal, for which our sisters have been\nwaiting for a long time.\n\nDear Countrymen, today the nation is at such a turning point from where it\ncan take a big leap forward. The yearning to achieve the lofty vision of\nmaking India a Developed Nation by 2020 is gathering strength all over the\ncountry.\n\nIn just one generation, India can be liberated from the curse of poverty,\nunemployment and underdevelopment. This is not a daydream. It can be\nturned into reality. Many countries in the world have demonstrated it.\n\nLook behind a little. India has marched forward by overcoming many a\nformidable crisis. Today, when the era of resurgence has arrived, why\nshould there be any doubt in anyone’s mind?\n\nWhat is needed is only this:\nThat all of us move together.\nThat all of us move with discipline.\nThat we adopt a new work culture.\nThat we work with a long-term perspective.\nWhen this ancient and great nation combines talent and hard work, and\nstrives its utmost in pursuit of a common vision, it will certainly succeed in\nbuilding a bright future for itself.\n\nNearly 40 years ago I had written a poem, from which I would like to\npresent a few lines to you.\n\nTogether, we have to march\n\nObstacles will come, let them.\n\nDark clouds of apocalypse will gather, let them.\n\nEven if embers smolder under our feet,\n\nOr flames rain over our heads,\n\nSmilingly, we shall light the fire\n\nWith our own hands, and burn,\n\nBut together, we have to march.\n\nIn laughter or in grief, in hurricanes,\n\nIn immortal sacrifices beyond count,\n\nIn greens or in ruins,\nIn insults or in accolades,\n\nIn pain, too,\n\nWe have to thrive\n\nHeads held high, hearts swelled with pride.\n\nTogether, we have to march.\n\nThank you.\n\nSisters, brothers and dear children, join me in saluting:\n\nJai Hind! Jai Hind! Jai Hind!"},{"year":2002,"pm":"A.B.

Lots of love to you, and\nmy blessings.\n\nMembers of India’s Diaspora, living in distant lands of the world, my good\nwishes to all of you. You may be far away from India, but you are always\nclose to our hearts.\n\nI wish to congratulate all our sportspersons, who did India proud in the\nrecent Commonwealth Games. In particular, our women who have shown\nthat they are in no way behind men. I am confident that Indian\nsportspersons will earn similar success in the Olympic Games.\n\nSisters and Brothers,\n\nIt is fifty-five years since we became independent. Today, we pay our\nhomage to all the martyrs of the Freedom Struggle. We bow our heads\nbefore Mahatma Gandhi, Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, and all other great\nleaders.\nWe salute our soldiers, jawans of paramilitary forces, and police personnel\nwho laid down their lives in combating terrorism.\n\nOur tributes also to the martyrs who foiled the terrorist attack on our\nParliament on December 13.\n\nTerrorism has become a festering wound. It is an enemy of humanity.\n\nOur neighbour claims to oppose terrorism at the international level, but\nadopts double standards in the context of our region. After facing defeat in\nwars, it has resorted to cross-border terrorism for grabbing Kashmir.\n\nWe wish to state once again that Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of\nIndia. It will remain so.\n\nThe world cannot accept that the cruel massacre of the Amarnath pilgrims,\nor the carnage of innocent women and children at Kaluchak and Kasim\nNagar are a part of any ~Freedom Struggle~.\n\nFor us, Kashmir is not a piece of land; it is a test-case of Sarva Dharma\nSamabhava, secularism. India has always stood the test of a secular\nnation. Jammu and Kashmir is a living example of this. And this itself is\nKashmiriyat.\n\nWe shall defeat cross-border terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir. This is our\nresolve.\n\nWe wish to have good neighborly relations with Pakistan. The Lahore\nJourney and the Agra Summit are a testimony to this.\n\nIndia wants all issues to be resolved peacefully and through negotiations.\nWe are prepared to take some more steps in this direction. However, for\nthis, it is necessary to create a conducive environment.\nInfiltration into Jammu and Kashmir continues even today. Those who call\nthe forthcoming elections in the State farcical should not give us lectures on\ndemocracy. Let them take a look at their own track record.\n\nHow can attempts to flagrantly provoke the people of Jammu and Kashmir\nto boycott elections create an atmosphere for any meaningful talks. Instead\nof resolving problems, this will only exacerbate them.\n\nSisters and Brothers,\n\nI am deeply saddened when I compare South Asia with other parts of the\nworld. When Japan, which was devastated in the Second World War, today\nstands as one of the front-ranking nations; when the whole of Europe has\nunited, forgetting all the old enmities; why can’t we resolve all our\ncontentious issues through talks?\n\nWe can. We will.\n\nWhy can’t we unite and fight against our real enemy, the poverty?\n\nThis is a challenge. No one is going to come from outside and meet it for\nus.\n\n***\n\nThe process of peace and democracy has now arrived at a decisive turn in\nJammu and Kashmir, which has been grappling with terrorism.\n\nElections are going to take place in the State. The dates have already been\nannounced.\n\nI am confident that these elections will be fully free and fair. No one need\nhave any doubts on this score.\n\nI appeal to the people of Jammu, Kashmir, and Ladakh, as also to their\nrepresentatives to participate actively and in large numbers in the elections\nand thereby demolish the motivated propaganda being conducted from\nacross the border.\n\nNo one will be allowed to create disturbances in the elections in Jammu\nand Kashmir. All the designs to create an atmosphere of fear will be\nfrustrated.\n\nThe people of Jammu and Kashmir want to live in peace. For many many\nyears they have seen and suffered violence and bloodshed. They want to\ncreate a future for their children.\n\nMy brothers and sisters in Jammu and Kashmir, today is an opportunity\nwhen we can together heal these wounds. Together, we can participate in\nthe creation of a happy Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nI would like that no citizen of the State feels alone and helpless. The entire\nNation is with them.\n\nI am confident that all the displaced people, including Kashmiri Pandits, will\nbe able to go back to their homes with respect, in the new situation that will\nbe created after the elections.\n\nI wish to assure the people of Jammu and Kashmir that if any mistakes\nhave occurred, we shall make amends. For this, we shall talk to the elected\nrepresentatives and organizations. Discussions will also take place on the\ndemand for more powers to the State.\n\n***\nThe desire for peace is growing in India’s North-Eastern States too. The\ndemand for faster economic development is intensifying.\n\nPeople are realizing the fact that the gun can snatch away life, but it cannot\nmake people’s lives better.\n\nOur efforts for permanent peace in Nagaland are progressing towards\nsuccess. We invite all those who have taken to the path of violence in other\nNorth-Eastern States for peace talks.\n\nSisters and Brothers,\n\nIn addition to external difficulties, we also have had to grapple with nature.\nA large part of the country is reeling under a severe drought. In some\nplaces, floods have shown their wrath.\n\nStanding crops are wilting, sown seeds have gone bad. Kisans are\nconcerned. We share their concern.\n\nThe Government has taken every possible step to deal effectively with the\ndrought. Our godowns are brimming with foodgrains. We will not let anyone\ndie of hunger.\n\nRelief is being reached to the weaker sections of society by extending the\nscope of the Antyodaya Anna Yojana. Under the Rs. 10,000-crore\nSampoorna Grameen Rozgar Yojana, drought relief programmes are being\nspeedily implemented. Five thousand crore rupees have been given to\nStates to undertake various ~Food-for-Work~ activities.\n\nPrices of essential goods are under control.\n\nBut all these are temporary measures.\nThe Government is now preparing an effective, long-term strategy to\nprotect the country from the curse of drought and floods.\n\nWe will make concerted efforts to save every drop of water. We will have to\nadopt watershed management, rainwater harvesting, and all such\ntechniques.\n\nWe will shortly unveil a new initiative, which will be called Pradhan Mantri\nGrameen Jal Samvardhan Yojana.\n\nWe shall soon start three important programmes:\n\nOne lakh hand-pumps will be installed in water-scarce areas;\n\nOne lakh primary schools in rural areas will be provided with drinking water\nfacilities; and,\n\nOne lakh traditional sources of drinking water will be revived.\n\nDear Countrymen,\n\nWith your trust, affection, and support, I am in front of you for the fifth\nconsecutive year on the ramparts of Red Fort.\n\nThere is stability in the country today. People want the experiment of\ncoalition governance to succeed.\n\nDemocracy has become stronger. Its roots have reached every village and\ntown. After Independence, thirteen elections to the Lok Sabha have taken\nplace. Governments have been formed and changed, but always without\nany bloodshed and violence.\n\nMy Government is committed to carrying out electoral reforms. It is our firm\nresolve to keep criminal elements away from power.\n\nDear Countrymen,\n\nToday, India stands proudly on the world stage: tall, self-reliant, and full of\nself-confidence. Our prestige is on the rise internationally.\n\nIt is necessary that we do not overlook our achievements. Undoubtedly, our\nprogress in certain areas has been tardy. We have to honestly introspect\non this. For, we have the potential to achieve much more than what we\nhave achieved so far.\n\nSometimes, we tend to talk about our shortcomings much more than is\nnecessary. This gives rise to disappointment. The Nation’s energy\ndissipates.\n\nOn the other hand, the feeling of national pride inspires us to work to\nachieve more.\n\nWe are proud of our kisans. Until a few years ago, we had had to import\nfoodgrains from abroad. Last year, we exported foodgrains worth Rs. 6,400\ncrore.\n\nWe are proud of our scientists and engineers. They successfully launched\ninto space not only Indian satellites, but also satellites of other countries.\n\nWe are proud of our entrepreneurs in the computer industry. Could anyone\nhave even imagined that one day, India would earn Rs. 40,000 crore in\ncomputer software exports? But it has happened.\n\nBehind these achievements, is the talent, the hard work, and the\ndetermination of us Indians. The credit for this goes especially to the youth\nof our country. Come, let us congratulate our younger generation for this.\nSisters and Brothers,\n\nWe have a multi-party system. The race for power is natural in this system.\nHowever, this race has to remain within the limits of the ~Nation First~\nprinciple.\n\nWe will have to draw a Lakshman Rekha in our political conduct. This must\nnever be crossed for temporary gains.\n\nToday, there is consensus among political parties on issues of national\nsecurity. Then, why can’t we create a similar consensus on certain pressing\nissues of social and economic development?\n\nWe can create this consensus. We must create this consensus.\n\nTake for example, the problems in the power sector. The scarcity of\nelectricity has assumed crisis proportions in many States.\n\nI appeal to all political parties to arrive at a consensus on the minimum\nagenda for power sector reforms.\n\nHowever, it is not enough to change the mindset of political parties. It is\nalso necessary to bring about a change in the mindset of the people.\n\nJust think of the extensive theft of power, and of the Rs. 25,000 crore that\nis lost through it every year. How can this be tolerated?\n\nToday, kisans want quality power; they are willing to pay more if the power\nsupply is uninterrupted. But there should be no interruptions and cuts and\nno impediments in its transmission to the desired destinations.\n\nCountrymen,\nThe economic reforms that have been implemented in the past few years\nare in front of you. An economy of scarcity has been transformed into an\neconomy of surplus.\n\nToday, there are no crowds in front of ration shops.\n\nThere are no lines for gas and telephone connections\n\nThe queues for kerosene have become shorter.\n\nPrices of vegetables may have risen in rainy season, but we have strived to\nkeep onion prices in check!\n\nTelecom and Internet services are available to more and more people.\nTheir rates too are continuously falling.\n\nOur chief objective of economic reforms has been to remove poverty\nspeedily. We are moving rapidly in this direction. The living standards of the\ncommon man are rising. Today, a fan, a TV, a refrigerator, or a scooter can\nbe seen even in poor localities.\n\nMy dream is to see that every family has its own house. In the past four\nyears, we have initiated the process of construction of nearly sixty lakh new\nhouses. Of these, 35 lakh houses are in rural areas and eighty percent are\nfor poor families.\n\nI dream of an India in which both the Government and Society are\nsensitive. Our policies and programmes have been formulated with this end\nin mind.\n\nBrothers and Sisters,\nFaster development of the infrastructure in our country is the need of the\nhour. We are fully determined to ensure that this happens.\n\nA network of world-class highways is being laid across the country. The\nNational Highways Development Project is being implemented rapidly. Rs.\n55,000 crore will be spent on it. This is the biggest and most ambitious road\nproject to be implemented in India after Sher Shah Suri’s Grand Trunk\nRoad.\n\nSimilarly, the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana, costing Rs. 60,000\ncrore, will link every village with an all-weather road in five years.\n\nThese two road projects are generating jobs for lakhs of people.\n\nDear Countrymen,\n\nOur aim is to free India from the curse of poverty and unemployment. It is\nto make India a Developed Nation by 2020.\n\nWhen this country of one billion people works with a common resolve, then\nno goal is impossible to achieve.\n\nThe Tenth Plan has set the target of eight percent yearly growth in GDP.\n\nWe are taking some important new measures for economic and social\ndevelopment. These will be announced separately today.\n\nSisters and Brothers,\n\nI appeal to you to display the same emotional unity on the issue of National\nDevelopment as you always do on the issue of National Security.\n\nCome, let us make Development a powerful People’s Movement.\nFor this, it is necessary that everyone rises above casteism and\ncommunalism. We will have to leave behind all those things that divide us.\n\nThe horrific explosion of communal violence in Gujarat was one unfortunate\nexample of this. There can be no place for such violence in a civilized\nsociety.\n\nWe must maintain peace, communal amity, national unity and integrity\neven in the most serious and provocative of circumstances.\n\nIt is the responsibility of the Government and Society alike to provide\nsecurity and equal opportunities for the minorities.\n\nCountrymen,\n\nCome, let us as a nation look ahead, look to the future.\n\nSomeone has rightly said:\n\n~Beeti Tahi Bisar De, Aage Ki Sudh Le~\n\n(Forget what happened in the past, look forward to the future.)\n\nRather than getting bogged down in the issues and disputes of the past, let\nus create a new future for ourselves.\n\nAll our programmes will succeed and all our dreams for progress will come\ntrue only when we strictly adhere to probity and morality in public life.\n\nWe will not compromise with corruption at any level. Those who are in high\noffices should remember that people expect equally high conduct from\nthem.\nWhile on the one hand, there is a need for those in politics and\nadministration to change their behaviour, equally, our citizens need to\nchange their attitude.\n\nDo not talk only of your rights. Remember also your own duties and\nresponsibilities.\n\nThe mindset of depending on the Government for every work has to\nchange.\n\nI call upon all citizens and voluntary organizations to come forward for\nsocial work.\n\n***\n\nIt is our collective responsibility to ensure that Dalits, oppressed, and\npeople belonging to backward classes enjoy social justice and equality. We\ndo not do them any favour by doing this.\n\nMy Government has extended the period of reservations for scheduled\ncastes and scheduled tribes in government service for another ten years.\nTheir opportunities for promotion in government service have also been\nproperly ensured.\n\nThese reservations are not a dole, rather they are an instrument for\nbringing about social equality.\n\nMy dear countrymen,\n\nThis fifty-fifth anniversary of Independence conveys one more message to\nus. And that message is that all of us strive to our utmost for the realization\nof the dream of making India a Developed Nation.\nMay our goal be the limitless heights of the sky.\n\nMay our feet be on the ground.\n\nMay our minds be full of unyielding determination.\n\nMay our hands be clasped together.\n\nMay our resolve be to march together.\n\nIf we do this, our victory is certain.\n\nCome, let all of us unitedly affirm this resolve with the victorious salutation\nof Jai Hind.\n\nJoin me in saying thrice:\n\nJai Hind! Jai Hind!! Jai Hind!!!"},{"year":2001,"pm":"A.B.

I convey my\ngreetings to all of you. We are celebrating the 54th anniversary of our\nIndependence. Today, we pay our respectful homage to the martyrs of the\nFreedom Struggle. I would like to remember today all the great men and\nwomen of our Freedom Movement, especially Mahatma Gandhi and Netaji\nSubhas Chandra Bose. They inspire and illuminate our march in the new\ncentury.\n\nOn this occasion, I send my greetings to all the people of Indian origin living\nin different corners of the world.\n\nThis nation of 100 crore people, inheriting a five thousand year old\ncivilization, is today scripting an illustrious chapter in its history.\n\nDear friends,\n\nRemember the many hardships that we had to go through three years ago\nin the aftermath of the nuclear tests at Pokharan. Today, those difficulties\nare receding.\n\nWe faced those hardships for the sake of our national security, and we did\nso successfully. Today our relations with many important countries of the\nworld have grown stronger and deeper. We are engaged in a Strategic\nDialogue with them on a regular basis.\n\nIndia’s prestige has gone up globally.\n\nSisters and brothers,\n\nWe have always been strong votaries of world peace. For thousands of\nyears, we have been chanting the mantra of peace. — Prithvih Shantih,\nAntariksha Shantih, Vanaspatayah Shantih  — praying for peace on\nearth, in outer space, and also peace for all the flora and fauna.\n\nNaturally, we have always desired to have peaceful relations with all our\nneighbours. The entire world knows that India has left no stone unturned to\nimprove her relations with Pakistan. These efforts have been continuing\nright from the days of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru. Many Agreements and\nDeclarations were signed. But these have not helped to establish lasting\npeace.\n\nI, too, attempted to make a new beginning. I went to Lahore for peace.\n\nYet, despite having signed the Lahore Declaration, Pakistan committed an\narmed aggression at Kargil. Our jawans, with their bravery and heroism,\nthrew them out of our territory. I pay my tribute to all those soldiers who laid\ntheir lives in that conflict. I express my deep sympathies with their families\non this occasion.\n\nDespite Kargil and cross-border terrorism, we invited Pakistan’s President\nGeneral Pervez Musharraf for talks.\n\nI told my guest in Agra: ~We have been fighting for 50 years. For how\nmany years more, you intend to fight? This has helped neither Pakistan nor\nIndia. Because of the hostile relations, both our countries are spending a lot\nof their limited resources on wars and for preparing for wars, whereas we\nought to be spending these scarce resources on the development of our\ntwo countries and to improve the lives of our peoples.~\n\nI had also told him: ~If we have to fight, why don’t we wage a war against\npoverty, against unemployment, against disease, and against\nunderdevelopment.~\n\nWe know that the people of Pakistan yearn for peace with India.\nWe have to promote cooperation in trade, economics, and in other areas\nfor mutual benefit. We have to encourage greater people-to-people\ncontacts.\n\nUnfortunately, President Musharraf had no interest in improving our\nrelations in all possible areas. He came here with a single-point agenda —\nto make India accept Pakistan’s terms on Kashmir.\n\nI could not have accepted this condition.\n\nHe wanted us to forget the Shimla Agreement and the Lahore Declaration,\nand begin a new journey from Agra.\n\nI could not have accepted this too.\n\nHe kept on describing cross-border terrorism as ~jehad~ and ~freedom\nstruggle~.\n\nThere was simply no question of accepting this logic.\n\nAs we had expected, there has been a spurt in terrorist activities after the\nAgra Summit. There have been massacres of innocent people in Amarnath,\nKishtwar, Doda, Jammu and yesterday near Ghaziabad.\n\nWhat kind of jehad is this? What kind of freedom struggle is this? And, for\nwhom is this freedom struggle?\n\nThe activities of Pakistan-supported Jehadi organizations are napak\n(unholy). They are against the tenets of Islam and humanism.\n\nLet no one entertain any delusion that Pakistan can succeed in wresting\nKashmir, through jehad and terrorism, what it has failed to get through\nwars.\n\nAs far as the dialogue with Pakistan is concerned, India shall continue to be\nengaged in this process. Nevertheless, we shall not hesitate in the least to\ncrush Pakistan-sponsored terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nToday I wish to tell the people of Jammu, Kashmir, and Ladakh that we feel\nyour pain and agony. We have been making all efforts to remove it.\n\nWe shall intensify the efforts that we have been making to bring normalcy\nto the State and to bring the fruits of development to its people. Panchayat\nelections have been held in the State recently. The people of the Jammu\nand Kashmir will elect a new Assembly, after some time. We shall ensure\nfree and fair elections to the State Assembly.\n\nOn this occasion, I recall the couplets of the great Shayar-e-Kashmir,\nMehjoor. Its gist I would recall here:-\n\n‘The caste and land of you Kashmiris is the same. Do not unnecessarily let\nanything create a distance between you. If Muslim is milk, Hindu is sugar.\nMix this milk with this sugar’.\n\nThis Sufi ideology is the convergence point of Kashmir with the spiritual\ntradition of India. Kashmiriyat is a fine example of Sarva Dharma\nSamabhava (secularism). It completely negates the Two-Nation theory. We\nare indeed proud of this Kashmiriyat.\n\nThe situation in the North-Eastern States is a matter of special concern to\nus. Violence complicates problems; it does not solve them. It has created\nhurdles in the path of development of the North-East.\n\nToday I would like to reassure my sisters and brothers in the North-East\nthat the comprehensive peace process, that we have begun in the region,\nwill bear desired results.\n\nIndia is a vast nation. It is multi-lingual and multi-religious. It is full of myriad\ndiversities.\n\nThese diversities are not our weakness. Rather, they are our strength.\nThey showcase our cultural richness. In these diversities lie the powerful\nthreads of India’s unity.\n\nSisters and brothers,\n\nIndia is one of the ten fastest growing economies in the world. In terms of\nsize, India is counted among the four largest economies of the world.\n\nIndia has emerged as one of the front-ranking nations in the world in\ninformation technology, missile technology, and in many other areas.\n\nWhen I see young women and men, of the new generation handling high\nresponsibilities with aplomb, my faith in India’s future gets strengthened. It\nis these people who are making India a better place than before. They are\nthe architects of India’s strong and glorious tomorrow.\n\nNow we can truly take pride in being Indian. Indians can walk with their\nheads held high in the world.\n\nIn spite of the population having more than tripled in the past five decades,\nwe have been able to reduce the percentage of people living below the\npoverty line.\n\nIn the decade of the ‘90s, it has fallen from 36 percent to 26 percent.\n\nI do not claim that we have been able to eradicate poverty as rapidly as we\nshould, or could, have.\nBut I am confident that abject poverty is on its way out in India.\n\nIn the last decade, literacy in India has taken a quantum jump. I am\nconfident that in the current decade, India will more or less become\ncompletely literate.\n\nIt is true that India’s economy is currently going through a slowdown. But\nthis is a temporary phenomenon.\n\nThis is also a global phenomenon, and not limited to India alone.\n\nBut there is no need to get too worried on this score, because the\nfundamental indicators of India's economy are quite strong.\n\nPrices are stable. Inflation is under control. Foreign exchange reserves are\nat a record high. And, our godowns are bursting with foodgrains.\n\nBecause of good monsoon, there are bright prospects of the coming crops\non the economic front. Yesterday’s heavy rainfall had cast doubts that the\nmorning today will be full of dark clouds and the earth will be soaked with\nthe rain showers. But, this did not happen. Clouds have dispersed and the\nsun has come out. We can now forge ahead towards future. Good\nmonsoon has come with promising prospects on the economic front.\n\nWe have taken steps to increase investment in all the infrastructure areas,\nin industries, and in agriculture. We shall soon take more steps in this\ndirection. These will help in bringing the economic slowdown to an end.\n\nIn the past few years, natural calamities seem to have resolved to test\nIndia. Orissa was hit by a super-cyclone. In Gujarat there was a\ndevastating earthquake. Some parts of the country have faced severe\nfloods, and at some places there is drought. Now, the task of their\nrehabilitation is taking place on a large scale with the cooperation of all. We\nthank the foreign countries and are grateful to them for the speed with\nwhich they came forward with help. This symbolises that entire humanity is\none and if any of its part is suffering, then the entire body feels the pain. All\ntherefore should rush to extend help unitedly. Nevertheless, together we\nhave encountered these crises with great fortitude and solidarity and\nprovided relief to the affected.\n\nWe are going to put in place a permanent and institutional structure to\neffectively deal with such natural calamities.\n\nMy dear kisan brothers,\n\nYou are the country’s annadata.\n\nWith your hard work, you have not only made India self-sufficient in\nfoodgrains, but have produced a big surplus. Scarcity of foodgrains has\nbecome a thing of the past now. Earlier, we used to import food. Now, we\nare an exporter.\n\nToday, the Government’s godowns have a stock of more than 60 million\ntonnes of foodgrains. We are augmenting the storage capacity.\n\nI am well aware of the many problems that our farmers are grappling with.\nWe have been constantly trying to mitigate them. It has been our\nendeavour to ensure that the kisan gets fair and remunerative price for his\ncrops.\n\nSo far, more than one and a half crore farmers have been given Kisan\nCredit Cards.\n\nSome people have been expressing apprehensions that cheap farm\nimports will flood Indian markets because of our commitments to the WTO.\nThese have been proved false.\n\nWe are quite capable, depending on our needs, to impose or hike import\nduties and to check unfair imports. We have, in fact, done so in some\ncases.\n\nIt is true that a new scenario of world trade is emerging. This has presented\nmany challenges to Indian agriculture and to the rest of our economy. We\ncan — and we shall — face these challenges through collective and\ncoordinated action.\n\nI appeal to all our farmers, workers, managers, businessmen, scientists\nand researchers to prepare our economy to face global competition more\nvigorously. For this, our agriculture and industries have to constantly\nimprove their quality. They also have to significantly reduce their production\ncosts.\n\nFriends,\n\nThis year marks the decade of India's New Economic Policy.\n\nThis policy has brought many gains to our economy. At the same time,\nhowever, several new problems have also cropped up.\n\nIt is true that certain recent developments have highlighted some of the\nweaknesses in our financial and capital markets. This has made people\nfeel rather worried.\n\nWe have taken several steps to remove these weaknesses, and we shall\ntake more steps in the future.\n\nThe functioning of the stock markets and financial institutions will be\nreformed to protect the interests of small investors.\nProfits earned by hook or by crook cannot be the sole criterion for judging\nthe success of a business. The success of liberalization requires the steady\ndevelopment of a new corporate ethic.\n\nBrothers and sisters,\n\nSome cases of corruption and scandals have surfaced in recent times. We\ncannot turn a blind eye to corruption, nor can we let corruption proliferate. A\ncorrupt man must receive punishment for his deeds.\n\nI reassure you that corrupt elements will not be able to escape the long arm\nof the law, irrespective of how high a chair they may occupy. Only\nyesterday, a new Bill – Lok Pal Bill has been introduced in the Lok Sabha.\nThe Prime Minister has also been included in its ambit, if there are any\ncorruption charges against him. Our Government will not discriminate in\nany way in this regard and will not hesitate, if need be, in putting to trial any\nperson, however big or powerful he may be. We have already taken strong\naction in several cases.\n\nAt the same time, I wish to state that there is a need to refrain from giving\nbaseless allegations the color of a scandal. I know that most people in our\ncountry believe in earning their livelihood by honest means.\n\nDear Countrymen,\n\nThis year marks a decade of New Economic Policy of India. There is no\ndoubt that economic liberalization has benefited India. At the same time,\nthis too is true that the fruits of liberalization have not adequately reached\nthe poor and people living in rural areas. Inequalities have increased.\n\nTherefore, after serious introspection, my Government has decided to give\na new pro-poor, pro-village, and pro-employment orientation to our\neconomic policy.\n\nWe shall make necessary modifications in the policy to remove regional\nimbalances and social inequalities.\n\nWe are determined to ensure that the new economic policy becomes a\npromoter of social justice and that its benefits reach our brothers and\nsisters belonging to Dalit, Adivasi, backward, and most backward sections\nof our society.\n\nWe have unveiled several important schemes towards this end in the past\nthree years. In the same direction, we now propose to take some new\nmeasures: -\n\nThe Central Government will launch an ambitious new scheme of Rs.\n10,000 crore to provide additional and guaranteed employment in rural\nareas. This centrally sponsored scheme will be called the Sampoorna\nGrameen Rozgar Yojana.\n\nUnder this scheme, those who take employment from panchayats to build\ndurable rural assets will be paid wages in cash and in foodgrains. For this,\n50 lakh tonnes of foodgrains worth Rs. 5,000 crore will be provided to State\nGovernments every year. All the existing employment schemes of the\nCentral Government will be merged into this mega-scheme. Nearly one\nhundred crore mandays of employment are expected to be generated\nthrough the Sampoorna Grameen Rozgar Yojana.\n\nOur economy shows a strange paradox. Nearly all the savings of our\npeople are deposited in banks. The banks are unable to use these funds\nfully for developmental projects.\nOn the other hand, the unorganized sector of the economy does not get\nadequate bank credit. This sector constitutes two-thirds of our economy.\nThe loan repayment record of this sector is indeed better than that of big\nindustries. We are considering some institutional measures to make\nresources available to the unorganized businesses and industries.\n\nNeither faster development, nor people’s participation is possible without\ndecentralization. Which is why, two important amendments to the\nConstitution were enacted nearly ten years ago to empower the Panchayati\nRaj Institutions. However, we have so far not been able to devolve the\nnecessary powers to the Panchayati Raj Institutions to empower them\nfinancially and administratively in an adequate manner.\n\nThe Government will soon initiate a national debate to achieve this\nimportant objective, involving all the over thirty lakh elected representatives\nin Panchayati Raj institutions. We would like the Panchayats to fix their own\npriorities, prepare their own plans, and to implement them with the\nparticipation of the villagers. Towards this end, we shall devise new ways to\nenable Panchayati Raj institutions and non-governmental organizations\nengaged in rural developmental activities to avail loans from banks and\nother financial institutions for specific development projects.\n\nAll of us know that democracy and hunger cannot go together. We shall\ntherefore launch a National Nutrition Mission. Under this, subsidized\nfoodgrains will be made available to adolescent girls and expectant and\nnursing mothers, belonging to below-poverty-line families. Cheaper\nfoodgrains could also be provided to such religious, social, and educational\norganizations if they so require, that are engaged in mass-feeding\nprogrammes for the poor.\nFriends, India is urbanizing rapidly. As a result, there is a growing shortage\nof affordable housing for the urban poor. The Government has, therefore,\ndecided to launch Ambedkar – Valmiki Malin Basti Awas Yojana, to benefit\nespecially those belonging to the scheduled castes, scheduled tribes,\nbackward classes, and other weaker sections. The Ministry of Urban\nDevelopment will give a yearly grant of Rs. 1,000 crore to this project.\nHUDCO, which will implement this scheme, will make available another Rs.\n2,000 crore as a loan amount.\nThere is a shortage of three lakh housing units for the families of the\njawans in our Armed Forces. At the present rate of housing construction, it\nwill take thirty years for this shortage to end. We have decided to build\nthese three lakh housing units in the next four years.\n\nI had mentioned, in my Address to the Nation on Independence Day last\nyear, about the Pradhan Mantri Gramin Sadak Yojana. This is now being\nimplemented in almost all the States. So far, the Centre has made Rs.\n5,000 crore available for this project. This project would need Rs. 60,000\ncrore for completion. It is our aim to provide all-weather road connectivity to\nall villages and hamlets in the country, with a population of more than five\nhundred, by the end of the Tenth Five Year Plan in 2007.\n\nThe National Highways Development Project of Rs. 55,000 crore is one of\nthe ambitious projects of independent India. We shall further intensify the\nwork on this project. I am confident that these two major road connectivity\nprogrammes would create lakhs of new employment opportunities and also\ngive our economy a big boost.\n\nOur objective is Freedom from Distance. We are, therefore, determined to\nlink all the villages of India not only with good roads, but also with good\ntelecom and Internet services. A lot of progress has taken place in this\nregard in the past two years. We shall further accelerate this work.\n\nSmall and cottage industries are a big source of employment. The Khadi\nand Village Industries Commission (KVIC) alone provides employment to\nmore than sixty lakh people under its various units. It has added six lakh\nnew employment opportunities during the past three years. We shall take\nmany new measures to strengthen the KVIC. We have also launched\neffective steps to popularize khadi and village industry products in foreign\nmarkets.\nTourism is a big source of employment generation and foreign exchange\nearning. Indeed, it is the fastest growing industry in the world today.\nTo achieve this end, we shall unveil a progressive National Tourism Policy\nbefore the end of this year.\n\nFriends, our entire society, and especially poor people are fed up with the\nlong delays and other deficiencies in our judicial system. The Government\nhas set up over 1,700 Fast-Track Courts to reduce the mountain of long\npending cases.\nWe shall soon take necessary steps to repeal or amend all laws and rules,\nwhich hurt the interests of the poor. We shall also review all those\nprocedures and practices, which unfortunately have tended to make the\npoor targets of harassment by agencies of the Government\n\nThe Government is committed to the goal of ~Health For All~. After the\nunprecedented success of the polio vaccination campaign, the Government\nhas decided to soon start similar mass campaigns against leprosy,\ntuberculosis, malaria, HIV/AIDS, and other such diseases.\nIn recent years, there has been a great interest, both in India and abroad,\nin Ayurveda and other Indian systems of medicine. We are considering\nmaking available a low-cost kit containing certain traditional medicines and\nherbal products, which have proved their efficacy over centuries in treating\nmany common ailments. I urge our kisans and pharmaceutical companies\nto seize this new opportunity created by the growing worldwide attraction\nfor Ayurvedic products and Indian systems of medicine.\n\nWe are observing this year as Women’s Empowerment Year. Therefore,\nwe shall impart greater momentum to the implementation of all the\nprogrammes aimed at the welfare of our mothers, sisters, and girls. I\nespecially wish to congratulate the Self Help Groups started by women,\nwhich have begun a silent socio-economic revolution. There are many\nsuccess stories in India, and also in the South Asian region, where Self\nHelp Groups using micro-credit from banks have made a significant dent in\nrural and urban poverty.\nTherefore, the Government has decided to facilitate the setting up of at\nleast one self-help group in each of the 14 lakh habitations in the country,\nby the end of 2004.\n\nWe have taken yet another major decision for women’s economic\nempowerment. Over the next three years, all public-sector banks will lend\nfive percent of the net bank credit to women entrepreneurs. This will make\nRs. 17,000 crore of bank credit available for women-sponsored businesses.\n\nWhile launching these new initiatives, we are acutely aware of one fact.\nUsually, the Government prepares schemes and programmes but finds that\nthe system is inadequate to the task of implementing them in an effective\nand time-bound manner.\n\nThe Government has, therefore, decided to observe the coming year as the\nYear of Implementation.\n\nTowards this end, we shall constitute a Rapid Action Force to monitor the\nimplementation of various poverty-alleviation and employment generation\nprogrammes.\n\nChildren are the most precious wealth of our nation. Ten years ago,\nrepresenting India in the World Conference for Children, I had argued for\ngreater investments for all-round development of children. However, the\nagencies of the Government alone cannot achieve this. I earnestly appeal\nto all voluntary organizations, businesses, and common citizens to ensure\nthat we together enable every child in India to develop to their fullest\npotential.\n\nNext month, there is a special session of the United Nations General\nAssembly on children. India will reiterate her commitment to children’s\nwelfare at this important forum.\nFriends,\n\nThere is political stability in the country. There is a thriving democracy. In a\nbig country like ours, there are bound to be small and not-so-small\nproblems. Political opposition is natural in a democracy, but there should\nbe no opposition for the sake of opposition.\n\nThere is full freedom in our country for political parties, intellectuals, and\nthe media to express their views. This is, indeed, a matter of pride for us. It\nis only such freedom that nurtures and strengthens the roots of democracy.\n\nHowever, freedom comes with responsibility. Our democracy demands of\nall of us that we discharge our responsibilities conscientiously, and that we\nrespect proper norms.\n\nBrothers and sisters,\n\nWe are all citizens of an India that is on her way to attaining greatness. We\nshould have confidence in India’s future. We should have faith in ourselves.\nWe should have trust in our own hands and in our own brains. Trust is a\nresource. It has been my endeavour and the endeavour of my Government\nthat we nurture mutual trust. Trust should not be broken. Nobody should\ncome in the way of building mutual trust.\n\nIt is only on the strength of mutual trust, cooperation, and coexistence that\nwe can create a future of hope for India.\n\nCome, let us together resolve today to build a united, strong, prosperous\nand a caring India.\n\nJai Hind!\n\nJai Hind!\nJai Hind!"},{"year":2000,"pm":"A.B.

Wherever you may be, at the highest mountain peaks of the\nHimalayas or on the shores of the Indian Ocean; on the desert sands of\nRajasthan or in the green jungles of the North East, may my greetings\nreach all of you.\n\n Today is also the festival of Raksha Bandhan. The power of\nfriendship can transform even a simple hand-spun thread into an\nunbreakable relationship. On this auspicious occasion, I extend my good\nwishes to all of you, especially to all my sisters.\n\n This is the first Independence Day of the new century. While looking\nback at the century just past, we must work hard to convert the challenges\nof the new century into opportunities.\n\n We must make our Independence last forever. We must reiterate,\ntoday, our resolve to defend our nation.\n\n Today is a day of sacred remembrance. It is a moment for\nintrospection. We offer our heartfelt gratitude to all the known and unknown\nmartyrs. The memory of their martyrdom will forever live on in our hearts.\nTheir sacrifices will always inspire us.\n\n Today, we especially remember Mahatma Gandhiji. He was not only\nthe foremost leader of our Freedom Struggle, but he was also among the\ngreatest personalities of the 20th century.\n\n On today’s auspicious day, we extend our greetings to the people of\nall the countries in the world. We wish that the 21st century would bring the\nmessage of peace, fraternity, cooperation, and steady progress for the\nentire world.\n\n Today, we send our best wishes to millions of Non-Resident Indians\nand Persons of Indian Origin living in other countries. Wherever they may\nlive, they are always emotionally attached to India. We wish all of them\nsuccess and prosperity.\n\n Today, I extend my felicitations to the people of the three new States\nthat have found their place on the map of India after the reorganisation of\nMadhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, and Bihar. We are confident that the new\nStates of Chhattisgarh, Uttaranchal, and Jharkhand will soon earn their\nrightful place in the Union of India.\n\n We have succeeded in our commitment of creating these three new\nStates. After the formation of these states, we have to work together for\ntheir development so that they become shining examples of success.\n\n The new century is a Century of the Youth. India, too, which has lived\nfor thousands of years, has now become a young nation. Nearly seventy\npercent of our population is less than the age of 35. These young men and\nwomen are more ambitious, more aware, and more active than their\npredecessors. They not only think big, but they also work hard to realise\ntheir dreams.\n\n I have full faith in India’s youth. It is our responsibility to fully support\nour young men and women in building a bright future for themselves and\ntheir Motherland.\n\n Dear Countrymen, last year when I had addressed you from the\nramparts of this very Red Fort, our country was going through an\nextraordinary situation. The Lok Sabha had been dissolved and fresh\nelections announced. It was in these circumstances, that we had to face\nthe aggression in Kargil. And India emerged victorious in this war.\n\n One year later, democracy has become stronger in the country.\nIndia’s international standing has risen. Our voice is being heard attentively\nin the capitals of the world.\n\n India is on the move. An India full of self-confidence is marching\nforward on the path to progress.\n\n It is an India that is as determined to win against all adversities as\nwere our brave jawans and airmen who drove back the enemy’s forces.\n\n Our hearts are filled with ever-lasting gratitude towards the brave\nsoldiers of the Kargil and all previous wars.\n\n Pakistan would be committing a terrible folly if it thinks that it can\nsecure anything through the undeclared war that it has been waging\nagainst India. Kashmir has been an unbreakable part of India, and it will\nremain so.\n\n Our neighbour must realise that the clock cannot be turned back. I\nwould advise the rulers and also the people of Pakistan to pay heed to the\nfollowing verse from the lyricist, Sahir Ludhianvi:\n\nGone is that time, gone is that age,\n\nWhen ~Two Nations~ was the slogan;\n\nGone are those people,\n\nWhose purpose was Partition!\n\nOne, now, are all Indians,\n\nOne, now, are all Indians,\n\nOh India. know this!\nOh World, know this!\n\nOh World, know this!\n\n The 21st century does not permit the redrawing of borders either in\nthe name of religion or on the strength of the sword. This is the age for\nresolving differences, not for prolonging disputes.\n\n The people of Jammu, Kashmir, and Ladakh are tired of violence and\nbloodshed. They are craving for peace. We need to apply the salve of\nbrotherhood on the wounded body of Jammu and Kashmir.\n\n That is why, I recently said that India is prepared to apply the balm for\nKashmir’s agony within the framework of Insaniyat (humanity).\n\n The world knows who has derailed the move to end hostilities and to\nstart the peace process. The world knows who has torpedoed these efforts.\n\n On the one hand, Pakistan says it is willing to participate in talks. On\nthe other hand, it continues to be deeply involved in violence, killings, and\ncross-border terrorism. Activities of the terrorists and proposals for peace\ntalks cannot go together.\n\n India’s willingness and ability to deal firmly with violence, terrorism,\nextremism, and separatism should not be underestimated.\n\n Dear Countrymen, we have to build a magnificent nation. There is no\nother country in the world, which is so ancient, so big, so populous, and so\nrich in diversities; that has preserved its democracy, its unity, and its\nculture; and that is fast emerging as a modern and prosperous nation.\n\n We have achieved success, too, in this endeavor. Every section of\nour society has contributed to this success.\n\n In the present times, India is called upon to pursue two major\nimperatives. These are: Security and Development. They are\ncomplementary to each other. Without security, there can be no\ndevelopment; without development, our security is incomplete.\n\n Now we have to make determined efforts to meet the economic\nchallenges before the nation. We have to accelerate and broaden our\ndevelopment process, so that no child of Mother India remains hungry,\nhomeless, unemployed, or is without access to medical care.\n\n We have to reduce regional and social disparities.\n\n We have to make our brethren belonging to Scheduled Castes,\nScheduled Tribes, Other Backward Classes, and minorities equal partners\nin our developmental process.\n\n Therefore, let us together resolve to make this decade, the Decade of\nDevelopment.\n\n To realise this goal, we have decided to achieve the target of\ndoubling India’s per capita income in the next ten years.\n\n Dear Countrymen, to achieve this ambitious target, we have to\nundertake many important reforms in our economy. At the same time, we\nneed to implement necessary reforms in our administration, our judiciary, in\neducation, and in other areas.\n\n Reforms are the need of the hour. For example, the world has\nchanged much in the last fifty years; and so has India. There have been\nmany far-reaching political and economic transformations throughout the\nglobe.\n To reform is to turn the inevitability of change in the direction of\nprogress.\n\n To reform is to improve the life of every citizen.\n\n Take for example, the reforms in the power sector that the Centre\nand various State Governments are presently carrying out. These will\nreduce the losses of our electricity boards, stop the theft of power, and\nensure adequate availability of power for increasing production and\nemployment.\n\n Similarly, the reforms that we are implementing in the telecom sector\nwill enable us to provide cheaper telephones, mobile phones, and Internet\nservices in all parts of the country.\n\n There is no scope for either apprehension or fear about our economic\nreforms. I remember that some people had expressed similar fears even\nduring the Green Revolution. These fears later proved to be baseless.\n\n The perspective of our economic reforms is based on our own\nconcept. You know that almost all political parties have, at different times,\nand in different ways at the Centre and in different States, been adopting\nthe economic reforms programme.\n\n I urge our farmers, workers, other producers, industrialists, and our\nintelligentsia to contribute to building a consensus in favour of the\neconomic reforms.\n\n In this connection, I would like to express my special appreciation to\nall the central trade unions. I met their leaders three days ago, and we had\na very constructive dialogue. They have withdrawn their proposed\nnation-wide strike. The interests of our workers will be fully taken into\naccount in the economic reform process.\n\n This year, the Government is going to take many big and important\nsteps to accelerate our economic and social development and bring its\nbenefits to the largest number of people.\n\n I wish to congratulate our farmers for ensuring that we have not faced\na scarcity of foodgrains despite a rapidly rising population. Today, there is\nno shortage of food; rather there is a shortage of facilities to store our food\nstocks.\n\n We have formulated a National Agriculture Policy for the first time\nsince Independence. This Policy aims to increase agricultural production by\nfour percent every year. Concrete steps would be taken to check the\ndeclining investments in the agricultural sector and to facilitate increase in\nthese investments.\n\n For the first time since Independence, the Central Government has\ndevised a well-conceived and time-bound programme for rural roads. This\nhundred per cent Centrally sponsored scheme, which is called the ~Prime\nMinister’s Rural Roads Scheme~, aims to connect, within the next three\nyears, every village that has a population of more than one thousand,\nthrough good all-weather roads. In the next seven years, every village with\na population of more than five hundred will be similarly connected. For this\nproject, the Central Government is making a provision of Rs. 5,000 crore in\nits first year. It will be launched on Gandhi Jayanti this year.\n\n The National Highway Development Project is an ambitious one. A\nfour-lane Golden Quadrilateral connecting Delhi, Mumbai, Calcutta, and\nChennai will be ready by 2003. The North-South and East-West corridors\nwill be ready by 2007.\n\n Khadi, village industries, and small-scale industries are the backbone\nof India’s economy. We would like the benefits of economic reforms to\nreach them too. There will be a national convention of small-scale and\ncottage industries on the 30th of this month, where we shall announce\nmany important decisions.\n\n In a very short time, India has become a strong power in Information\nTechnology. In software exports alone, India is expected to have exports of\nmore than Rs.2,00,000 crore by 2008. Through this, lakhs of educated\npersons are likely to get attractive employment opportunities, both in India\nand abroad.\n\n To reach the benefits of Information Technology to the common\npeople, our Government has taken many important decisions in the last two\nyears, and will take many more in future.\n\n I want to see every school and every village to have access to\ncomputers and the Internet in as less time as possible.\n\n We are committed to ensuring that every village and hamlet gets\naccess to clean drinking water in the next four years. This year, the\nallocation for the scheme has been increased by Rs. 2,000 crore and its\nimplementation will be intensified.\n\n Before the end of this year, the Government will announce an\nIntegrated National Health Policy, the aim of which will be to quickly\nachieve ~Health For All~. The policy will also ensure that every citizen is\nprovided with primary health care. Ayurveda, Yoga, Unani, Siddha, and\nHomeopathy will be given their rightful place.\n\n Recently, the rapidly spreading disease of HIV/AIDS has become a\ngrave challenge to our nation. I appeal to all sections of society to fully\nparticipate in building awareness about this epidemic. They should also\nmake necessary changes in their behaviour so that this disease can be\ncontrolled.\n\n The most valuable investment that we can make in India’s future is to\nensure that every child gets education. We have decided that by 2010,\nevery Indian child will get education up to class eight. We have launched\nSarva Shiksha Abhiyan (Education for All campaign) to achieve this goal.\nEducation until graduation has been made free for women. All poor families\nshould take advantage of this.\n\n Science and technology have become the main engine of economic\ngrowth. We should ensure that every vehicle of economic development is\nequipped with this engine. Towards this end, the Government is taking\nconcrete steps to remove the gap between academia and industry.\n\n Dear Countrymen, a bright future is knocking at India’s door. We can,\nhowever, realise this future to the extent that we are able to further\nstrengthen our national unity, secularism, social goodwill, and our\ndemocratic system.\n\n India is a land of diversities. We have, in ample measure,\ngeographical diversities; linguistic diversities; religious diversities; and\ndiversities in customs and traditions. Despite these diversities, or perhaps\nbecause of them, India has always remained united.\n\n We are one in many, and many in one. The whole world is amazed at\nhow India has successfully sustained this magic not just today, but for\nmany millennia.\n\n This may be magic for the rest of the world; but for Indians, it is life\nitself.\n\n Religious intolerance and hate have never been part of India’s liberal\nculture. I appeal to the people of all faiths and castes not to create\nimaginary enemies, and not to resort to the path of using the sword that\ninflicts wounds on oneself.\n\n Recently, a few unfortunate incidents have spoiled communal peace\nand goodwill, in some places. The Government will not tolerate the\nactivities of any organisation that spreads communal discord or incites\nviolence.\n\n As Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar said, our independence is incomplete\nwithout social justice. In the new century, India needs more social justice.\nHowever, that kind of social justice (Samajik Nyay) is needed which also\npromotes social harmony (Samajik Samarasata).\n\n The policy of reservations is one of the important guarantors of social\njustice for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and Other Backward\nClasses. The problem of backlog in reservations was persisting for some\ntime. Recently, we amended the Constitution and solved this problem.\n\n Women are the backbone of our social system and culture. Our\ndreams of India’s future can only be realised if our women are educated,\nare made economically prosperous, are empowered politically, and are\nenabled to play a bigger role in society.\n\n We have promised to provide reservations to women in the\nParliament and the State Legislatures. There is now a need to quickly bring\nabout a consensus to implement this revolutionary idea. I have had several\nopportunities to meet many women who have become members and\nchairpersons of panchayats and municipalities by winning from reserved\nseats. They have, through their performance, proved that they are not\nsecond to men, either in the democratic process or in administration.\n\n The North-Eastern States have a special place in the nation’s life and\nin India’s development. The implementation of developmental projects and\nprogrammes has been suffering from many hurdles. Now, a special cell has\nbeen created in the Prime Minister’s Office to remove these hurdles and\nspeed up the developmental process. This cell will closely monitor the\ndevelopmental works in the region. There has been an improvement in the\nsituation, thanks to the cooperation of the people and State Governments\nof this region.\n\n It is sad that the biggest impediment to faster development in the\nNorth-East has been the extremist organisations that are fomenting\nviolence and trouble in the region. I appeal to the leaders and followers of\nthese organisations to give up this dangerous and futile path. The\nGovernment is presently engaged in talks with some organisations in the\nregion so that peace and development can be restored in the North-East. I\nam confident that these efforts will bear fruit.\n\n India is a Union of States. Our States have an important role to play\nin ensuring that the fruits of development reach every Indian home. We are\ncommitted to decentralisation of power. We have decided to give our\nStates more financial and administrative powers. We would like our\nPanchayati Raj institutions to also benefit from decentralization of power,\nso that their functioning becomes more efficient and effective. We have\ntaken concrete steps in this direction.\n\n In the last two-and-a-half years, we have made continuous efforts to\nincrease dialogue and coordination between the Centre and the State\nGovernments. All States have contributed to this process. This has\nimproved cooperation and concord between the Centre and the States.\nConsequently, there has been an increasing convergence in our viewpoints\nand goals. For this, I thank all the State Governments and their Chief\nMinisters.\n\n We shall intensify our campaign against corruption in high places.\nOur country cannot make expected progress in development without\nprobity in administration and in public life.\n\n One of the big failings in our national life has been that people expect\nthe Government to solve even those problems, which they could easily\nresolve through their collective efforts. The Government, after all, has\nlimited resources. In addition, experience has shown us that, those\nprogrammes which are implemented without people’s participation, rarely\nyield the expected results.\n\n Let me illustrate. Be it population stabilisation or dealing with natural\ncalamities, conserving water and electricity, or keeping our public places\nclean and beautiful, all these initiatives can succeed only when our citizens\nparticipate enthusiastically and in an organised manner.\n\n Dear Countrymen, on the first Independence Day of the 21st century,\nlet us draw inspiration from all the good and glorious aspects of our past.\nHowever, let us not become obsessed with the past.\n\n I have been emphasising repeatedly that India should turn its\nattention to the challenges and opportunities of the future. We should not\nbe stuck in the contentious issues of the past.\n\n Come, let us look to the future. We have to create a prosperous,\nself-reliant, and self-confident India. Indeed, we have already embarked\nalong this path. We will march further in this direction. We are being\ncounted among the ranks of successful nations.\n\n We must not stop. Rather, we must step up the speed of our journey.\n\n I call upon our farmers, workers, artisans, employees, youth, and,\nindeed, all our citizens, to make their contribution to a happy and\nprosperous India.\n I ask our entrepreneurs to hoist the flag of their capabilities and\nprowess and demonstrate to the rest of the world that Indian industrialists\nare second to none in any competition.\n\n I appeal to the Non-Resident Indians to contribute their fullest to this\nmomentous task.\n\n I exhort our scientists and engineers that they scale new heights of\nknowledge and science to earn a bright name for themselves and their\ncountry.\n\n I appeal to India’s sportspersons that they take our tricolor to\ntriumphant positions in the arena of international sports.\n\n The entire nation sends its best wishes to our sports contingent that\nis taking part in next month’s Olympic Games at Sydney.\n\n Come, let all of us contribute our mite to the creation of a Parishrami\nBharat (industrious India), Parakrami Bharat (achieving India), and a Vijayi\nBharat (winning India).\n\n Our motto for all ages has been:\n\nLet us walk together\n\nLet us speak in one voice\n\nLet our hearts beat together\n\n In other words, let us march forward united, all of us together, and\ntaking everybody together.\n\n Let us make the 21st Century, India’s Century.\n This is our resolve. This is our aspiration.\n\n Thank you.\n\n Jai Hind!"},{"year":1999,"pm":"A.B.

This is\na day of hallowed remembrance for us. This is a day of dedication for us.\n\nThis year's Independence Day has special significance for all of us. The\npresent century is coming to an end. The world will have entered the next\ncentury by the time of the next Independence Day.\n\nAs we stand at the sunset of the 20th century, and look back at the events\nof the era that has passed, we see the end of colonialism from Indian soil to\nbe the most important development. Our great leaders, and many\ngenerations of our countrymen, waged a powerful struggle for\nindependence. By doing so, they paved the way for the independence of\nother countries, too.\n\nWe pay our homage to those self-sacrificing and devoted leaders and\npatriots who struggled for freedom throughout their lives, and, when\nnecessary, even laid down their lives as aahuti (offering) in the great yagya\nof freedom.\n\nCome, all my countrymen, let us strive to become worthy heirs to those\ngreat leaders. We dedicate today's sacred day to their memory.\n\nIn the same way, I offer my condolences to the valiant jawans, officers and\nothers belonging to the Army and the Air Force, who displayed magnificent\nheroism and the spirit of sacrifice in recapturing that part of our Motherland\nin Kargil from the enemy. All of us bow our heads in gratitude for those who\nwere martyred in the Kargil war.\n\nAlmost all our countrymen have seen on television glimpses of the\nimpossible summits, which our heroes overcame and pushed out the\nenemy. To gain victory at such heights is not only to surmount the\nsky-piercing peaks, it displays the full might of the nation. It is a symbol of\nthe bravery of our Armed Forces.\n\nHow can we forget such heroes?\n\nHow can we forget those wounded soldiers whose only wish was: how can\nwe get well and rejoin our battalion to repulse the enemy?\n\nHow can we forget the members of the families of those brave martyrs,\nwho, on receiving the body of their beloved, said, ~We do not have tears in\nour eyes, we have pride in our heart~?\n\nHow can we forget the mother whose lament was that she had had only\none son, and therefore, could not send another to fight for our country?\n\nI know that mere words of solace are not enough. We have to take\nconcrete measures for the families of the martyrs and wounded soldiers so\nthat they may live a life of comfort and dignity.\n\nIt has been said that we remember and honour soldiers during a war, and\nin the immediate aftermath. But as the days pass, we forget them. And it is\na sad fact that many who sacrificed their life and limb in previous wars were\noften forgotten. I give you my personal pledge that this will not happen\nagain.\n\nThe Red Fort and its world-renowned ramparts are not merely a\ngeographical spot. The very heartbeat of India's freedom struggle is linked\nto this fort and its ramparts. In the First War of Independence of 1857, this\nis where Bahadur Shah Zafar was held a prisoner.\n\nNetaji Subhash Chandra Bose made this very fort the target of his\ncampaign in 1943 and, blowing the bugle of Independence, gave the\nstirring call to his countrymen: ~Dilli Chalo, Chalo Lal Kile~\nIt is from this very fort that our first Prime Minister, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru\nhoisted for the first time, the tricolour of Free India in 1947.\n\nMore than half a century has passed. Today, we stand at the threshold of a\nnew era.\n\nCome, let us enter this new era united in step and united in resolve.\n\nWhen I addressed you from this rampart last year, there was uncertainty\nand cynicism in the atmosphere. I was being asked:\n\nWill we be able to withstand economic sanctions?\n\nTo what extent will we be able to ward off the economic crisis, which had\nstruck the Tiger Economies of Southeast Asia?\n\nWill the Government be allowed to carry on its work?\n\nToday, speaking to a self-confident India, I declare:\n\nSanctions have lost their effect. They have become a thing of the past. We\nhave dealt with them in such a way that they hardly had any effect on our\neconomy.\n\nWe kept the South-east Asian economic crisis at bay;\n\nYes, the Government was brought down, but the country was not. It\ncontinued to march ahead, fulfilling the mantra of Charaiveti, Charaiveti\n(Move on, Move on). The Government continued to discharge its duty.\n\nMost important, a war was imposed on us.\n\nWe have not just triumphed over difficulties, we have achieved much. In\nspite of obstacles that were put in our way,\n\nOur National Income has grown by 6 percent;\n\nHaving crossed 200 million tonnes, production of foodgrains is higher today\nthan ever before;\n\nFood stocks are higher today than ever. For this our kisans deserve our\nfelicitations. Our agricultural scientists are also worthy of our praise.\n\nIndustrial production is reviving at an energetic pace;\n\nThe new initiatives which have been taken in infrastructure have infused a\nnew purposefulness right across the economy;\n\nAt over 30 billion dollars our foreign exchange reserves are higher than\never before;\n\nThe Sensex in the stock market has risen to record levels. In spite of Kargil,\nour companies have been able to increase their market value by over Rs.\n200,000 crore.\n\nThe off-take of cement for building houses is 22 percent higher than it has\never been; Facilities which were known only to the rich, to the few, and in\nour cities alone - insurance for their output, credit cards - are now available\nto, and are being taken advantage of by farmers and by others in our\nfar-flung villages.\n\nAnd we are stronger than ever. Pokharan has given us enviable strength\nand self-confidence AGNI-2 has been tested - in the face of pressure - and\nwill be integrated into our defence arsenal.\n\nPSLV and INSAT 2- E have been launched. What a feat our scientists have\naccomplished: sending not just one, but three satellites on a single rocket\nfar out into space, and placing each of them at the precise point in space,\nwhich had been fixed. This has been a magnificent achievement.\n\nYes, one thing has certainly come down. It is the rate of inflation. At 1.3\npercent, this is the lowest rate in seventeen years.\n\nThere has also been a sea change in the way the world sees us. Last year\nwe had taken a major step - Pokhran 2- which was essential for our\nsecurity, a step which had been contemplated for long but which could not\nbe taken because of the pressures which were put on successive\ngovernments.\n\nSome did not agree with our assessment. Some even sought to portray us\nas an irresponsible nation. However today, within a year, in the councils of\nthe world, ~India~ is synonymous with ~responsibility~\n\nThe world has seen that we will protect our national interest at all costs:\nwhether it is in developing an atomic weapons capability, whether it is in\ndeveloping missile - capability, whether it is in driving adversaries out of our\nland:\n\nThe world has seen that we will withstand all pressures that we will\nwithstand all pressures that are intended to keep us from taking the\nmeasures that we consider necessary in our national interest;\n\nAlso the world has seen that whatever we do, will be for self-defence, never\nfor aggression.\n\nBut the world has also seen that we are capable of doing so with utmost\nrestraint, with utmost responsibility. These were the principles, which\nguided us when Pakistan forced the Kargil war on us. Our response was\nwell thought out. It was so effective that it left the enemy stunned.\nThe world today has well realized that we would do whatever is required to\nprotect our country.\n\nThe world has also understood that we would act with utmost responsibility\nand restraint even when so gravely provoked. This has raised the\nreputation of India in the international community.\n\nThe Lahore bus journey was taken to improve our relations with Pakistan.\nThis made the world realize that we truly want peace and friendship. This\njourney was not a showpiece. It was a serious and well-considered move,\nwhich we made knowing fully well that there could be risks in it.\n\nOur honesty made an impact on the international community. Later, when\nthe bus to Lahore was taken to Kargil, it did not take much time for the\nworld to realise that Pakistan not only violated the Shimla Agreement and\nthe Lahore Declaration, but it also crossed the borders of trust and\ngoodwill.\n\nThat is what turned the world's opinion. Pakistan stood completely isolated\non the world stage. India received widespread support in the world for the\nfirst time.\n\nI do hope that the people of Pakistan too will reflect on these events. We\nreached out to you with a message of friendship. What did we gain in\nreturn? Hundreds lost their lives. Relation severe spoilt. The resources\nwhich ought to have been used for economic and social development were\ninstead spent on war.\n\nWe need peace in order to raise the standard of living of the people in both\ncountries. For peace, we need trust. Has trust increased on account of all\nthat happened in Kargil. Does the path of armed intrusion lead to\nfriendship?\nTerrorists are being trained in Pakistan. Camps are being run for them.\nHordes of terrorists are being sent into India. They are killing innocent\npeople. They are targeting women and children. How can meaningful\ndialogue take place in this atmosphere?\n\nPakistan must realize that no problem can be resolved if it continues to\npromote terrorist activities. We shall not let the evil designs of terrorists\nsucceed. Today, Punjab is free of terrorism. The people of Jammu and\nKashmir are fed up with terrorism. Even Assam and the North-East are\naffected.\n\nAll of us want peace. People are worried about the future of their children.\n\nTerrorism is a curse on the world. When it is combined with religious\nextremism, it becomes a graver danger to humanity. All of you are familiar\nwith the saying ~Karela Aur Neem Chadha~ (The bitterness of Karela is\nfurther worsened by adding to it the bitterness of Neem.)\n\nIn our case, over thirty five thousand of our people have been killed by\nterrorists. Terrorism has become a big problem in many other parts of the\nworld, too. It is obstructing the path of peace and development. Today,\nthere is a need to mobilise world opinion against terrorism.\n\nToday, on the occasion of Independence Day, India stands with full\nself-confidence. Our gaze is turned to the future. Our standing in the world\nhas risen. Now, the people are not attracted by the controversies and\nnarrow disputes of yesterday.\n\nThroughout the war in Kargil, I was specially satisfied by two features.\n\nThere was no communal tension anywhere in the country. Goodwill and\nbrotherhood prevailed everywhere, including in Jammu & Kashmir. This\nmust have despaired those who thought that riots would break out in India\nas soon as the spark of war is lit. Those who hatched the conspiracy of\nstrife, must have been truly disillusioned. The people of all sections of\nsociety worked for India's success in the war. A powerful wave of patriotism\ntraveled everywhere.\n\nWhen I went to Kargil and met our jawans, I saw our entire country there:\nsoldiers from Nagaland, from Assam, from Tamil Nadu, from almost every\nstate were fighting for the country. There was not the slightest distance\nbetween them on account of caste or religion or region.\n\nThis is the real India. We must make, their oneness our own. We have to\nlive for this India. We have to work for this India. And, if necessary, we\nhave to lay down our lives for this India, as our brave jawans did.\n\nKargil has once again shown that whenever our patriotism is aroused, all of\nus stand as one with full confidence and determination, as a fist clenched in\nconviction. We face our challenges unitedly. Our adversaries should\nbeware of this.\n\nAt the same time, there is an equally important lesson for us. Now that the\ncrisis has been beaten back, do not unclench this fist of unity.\n\nThe battle is not over. New challenges are knocking at our doors. The\npatriotism that coursed through the veins of Indians should be made a\npermanent feature of our lives.\n\nAll of us remember the talisman Gandhiji gave us: when in doubt about\nwhat to do, he taught us, think of the least, of the most helpless man you\nhave seen, ask yourself, ~Will this step be in his interest?~ he said, and\nyou will see all your doubts melt away.\n\nKargil gives us a second talisman: As we contemplate a step, let us ask\nourselves: ~Is it worthy of the soldier who gave his life on those mountains?\nDoes the impulse which lies behind it measure up to the spirit which filled\nthat soldier as he fought to protect our Motherland?~\n\nThe challenges that confront us cannot be overcome only by the men on\nthe frontiers doing their duty. There is a need for an organized and\ndisciplined nation to stand behind them. We must defend our country and\ndevelop our society by keeping national interests utmost in our minds. If our\neconomy is not strong, and if we are not self-reliant in important matters of\nnational security, then we cannot successfully face external challenges.\n\nAll of us, wherever we may be, whatever work we may be doing, we should\ndischarge our responsibilities well. We must never allow any limb of our\nnation or society to become weak.\n\nIt is clear from the effective way in which we have overcome our challenges\nand dealt with our difficulties, that we can do anything if we resolve to do it.\nWhat is needed is to take a pledge: that whatever we can do, we will now\ndo.\n\nI have a vision of India: an India free of hunger and fear, an India free of\nilliteracy and want.\n\nI dream of an India that is prosperous, strong and caring. An India, that\nregains a place of honour in the comity of great nations.\n\nCome, let us build an India in which we have balanced development that\nbenefits all regions and all sections of society. I note with regret that\nseveral regions in the country - including the North-Eastern States - have\nbeen the victims of unbalanced progress. The nation has an especially\npressing obligation to bring the people of the North-East into the\ndevelopmental mainstream.\nCome, let us build an India in which Dalits, Adivasis, and Backward\nClasses are not only freed from economic deprivation, but also enjoy the\nfruits of social justice. The path that will take us to this ideal is the path of\nsamata, mamata, and samajik samarasta.\n\nCome, let us build an India in which our nari shakti - our women - are able\nto realize its full potential - from shaping the future of their families to\nshaping the future of the nation. It is our collective responsibility to\nempower them economically, socially, educationally and also politically. In\nthis regard, I would like to see early passage of the legislation to reserve\nseats for women in Parliament and State Assemblies. We have already\nseen how women have given an excellent account of themselves wherever\nthey have got an opportunity to serve in panchayats and other local bodies.\n\nCome, let us build an India in which the minorities fully enjoy the fruits of\nnational development, while having full opportunities to contribute to it. Our\ncountry belongs to all. And all are entitled to equal and fair treatment in the\neyes of the law and the Government. India, which is home to the great\nsecular principle of Sarva Panth Samabhav, fully guarantees the religious\nfreedom of all communities. It is a matter of immense pride for India that all\nthe religions of the world have a harmonious co-existence here. Unity in\nDiversity is our priceless heritage.\n\nIt is also a matter of much satisfaction that the past year has seen a record\nlow in communal violence.\n\nIndia is the largest democracy in the world. The tradition of democracy in\nour country is very old. When this Century opened, democracy was the\npreserve of just a handful of countries, and even in them it was limited to\nsmall sections of the people. Today there are just a handful who are still out\nof the pale of democracy. There is scarcely a country whose people do not\naspire to it.\nCome, let us strengthen Indian democracy. Let us make it an ideal for other\ncountries of the world. Let us transform our political democracy into\neconomic and social democracy.\n\nCome, let us make India a nation of high achievers - in every sphere. In\nbusiness and economy, in education, in science and technology, in arts\nand culture, and also in sports. Let us make India synonymous with\n~achievement~, achievement of the kind that can be benchmarked\nglobally. All of us are heartened by what our young men and women have\nachieved in recent times. The success stories of young Indians working\nabroad are making headlines almost every day. If young Indians can script\nsuch shining successes abroad, why shouldn't we create conditions for\nthem to do so right here?\n\nCome let us together build a Parishrami Bharat, a Parakrami Bharat, a\nVijayi Bharat.\n\nTo realise this vision, let us step out of the swamp of negativity.\n\nLet us not be obsessed with the past. Face the future.\n\nMarch with confidence towards the goal.\n\nTurn from problems - to solutions.\n\nToday, when the 20th century is coming to an end, and the 21st century is\nknocking at our doorsteps, let us draw inspiration from our glorious past\nand resolve to build an even more glorious future.\n\nCome, let us make good use of the natural and human resources of our\nMotherland, Bharat and make the 21st century, India's century.\n\nWe are inheritors of an ageless culture and a proud civilisation. Greatness\nis our past - and also our future.\n\nCome, let all of us together raise our voice in saying:\n\nJai Hind,\n\nJai Hind,\n\nJai Hind."},{"year":1998,"pm":"A.B. Vajpayee","party":"BJP","title":"Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan, Jai Vigyan: Harbinger of Progress","footnote":"Printed from the website http://www.archivepmo.nic.in","source":"PMO Archive","url":"http://archivepmo.nic.in/abv/content_print.php?nodeid=9238&nodetype=2","text":"My dear Sisters, Brothers and Children,\n\nI greet all of you on the occasion of the 51st Anniversary of our country’s\nIndependence. Half a century has passed still it appears as if it happened\nyesterday. Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru had unfurled our beloved tricolour in\nthe blue sky from this very spot for the first time. Since then it has been a\ntradition to unfurl the National flag from the historic Red Fort. I had never\nimagined that I shall have this good fortune one day. It is a symbol of\nstrength and potential of the Indian democracy that the son of a school\nteacher hailing from the dusty and smoky environs of a village has the\nprivilege of unfurling the national tricolour from the ramparts of Red Fort on\nthis auspicious Independence Day.\n\nWe all know that independence did not come to us easily. On the hand,\nwhile tens of thousands of our countrymen and women suffered in jails\nduring the non-violent freedom struggle under the leadership of Mahatma\nGandhi, on the other hand, thousands of revolutionaries sacrificed their\nlives on the gallows. We owe our independence to these known and\nunknown martyrs and freedom fighter. Let all of us together pay homage to\nthem and take a pledge that we shall defend our freedom, even if we have\nto sacrifice everything for this.\n\nOur country has been subjected to foreign aggression. In this short period\nof 50 years, we had to face four aggressions. But we have safeguarded our\nindependence and integrity. The highest credit for this undoubtedly goes to\nour soldiers. Away from their homes and dear ones, braving dangers all the\ntime, they guard our frontiers day and night. This is why we are always\nreassured about our security. Be it the snowy expanse of Siachen with\nminus 32 degree Celsius temperature or the thick forests of the North-East,\nthe deserts of Kutch or Jaisalmer or the deep waters of the Indian Ocean,\nour troops are vigilant everywhere. On our behalf I greet all these troops of\nthe Army, the Air Force and the Navy and other security personnel. While\ncongratulating them we must say ~O! Brave Soldiers, we are proud of\nyou!~\n\nThe Forces need our support. Our farmers and labour force have\nstrengthened the second line of defence in the farms, the barns and the\nfactories. We can never forget this. Lal Bahadur Shastri had said: Jai\nJawan, Jai Kisan. One is incomplete without the other, unfulfilled without\nthe other. I have added a new aspect to this: Jai Vigyan!\n\nPokhran Test\n\nWe can neither develop nor defend the country in the 21st century with the\nresources of the past century. We have to modernise our forces to enable\nthem to face danger and safeguard our independence and integrity. With\nonly this aim, we conducted the nuclear tests on the 11th and 13th of May\nthis year. The tests of Pokhran were not the efforts of just one night. They\nwere the results of years of hard work on the part of our scientists,\nengineers, technicians and the defence forces. I have only tried to further\nthe work the foundation of which was credit by Smt. Indira Gandhi. I was\nonly a means. The credit for this great achievement goes to our talented\nscientists and the hard work of our defence forces. I wish to heartily\ncongratulate all of them on this auspicious occasion of this Independence\nDay.\n\nI am even grateful to all of you for extending your full support in this trying\nhour. With a few exceptions every Indian, wherever he may be living, has\nwelcomed this step. Holding our head high that day we proudly proclaimed\n“we are Indians”. For that day in Pokhran, the might of the Nation\nmanifested itself along with nuclear energy.\n\nI wish to make it clear right now that India has always been an ardent\nadvocate of peace and will always remain so. We know and want to see\nweapons for self-defence only. We would never use atomic weapons for\nattacking anyone. Hence, we have put a self-moratorium on any new\nnuclear tests. We ourselves proclaimed to the world that we shall never be\nthe first user of atomic weapons. We are doing it neither under pressure\nnor fear of any one. We are doing it voluntarily because of our firm belief in\nworld peace and disarmament. Our dream is to see the world free from\nnuclear weapons and we want to see this dream come true. Initially, some\ncountries did not appreciate our national security policy needs and doubted\nour intention. Some of them imposed economic sanctions against us. But\nnow the situation is changing. The world is gradually appreciating the\nIndian viewpoint. We have been able to make them understand our\nposition. As a result, some of the sanctions have begun to ease. We\nwelcome this changing global attitude.\n\nHowever, we also want to make one point clear. India is a great country\nand its people are powerful. The brave people of our country are always\nready to face any danger to defend their honour. Our history bears\ntestimony to this. No force on earth can deflect us from our chosen path. I\nam saying this not out of arrogance but with humility and self-confidence.\nWe are willing to make any sacrifice to uphold the unity, integrity and\nsovereignty of our country. We wish to improve relations with our\nneighbours. We know that the easiest way to win a war is not to let it\nhappen. We are ready to hold talks with Pakistan on any subject, at any\nlevel and at anytime.\n\nYou all know that I have taken the initiative during the SAARC Conference\nin Colombo. I am somewhat unhappy that we did not get the desired\nresponse. Still I have not given up. I will make another effort at reviving the\ndialogue during the Conference of the Non-Aligned countries in South\nAfrica at the end of this month.\n\nI believe that all problems of the world can be solved through talks.\nTherefore whether it is Pakistan or China, we will endeavour to solve our\nmutual problems through friendly talks. In the last few days terrorise\nactivities have increased in Jammu and Kashmir. The massacre in\nHimachal Pradesh appears to be part of a bigger conspiracy. Such terrorist\nactivities everyday, from across the border, are like a proxy war.\nGovernment has taken these incidents very seriously. We are facing them\nwith all our might and we will not rest content until we have defeated these.\n\nTime for Retrospection\n\nWhether in personal or national life, the 51st anniversary is always a\ngolden opportunity to assess the past fifty years. It is also the time for\nretrospection and preparation for a leap into the 21st century. While making\nan assessment we most often commit mistakes, tend to undertake our\nachievements and magnify our shortcomings which result in gloom.\n\nSometimes, I see a growing tendency of pessimism in the country. There\nmay have been aberrations here and there but things have not gone that\nbad so as to defy solutions. Our scriptures say that only fools indulge in\nself-praise. But unnecessary self-condemnation is also like suicide. I want\nthat a realistic assessment of the last fifty years should be undertaken.\n\nNational Integration and Secularism\n\nWhen we attained Independence, some Western experts had forecast that\nwe were unfit for being a democracy and did not deserve freedom. They\nsaid we would soon disintegrate. But, today, we can say with pride that we\nhave not only safeguarded our integrity and independence but have also\nshown to the world how the biggest democracy can be governed. Almost all\nthe countries which gained freedom along with us have kept the democratic\ntradition alive. This is our 12th Lok Sabha and I am the 11th Prime Minister\nof India. We have seen over the years transformations taking place from\nthe tiniest village Panchayat to the Parliament. You all deserve credit for\nthis. Your political maturity in all these elections have baffled political\npundits. I congratulate you for this. Our democracy is safe as long as you\nremain vigilant.\nOn the occasion of the golden jubilee celebrations of our Independence,\nthe Nation has to address itself to the important fact that Independence,\nnational integration, democracy and secularism are complementary to each\nother.\n\nWe have to remain independent under all circumstances. An essential\ncondition for this is national unity. Democracy is necessary for national\nunity. Secularism and democracy are inseparable parts of national unity. I\nand my Government are committed to all these four elements.\n\nWe oppose communalism in any form. We will ensure full security of the\nminorities and guarantee their participation in development. We should\nnever forget that we are the citizens of one country. The boundaries of this\ncountry extend from Ladakh to Nicobar, from Garo Hills to Gilgit. Ours is a\ncountry whose civilisation and culture is more than five thousand years old.\nSuch a big country replete with varieties of language, faith, living and food\nhabits has resolved to achieve social and economic justice within the\nframework of democracy. Simultaneously, we cannot forget that we have to\nstrive to rid this democracy of aberrations. Our legislators behave in such a\nway in legislatures that even a schoolteacher would not tolerate system of\nGovernance through free debate. The opposition has the right to criticise\nand Government has the right to implement. The opposition and the\nGovernment are complementary to each other and adversaries.\n\nFearless and impartial voting has to be further strengthened. The electoral\nsystem has to be reformed to free it from casteism, violence, money power\nand other ills so that in the next century our system of governance is further\nrefined.\n\nTitle of “Food Providers”\n\nOnce upon a time, this country was a land of prosperity. The situation\ndeteriorated and we began to be counted among the poor nations of the\nworld. In the past few years our farmers and agricultural workers have\nworked very hard to make the country self-sufficient in foodgrain\nproduction. An army with an empty stomach cannot fight and a hungry\nnation cannot have a restful sleep. Our farmers have made the country\nself-sufficient to justify their being called “Food Providers”. I can only pray\nto God that He shower happiness on the “Food Providers”.\n\nThere is a shadow of sorrow in this happiness. Today the condition of our\n“Food Providers” has become difficult. I feel very pained that this year in\nsome states some farmers have had to commit suicide because they could\nnot bear the burden of their debts. I offer my condolences to the bereaved\nfamilies. As a tribute to these farmers I have taken a decision. The Crop\nInsurance scheme will be broadened, new crops will be brought within its\npurview and its geographical reach will be creased.\n\nA high-powered Commission will be formed to look into the real financial\ncondition of farmers and to improve their economic condition. I want to\nassure our farmer brothers who are the backbones of the Nation that they\nwill never suffer under this Government.\n\nEasy to Say, Hard to Achieve\n\nIn Orissa, hunger still stalks the people in places like Balangir, Kalahandi\nand Koraput. It is unimaginable that even 50 years after independence\nsome people are still stalked by hunger. I have told the Planning\nCommission that the outlay on the Employment Assurance Scheme in\nthese areas should be doubled. My efforts will be to ensure that no one\ndies of hunger. The country has made commendable progress in business,\nindustry and services. Some of our industries are making their mark on the\ninternational scene. I congratulate all the workers, employees, managers,\nindustrialists and businessmen for this achievement.\nBut we know that this achievement is only a stepping stone. It is not the\nattainment of the final goal which is to see the rise of India as an economic\nsuperpower. I know that saying this is much easier than doing it. For this,\nWe will need to follow the path of hard work, establish high standards and\ndepend on self-reliance. We will have to produce goods of international\nstandard, which can compete in the global markets. Economic reforms will\nhave to be speeded up. But we will not allow others to take undue\nadvantage of our liberalisation. We will implement infrastructure projects\nwith speed.\n\n“Swadeshi” does not mean an inward looking policy. The word has become\na global village. Each one is dependent on the other. In this open market\nsystem we can use our inner strength to stand up to global competition and\nI have faith that we will.\n\nThis 51st Independence Day is being celebrated not only in India but also\nround the world. Every person of Indian origin in every country is\ncelebrating this sacred occasion with joy and enthusiasm. I give my good\nwishes to every person of Indian origin round the globe on this occasion. In\nsome countries our brothers and sisters are watching it live on television.\n\nNon-Resident Indians (NRIs) have brought strength to the economies of\nthe nations where they have settled. Now they have an opportunity to\nstrengthen India’s economy. We have floated the Resurgent India Bond\n(RIB). Non-Resident Indians around the world are taking benefit of this\nopportunity. So far, the scheme has brought in Rs. 5,000 crore. I am\nconfident that Non-Resident Indians will take further advantage of this\nscheme.\n\nWe will have to solve these problems. I know that all of you, especially our\nsisters, are feeling the pinch of the rising prices of some commodities. I\nunderstand your problem. Nature is to be blamed more for this than the\nGovernment. But I know that by saying this your burden will not be\nlightened. The Finance Ministry and the State Governments will work\ntogether to combat the price rise. I also ask for the cooperation of traders.\nThey should not indulge in hoarding or profit- making. We will not hesitate\nin taking strong measures against such elements. I know that a number of\nfestivals are coming up in the next few days. My efforts will be able to see\nthat rising prices do not dampen your festive spirit.\n\nProblem of Corruption\n\nThe country faces another problem that of corruption which is eating into\nthe vitals of the country like cancer. We have decided to fight it. We have\nbegun the fight from the top. I have not even left out the Prime Minister\nfrom the ambit of the Lok Pal Bill, which was recently introduced in the Lok\nSabha. This has made clear our intentions to fight corruption at the highest\nlevel.\n\nAlong with this, we wish to fight corruption in the bureaucracy. Very soon, I\nwill initiate action to speed up work in the cell in the Prime Minister’s Office\n(PMO) which is looking into corruption cases against officials. Removal of\nunemployment is an important pledge in our National Agenda. It is affecting\nthe lives of everyone. Employment is the only way of fulfilling the basic\nneeds of the people. Creation of schemes for total employment is difficult,\nbut not impossible. But basic needs and services will have to be produced\nby the masses. Science and technology will have to be applied for this.\n\nGovernment has decided that ten crore people should get employment\nopportunities over the next ten years. This means that every year one crore\npeople should get employment opportunities. A task force will be set up for\nthis purpose and it will present its report soon.\n\nReservation for Women\n\nThe status of women is a good indicator to judge the progress of a modern\nsociety. We had promised to give women 33% reservation in Parliament\nand the Assemblies. We are sorry that we have not been able to fulfill this\nso far. We have already decided to provide free education to girls up to\ngraduation levels. Now we are going to take another major initiative. All\ngirls at the primary level will be provided books ins their curriculum free of\ncost. This will cost Rs. 550 crore to the Government.\n\nRajrajeshwari and Bhagyashree Yojana\n\nA new Insurance Scheme, “Rajrajeshwari” will be started to provide women\nthe economic security. Another insurance scheme, “Bhagyashree” will be\nstarted for girls. Both schemes will begin on Diwali Day this year. The\npremium for the scheme will be Re. 1 per month. And the policyholder will\nbe able to get Rs. 25,000 in case of emergency. The full details will be\nannounced soon.\n\nSpeed up Implementation of Reservation in Jobs\n\nReservation in jobs has already been provided to the Scheduled Castes,\nScheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes. However, implementation\nof these provisions is very slow. My Government’s efforts will be to speed\nup the implementation process and to fill the reservation quotas as quickly\nas possible. The administration will be made more sensitive and\naccountable to these classes.\n\nNational reconstruction Force\n\nYouth power is the strength of the nation. It is also the future of the nation.\nMany years ago I had read the words of Baba Amte ~Haath lage nirman\nmey, nahin mangne, marne.~ (Use your hands to create, not to ask or hit).\nThis is also our wish. The young girls and boys of India do not have to\nextend their hands before anyone, nor do they have to use their hands\nagainst anyone. They should only dedicate themselves to the task of\nnational reconstruction.\n\nFor this purpose, we have decided to form the National Reconstruction\nForce (Rashtriya Punarnirman Vahini) which will involve youth from 18 to\n35 years of age. This force will focus on basic services in the rural and\nagricultural sectors, protection of environment, mass movement for\npopulation, control, fight against drugs, spread of education, uplift of dalit\nand tribal women and in the field of sports, art and culture. These youth will\nalso get honorarium for their work. Initially this scheme will be implemented\nin some districts and finally will be extended all over the country.\n\nThis scheme will be launched on January 12, 1999 which is the Birth\nAnniversary of Swami Vivekanand and which is celebrated as the Youth\nDay. I call upon the young men and women of this country to donate one\nyear of their youth to rejuvenate the nation.\n\nGolden Jubilee Education Development Space\n\nSatellite Scheme\n\nThe next millennium is beckoning us. It will be century of Information\nTechnology. The greatest strength of India is its intellect. India has the third\nlargest trained manpower in the field of Science and Technology. We will\nhave to tap this strength. My Government has taken several new initiatives\nin the field of Information Technology. It is our ambition that the country\nshould become a super power in this field.\n\nKeeping this in view I am announcing a new initiative. Space is a new race\nan opportunity to look for innumerable possibilities in the coming century.\nSpace technology has many advantages, which India can utilise to meet\nthe aspirations of its younger generation. On the basis of the slogan “Jai\nVigyan”, my Government wants to fulfil the dreams of our youth. In this\ndirection we will start programmes on a new satellite named Swaran\nJayanti Vidya Vikas Antariksh Upagraha Yojana (Golden Jubilee Education\nDevelopment Space Satellite Scheme).\n\nThe first satellite of this programme - INSAT 3-B - will be assembled and\nlaunched before August 15, 1999 by the Indian Space Research\nOrganisation (ISRO) within a record time of less than twelve months. Six\ntransponders of this satellite will be available exclusively to execute\n“Operation Knowledge” which aims to provide computer, internet and\ncomputer based education to all the students of the country. All\nUniversities, engineering and medical colleges, research laboratories and\nother centres of higher learning particularly will be linked to the Information\nTechnology Network before the next Independence Day. This programme\nwill also fulfil the development related information needs of the states.\n\nEconomic and Social Independence\n\nToday 125th birth anniversary celebrations of Maharishi Aurobindo are\ncoming to a close. He visualized the spiritual, moral and cultural\nrenaissance of the country. Today we should pledge to fulfil his dreams.\n\nBharat Ratna Baba Saheb Ambedkar once said that political freedom is\nincomplete without economic and social freedom. Today, on our political\nIndependence Day we cannot forget this moot point. In the half-century\ngone by, we have been able to keep intact our political independence but\ncould not win the battle of economic and social independence. We have not\nbeen able to free the country from the clutches of poverty and\nunemployment. The stigma of illiteracy could not be erased. The monsters\nof casteism and communalism still are raising their ugly head. Today on\nIndia’s 51st Independence Day, let us pledge to win economic and social\nindependence.\n\nCauvery Accord\nIn the short tenure of my Prime Ministership, I have made an effort to take\neverybody along and I have practised the politics of consensus. Take the\nexample of Cauvery. There was dispute for years on sharing of Cauvery\nwater among Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Pondicherry. On some\noccasions, this dispute took a serious turn. Water is used to extinguish fire\nbut if water itself is on fire, what could be done! There is a solution. The\nsolution lies in maturity, harmony, tolerance, patriotism and a willingness to\nkeep others interest in mind. The recently concluded Cauvery Accord\nepitomises all this.\n\nIs it not surprising that a large amount of water of our rivers flows away into\nthe ocean, while we fight over our share of water? These disputes have\nbeen going on for years. This situation has to be changed. Our rivers,\nwhich link the states of the country, have to link the hearts of the\ncountrymen too. There is a need to formulate a National Water Policy. We\nhave promised to formulate such a policy. However, it is possible only with\neverybody’s cooperation and patience.\n\nNational Agenda for Governance\n\nMy Government has been seriously endeavouring to fulfil the promises\nmade in the National Agenda for Governance. Ours is a coalition and such\nGovernments have their own character which has to be faithfully adhered\nto. We have prepared a common programme that is the national agenda for\nour alliance. We have kept all contentious issues out of this arrangement.\nWe have always held national interest to be above the party and personal\ninterest.\n\nThe country is passing through a transitional phase today. Our political and\nadministrative system is facing a serious challenge. In such a situation\nevery party and every leader has to conduct himself with a sense of\nresponsibility. History will not forgive us for any action which hurts the\nnation.\nThe common man should also ponder over the existing political and\nadministrative set up. We are faced with some basic issues. Are frequent\nelections ins the interest of the country? Is it the nation’s interest to incur\nheavy expenditures on frequent elections?\n\nNo Compromise on Principles in Pursuit of Power\n\nI have been Prime Minister only for five months. We have a very thin\nmajority in the Lok Sabha. I am aware of the limitations of the coalition\nGovernment. I am also aware that in today’s system an innocent sage can\nbe hanged by the power hungry.\n\nI can assure you that I have never compromised on principles in pursuit of\npower and I will never do it. Being in power or out of power is the same for\nme. I had been in opposition for years and faithfully performed my duties.\nMy opponents have also commended it. Today, a poem of Dr. Shiv Mangal\nSingh Suman comes to mind:\n\n(I am not afraid of victory or defeat; whatever comes my way on the path of\nduty, I will accept it as it is and would no task for any favours).\n\nI wish to assure you that till my last breath I will neither ask for favours, nor\ngive up the path of struggle. I only need your support. I only need the\nblessings of one billion of my countrymen. There comes a moment in life\nwhen one stands at crossroads and ponders over the path to take.\n\n(Modesty is being enraged openly and pawn has beaten the queen, should\nI take one last gambit or leave it all, which path do I take?).\n\nThen I feel that I cannot go into oblivion leaving the challenges behind. I\nhave to struggle. Once again, I reiterate my pledge in your presence from\nthe ramparts of Red Fort.\n(I will not accept defeat and will start the struggle afresh. I will write and\nunwrite my own destiny and sing a new tune).\n\nThank you very much. Join me in saying:\n\nJai Hind"},{"year":1997,"pm":"I.K.

Vista International Publishing House, Delhi, India","text":"Fellow countrymen, Armed forces at the borders, brave soldiers of\nthe Army, Navy and Air Force, toiling farmers, Workers, my countrymen\nliving abroad and dear children.\n       I congratulate you all on the Golden Jubilee of the Nation's\nIndependence. I salute those martyrs whose sacrifice won Independence\nfor the country. My tributes especially to the family members of those\nwhose patriotism and sacrifice freed the country from the shackles of\nBritish imperialism and gave the country deliverance from century old\nslavery and humiliation. We salute the vanguard of freedom fighters whose\nefforts are recognised by the whole country.\n      On this occasion, I remember with gratitude those innumerable\nmartyrs who suffered in jail, in anonymity but who always nurtured the hope\nto see a free India. I don't know whether you have heard of Ashfaq, Bismil\nwho gave the message of supreme sacrifice while awaiting the gallows by\nsaying “Sarfaroshi ki tamanna”. (Urdu couplet) Bhagat Singh, Rajguru and\nSukhdev also had the same song on their lips when they were being led to\nthe gallows. I on behalf of the nation, salute them, today.\n      Last night, the President recalled the contribution of those great\nleaders whose sacrifices and leadership ended the slavery of hundreds of\nyears. The countrymen recall with gratitude the great leaders like Mahatma\nGandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, Abdul Gaffar Khan,\nNetaji Subash Kalam Chandra Bose, Sardar Patel, Babu Rajendra Prasad,\nC. Rajagopalachari and founder of our Constitution Dr. Babasaheb\nAmbedkar.\n      Today we remember those lakhs of families who suffered humiliation\nand lost their lives at the time of partition. Ours is an ancient civilization. In\nthese last fifty years, the culture of this country has been enriched further\nand this in itself reflects unity and secularism. Our country is moving\ntowards modernity while keeping its heritage intact. This is as old and\nancient, as it is young and vibrant. There is a certain attraction in this land\nwhereby people belonging to different cultures and languages were able to\nmingle freely and enrich our civilisation. The greatest contribution of this\ncountry to society is Democracy under which 50 crore voters elect their\nrepresentatives from Panchayat to Parliament. We are proud of our\nDemocracy. On this historic occasion, as I address you from the ramparts\nof the Red Fort, which has witnessed several historical events, history is\nunfolding before my eyes. As you must have seen last night the Members\nof Parliament were listening to the speech of Jawaharlal Nehru which was\ndelivered 50 years ago. Mahatma Gandhi's voice was inspiring the country,\nonce again. Netaji who was the symbol of sacrifice has said that freedom\nand sacrifice are synonymous. A new India was awakening with fresh\nhopes on 15th August, 1947. The first Prime Minister of the country Pt.\nJawaharlal Nehru had reiterated the plea given to the future generations by\nthe freedom fighters. This commitment which was towards the nation and\nits people.\n      Fifty years ago, while on the one hand in the Central Hall of the\nParliament the country was looking towards the future with hope on the\nother, it was witness to the menace of communalism at its worst in areas\nlike Punjab and Bengal which were partitioned. In the name of religion,\ninnocents were being stabbed, women folk were being openly humiliated\nand barbarism was at its height. Human values were nowhere in sight.\nLakhs of men and women, old and young and children including myself\nwere crossing the border from both sides with tears in the eye and smile on\nthe face, with no hope for the future and darkness behind. Even during this\npainful hour, we remembered Gandhiji who inspired us and showed the\npath of a secular democratic India even putting his life at stake. It was\nassumed and later confirmed by posterity that had we chosen some other\npath, the country could not have stayed united or progressed.\n      Ours is a country of diversities. We follow different religions and\nspeak different languages. Quite often our eating habits and life styles also\nvary. We have witnessed diverse aspects of history for the last several\ncenturies. The struggle for Independence has united all these diversities\ninto a firm chain. The slogan \"Unity in Diversity\" was inscribed firmly in our\nhearts. Every word of this meant sacrifice, patriotism and a firm faith in\ndestiny.\n       Gandhiji raised a unique army of soldiers who had no weapons and\nthey were forbidden from even talk about violence. This was a new\ndefinition of valour given by Gandhiji. People's faith in Gandhiji led the\nlawyers to give up practice, students left their schools and colleges and\nstarted filling up jails. Farmers left their fields and labourers their factories.\nIn the last days of the struggle, things came to such a peak that the youth\nworking with the Indian Navy also revolted. The country was witnessing a\nnew kind of revolt. The roots of imperialism were shaken in the face of this\nstruggle.\n       I take pride in this fact and I wish to reiterate that the freedom was\nwon by the common man of this country -- it was not gifted. It is for this\nreason when the Constitution of India was framed, its opening line said,\n\"We, the people of India give to ourselves this Constitution\". This\nconstitution and this great country gave us the democracy, fundamental\nrights which enshrined equality of religion, caste, creed and gender and it is\nunder this democratic system that 36 crore people exercised their franchise\nin the previous elections, a shining example of the largest democracy of the\nworld. Gradually the African and Asian nations started attaining freedom.\nBritish imperialism started losing ground after India's independence and we\nwitnessed the last chapter of British imperialism closing recently in Hong\nKong.\n       The struggle for independence started from this Red Fort in 1867 and\nlater the British imperialists prosecuted the brave soldiers of INA in this\nvery same Fort. Netaji Subash Chandra Bose gave the slogan \"Lal Qila\nChalo\". Lal Qila became the symbol of India's struggle for freedom. The\nfreedom fighters used to sing \"Kadam Kadam Badhaye Ja, Yea Zindagi hai\nQuam ki, Tu quam pe lutaye ja\".\n       Today while addressing you from the ramparts of the same fort and\nlook back at the history with pride, I also want to speak to you about the\nfuture of the nation. When Gandhiji dreamt of India's future, he had said\nthat the country will attain the real freedom only on the day when a Dalit\nwould become the President of this country. This is our great fortune that\ntoday on the eve of golden jubilee of independence, we have been able to\nfulfil this dream of Gandhiji. In the person of Shri K.R. Narayanan we have\nbeen able to fulfil the dream of Gandhiji. Our President of whom the whole\ncountry is proud of, is from a very poor and downtrodden family and today\nhe has endowed the Rashtrapati Bhawan with a new pride and respect. It is\na matter of further happiness that the President has a very high place\namong the intellectuals of this country. This is a feather in the cap of our\ndemocracy that the backward sections of the society today are attaining\ntheir rightful place in society. All the countrymen today whether they are\nfrom minorities, scheduled castes or scheduled tribes are working unitedly\nfor the development of the country.\n       Women constitute an important part of our society. Our religions and\ncultures put the women folk on a very high pedestal but I am constrained to\nsay it, with a sense of sorrow and regret that our politics, apparently, is\nhesitating in giving the women a place of equality, There was a revolution a\nfew days back in the Panchayat Raj elections, about one lakh women\nrightfully became the leaders of Panchayats and Municipal Corporations.\nWhen I go to any city and meet the lady mayor or the lady sarpanch, I feel\nvery happy and proud. In this I also see the future of India. These days we\nare trying and I want to reiterate the promise which I made in Parliament to\ngive women their rightful place in the country's politics. We must remember\nthat unless and until women are given their rightful place, no society or\ncountry can progress. Women should get the equal place in every field\nwhether in the political, economic or social arena.\n       It is very unfortunate that even today in some families when a girl\nchild is born, they feel bad about it. Unfortunately, some families get the girl\nchild aborted when they learn about it in advance. My government has\nformulated two policies to stop this menace. The first is that doctors have\nbeen legally prohibited from revealing the sex of the child in the womb. The\nsecond policy is perhaps more important, that the government, from today,\nitself will give financial help to the families to whom a girl child is born, if\nthey are living below the poverty line. Later scholarship will be given when\nthe girl child starts going to school.\n      I appeal to all countrymen and political and social institutes and also\nto those women who have been recently elected in the Panchayats to work\nunitedly to change the atmosphere in the country so that small girls are\nlooked after well. They should get full opportunity to blossom and men and\nwomen should have equal place in society. This country will become great\nonly when the men and women of this country work unitedly and take the\ncountry ahead.\n        I would also like to say that whether they are boys or girls, unless and\nuntil our future generations go to school, the society cannot make further\nprogress. My government has already acceded the right to education as a\nfundamental right for every child and we have presented the amendment\nbill in the Parliament. The next scheme is to open more schools and raise\nthe standard of education. Our country will have a bright future only when\nevery child below 14 years will go to school every morning wearing a\ncolourful uniform. The children should not be deprived of childhood joys\nand should not be forced to labour. That is why I want to emphasise that all\nof you should contribute your mite in this endeavour of government.\n       Now, with great sorrow and seriousness I want to draw your attention\ntowards the ill of this country which is called corruption. Corruption is eating\ninto the vitals of the country. The country is in greater danger from those\nwho occupy higher offices and betray the nation by accepting bribes. If the\ncountry's enemies attack us from outside, our gallant army is capable of\nfacing them and they put their lives at stake in the most difficult\ncircumstances. But if somebody from inside becomes a traitor by accepting\nbribes and betrays the nation, he creates a greater danger to the country.\nThe corruption is rampant everywhere. It seems that whether it is a matter\nof government purchases, paying of taxes, paying of custom duties, some\npeople think and that corruption is their birthright. I make a promise to you\nthat the long arms of law will be further strengthened to ensure that no one\nwho accepts bribes escapes the grip of the law. I take it as my first and\nforemost duty and also as a promise to the nation that an accused, whether\nhe belongs to politics or government would not be exonerated if he\ncommits such a sin.\n      It is all the more unfortunate that common men face more difficulties\nbecause of petty corrupt practices. Even the slightest of work cannot be\ncompleted without bribing somebody, whether it is a police station, a village\npatwari, municipality, an electric station, telephone department or the\nrevenue department. Everywhere the sin of corruption is there. The\ncommon man especially the poor and the middle class just feel helpless.\nOn several occasion, I have seen this feeling of helplessness written large\non their faces.\n      The nexus between corrupt and politics has taken a turn for the\nworse today when criminals are entering politics. When I see the dark\nclouds ahead, I feel more determined to eliminate this challenge of\ncorruption. All of us will have to work unitedly to eradicate corruption.\nGovernment alone will not be able to do this work. When the cancer\nworsens we all have to pay attention towards it.\n      The first thing which we have to do is electoral reforms which are\nbeing discussed for a long time now. Some work has been done in this\nregard but that is not enough and perhaps will not be able to meet the\nobjectives. Corruption will prevail till the day when money is collected in the\nname of fighting elections. Therefore, complete reforms are imperative. The\nsecond thing towards which I have drawn your attention is the\ncriminalisation of politics. Criminals are aligning with the political parties\nand I am here to break the nexus with courage and determination. I\nhonestly believe that every political party finds fault with the others but\noverlooks its own greater faults. If a goonda belongs to the other political\nparty we consider him a goonda but if he belongs to party we make him sit\nby our side and give him respect and regard. Legally we have to meet this\nchallenge but simultaneously I call upon all political parties to do a soul\nsearching. This is the biggest challenge before politics and the politician,\ntoday, if he has to become the leader of tomorrow. Last week I had been to\nMumbai to the anniversary of 9th August. There I had said something\nwhich I want to repeat today. The bribe takers should not be allowed to\nescape the law but we, who are compelled to offer bribes should take a\npledge and start a new type of satyagraha-non-cooperation — and assert\nthat we would not give bribes whatever be the difficulties and delays. It will\nbe a new form of satyagraha.\n       This satyagraha can take us very far. Today we do not have any\nleader of the stature of Mahatma Gandhi but all of us can unitedly achieve\nthis objective. The philosophy of Gandhiji is today inspiring us to form\ncommittees in localities, villages and cities to help each other so that those\nwho give bribe and those who take bribe come out of this compulsion. I\ndon't know whether some of you remember this or not, I have seen this with\nmy own eyes that when Gandhiji had started salt satyagraha, people had\ntheir doubts about its outcome and they use to question how it was\npossible to remove imperialism by making salt. I recall that when my father\ndecided to join the salt satyagraha, his fellow lawyers told him that you are\na literate person whereas Gandhi is an old man and he has lost his senses.\nThey used to ask if it were possible to make British imperialism give way by\nmaking salt. But Gandhiji had confidence in himself. He was a farsighted\nman. People followed him. The issue which had started from a handful of\nsalt ended with the end of British rule, from this very Red Fort.\n       I give you my word that my government shall not compromise with\ncorruption, in any kind of circumstances and I call upon you to help me in\nthis task. There was a time when taking bribe would lead to social boycott.\nIt was a matter of great insult if anybody aligned his name with a\nbribe-taker. All of us should work unitedly to create an atmosphere in the\nsociety, which would emphasise that we do not vote for the corrupt, we do\nnot keep any kind of relationship with any criminal and we do not give any\nrespect to such persons in society.\n      The struggle for the country's independence achieved success when\nthe youth joined it. There was enthusiasm in that commitment and the\nsame commitment and will to sacrifice led the nation to the freedom. Today\nonce again, I call upon you to join this new struggle against corruption.\nThere are some aspects of corruption which relate to the government\npolicies. My government has taken a decision that whenever there is a big\ngovernment purchase, whether it is of defence or some other department,\nits procedure should be very transparent so that people do not have any\ndoubt about it. You must have noticed that a few days back, our Defence\nMinister had announced the formation of a committee which will approve\nthe purchases of arms and fighter planes and other defence equipment.\nThe members of this committee are people of the highest integrity and the\ncountry have full faith in them. Such committees should be formed in all\nMinistries and departments who make large purchases. This committee\nshould work in an open way so that people can see that there are no\nkickbacks involved. There should be nothing in it which even the slightest\nmeasure smells of corruption.\n       A few days back, all the Chief Ministers from all over the country had\ncome to Delhi on my invitation. They had all unitedly had decided that we\nwill give Right to Information to our people through a new law. Under this\nRight, every citizen will have the right to seek information on any of the\ncontract or purchases. None of the contracts or purchases would be\nconcealed behind the veil of the Official Secrecy Act. This Right to\nInformation law is already under formulation and would be presented in the\nnext session of Parliament. I have also advised the Chief Ministers to form\nspecial courts to expeditiously deal with corruption cases. Some states\nhave already done it but others have not. This is a very important task and I\nhave also prayed to the Supreme Court to help us in punishing the corrupt.\n      My government has formed a National Commission which would\nrecommend abolition of outdated laws which are not required now and will\nsuggest reforms in the present laws to ensure early settlement of cases in\ncourts. The Civil Code and the Penal Code should be changed so that\ncases do not remain in the court files for long years.\n      The Lok Pal Bill will be presented in the next session of Parliament\nand this will act as another watch tower on official deals. I have noticed that\nthere are several cases before the CBI which have not yet been opened\nand enquiries are continuing. I have told the officers that such cases should\nbe resolved expeditiously.\n       Another thing which I want to tell you, is that if any of you have a\nproof against any Minister in my Cabinet, you please come forward and\ngive it to me. I give you my word that I would order a thorough enquiry into\nthe complaint without caring for the status of the person concerned and\naction would be taken against him under the law. We will not let such\npersons remain in politics.\n      My countrymen, the Indian community today is emerging as a big\neconomic giant before the world, after the hard work of fifty long years.\nEarlier, even the needle for sewing clothes used to be imported. I recall that\nbefore partition, there was a very rich businessman in Karachi who made a\nbig fortune by importing needles. Today, when we take a look at our\nindustries and factories, we raise our head with pride on our achievements\nin these 50 years.\n      We attained political freedom 50 years ago and today, we have to\nmarch forward towards economic freedom. Our schemes including the 9th\nFive Year Plan which will come before you in a few days' time will lead the\ncountry towards the goal of economic independence. The 50 years hard\nwork of our countrymen has borne fruit. Today the world considers India as\na very big market, a market not for only purchasing goods but market\nbecause of our industries. Our labourers and our farmers are taking the\ncountry on the path of economic progress by their hard work. Today no\ncountry in the world can remain isolated. The United Front government has\nformulated a Common Minimum Programme. This programme is\nmultifaceted and our effort is to touch upon those sectors of the economy\nwhere some kind of stalemate has crept in. You are all aware and you\nremember that in the last fifty years this country has strived to set up a\nlarge number of Public Sector Units. Some companies are facing problems\nand we are trying to resolve those. Ever since I have taken over I have paid\nspecial attention to Public Sector and where there was talk of closing down\nten big companies, they have been revived. My policy is that as far\npossible, Public Sector Companies should be infused with fresh life so that\nthe country increases its wealth and the people's prosperity.\n     Today, whether it is Delhi or outside, within the country or city we\nunderstand that new roads need to be built. Industries have to increase for\nwhich the infrastructure issues like Power, Post & Telegraph and\nTelecommunications have to be addressed. Unless we do so our economy\nmay not be able to progress. That is why the United Front Government is\nfocussing and stressing on these issues. I am proud to state that our\neconomy grew at a rate of nearly 7% last year.\n       This has happened for the first time in our history that as we attain\nnew objectives and now we aim even higher. We strive and aspire that\ntogether, with the efforts of labourers and farmers our growth rate should\nmove towards 10%. Ours is primarily an agricultural economy. The real\nstrength of the country is the farmer, his effort and production. In the last 50\nyears our foodgrain production has increased 4 times. Import of foodgrains\nfor the people is the thing of the past. Our population has increased\ntremendously but I am grateful to the farmer for making us self-sufficient in\nfood-grains. You will be happy to know that with the efforts of our farmers,\nour food-grain production was 20 crore tonnes, last year. This includes both\nrice and wheat. Our country has experienced both green and white\nrevolutions. Due to the white revolution, India today is the world's biggest\nproducer of milk. Our focus today is to improve agriculture production. That\nis why the areas that receive scanty rainfall need special attention. In areas\nwhere agriculture is totally dependent on rainfall - dryland farming, the\nstress is on improving agricultural production by using science and\ntechnology. We have to do a lot for the hard working farmers, so we have\ndecided to give special emphasis on the welfare of agricultural labour\nespecially landless labourers. Since he is backward and in extreme poverty\nthere is need for his insurance so that in case of his unfortunate demise,\nhis family members do not lack food. In the field of agricultural reforms\nthere are some more issues which are under consideration and we will try\nto introduce a Bill in the next session of Parliament.\n        The slogan of “Garibi Hatao\" was given a long time back. The policy\nof my Government is how to translate it into reality. Today I have said that\nin our agricultural economy around 60 to 65% people are dependent on\nagriculture. It is with extreme sadness that I say that the land reforms have\nnot been implemented honestly. Our country cannot progress unless the\npeople who actually work on fields get the land and until the landless\nfarmer is able. Therefore, I exhort you, especially those states where land\nreforms have not been implemented to lay stress on this and to formulate\nsuch a programme that within the next one or two years will translate this\ninto reality. Poverty and illiteracy are two sides of the same coin and they\nshould be eradicated. The welfare of the labourer and poor classes should\nnot be promoted not only with agriculture but by setting up of cottage and\nsmall scale industry. Unemployment especially of the educated\nunemployed needs to be addressed. It has only one solution and that is\neconomic progress and advance. I assure you that our next plan would lay\nstress on this. Eradication of illiteracy is another essential ingredient for the\ndevelopment of the country. The nation cannot progress long as its people\nare illiterate. Somebody has once which I would like to repeat that \"Tell me\none country where people are literate and is backward; and tell me one\ncountry where people are illiterate and the country has moved forward”.\n        Today we are concentrating on this. I remember the days when I was\nin college and Gandhiji had raised the slogan of “Each one teach one\". The\ncountry would greatly benefit if each person - whether he is studying,\nworking in an office or doing some job in the village decides to teach one\nilliterate in a year. I invite you to contribute in this mission. There are some\nstates in our country which have experienced this revolution. We can talk of\nKerala, Andhra Pradesh, Mizoram and Tamil Nadu to a great extent, areas\nwhere we have grappled with illiteracy and it has resulted in decreasing\npopulation rate. An educated woman contributes greatly in this mission. If\nan educated woman understands how the growing population can be\nstopped, how families can be kept small the danger to our development\ndue to population explosion can be stopped.\n       A short while ago I was talking of science & technology. The Green\nRevolution of our country was the direct result of this technology. It is a\nmatter of pride that thanks to our scientists we can both make and launch\nour satellites. There is a new future for the youth of today and science,\ntechnology and computer show a new path. I recall Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru's\nstatement that it is not enough for everyone to become a scientist or\ntechnologist, it is more important to inculcate a scientific temper among our\nchildren and youth. When a child switches on an electric bulb and asks how\nit functions he should not be scolded. He should be made to understand\nhow electricity is produced and used. When a child acquires a questioning\nnature, scientific temper is created and it will eliminate the era of\nsuperstitions.\n       Long ago Lord Buddha had said that the people should not have blind\nfaith in anything. Do not believe because I am saying so. Also do not\nbelieve that it is written in a book. Question everything -- what, why, how,\nwhen, these questions raise our thought process would change and the\ncountry will progress. Today I am proud to share with you that, where 10\nyears ago this country had pledged its gold to import petrol, today we have\nthree thousand crore dollars. This is our hard earned money. Our\nbusinessmen have earned it. Our industrialists have earned it. Our\nexporters have earned it and a large portion of it has come from the people\nwho closely watch the economic developments and invest when they find\ntheir capital adequately safe. A substantial contribution has come from\nnon-resident Indians.\n      Today, we all envisage a new future for the country. I am reminded of\nGandhiji's statement which said that he would consider the country to be\nfree when he can wipe the tears from every eye. It is true that we have\nwiped some tears. But we cannot honestly say that today there are no tears\nin the eyes of our millions. Today therefore, the major issue before me is\nhow to eradicate poverty. The poverty of scheduled castes, scheduled\ntribes and those below the poverty line irrespective of their religion or faith.\nSo we need to lay special emphasis on such programmes and plans. As I\nwas mentioning earlier, at the time of independence, our population was 32\ncrores and in these 50 years it has increased 3 folds. It is possible that it\nwill touch 100 crores in the coming few years. It is a fact that despite the\nincrease in population, there is food for everybody. We have to give special\nattention to those who still remain below the poverty line -- whether they\nare one third or 25%. We have to try and control the growing population\nand there are very strong reasons for this. The biggest reason is poverty\nbecause poverty, illiteracy and low status of women lead to an increase in\npopulation. The Government will present a national population policy and\ndraft a new law for the same. Today my attention is drawn to slums where\npeople live in extremely dirty surroundings. Similarly, pollution which is\nharming the health of our children is a cause for concern. Some years ago I\nhad visited Sweden. At that time we felt that poverty alone breeds pollution.\nToday we have seen our country falling into a vicious circle. On the one\nhand, pollution breeds poverty and on the other hand prosperous people\nare causing greater pollution. Their cars emit smoke. They do not pay\nattention to this and do not object to accumulating filth in their\nsurroundings. Therefore, if we all do not come together and try to break this\nvicious circle; if we do not fight against pollution the country will not be rid\nof filth and disease. The Government has framed a lot of policies for\ncleaning the rivers and lakes. These policies have succeeded to an extent\nbut still a lot of work remains to be done. But I emphasise that if the\nGovernment keeps cleaning rivers and we keep polluting them, the\npurpose will be defeated. So we should awaken the people to launch an\nanti-pollution campaign and see to it that industries do not emit pollutants.\nNeither should fertilizers and insecticides be used in such a way that the\nground water is polluted and it becomes difficult to get clean drinking water.\nThis is why there is a shortage of clean drinking water. Though we have\nhad a comprehensive environment policy, my topmost priority and foremost\nchallenge on the 9th Plan is to provide clean drinking water to everyone.\n     The weaker sections of society and I am especially referring to \"safai\nkarmacharis” are today the most backward sections of society. They have\nbeen denied\nsocial justice so far. The Government has established a \"safai karmachari”\nCommission to look into this. The Government is also trying to remove\ndifficulties of night soil workers. Our attention is especially focussed on\n\"safai karmacharis”. Our attention is and will be on the backward sections\nand their upliftment. It is then that they will achieve economic\nindependence. This independence will come when people from the\nbackward classes; safai karmacharis, scheduled castes and scheduled\ntribes, receive a place of respect in society. You may have seen that in\nmany Government offices there is extravagant expenditure. I have decided\nto set up a new Commission to look into this.\n      I wish to spend a few minutes on India's foreign policy. You know that\nthe foundations of our foreign policy were laid during our freedom struggle\nby Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru. About Gandhiji it was always\nsaid that he was born in India, but his political birth took place in Africa.\nThat is why we have had strong emotional relations with the nations of\nblack Africa. When our independence came 50 years ago it was said that\nthe winds of change would also sweep Africa and the rest of Asia. And\nindeed, soon, one by one the countries of Africa and Asia threw off the\nyoke of colonialism. These new independent nations came together to\ncreate an organisation called NAM. Our foreign policy was started by\nJawaharlal Nehru. He said an independent nation's foreign policy should\nalways be independent. That is why India has never been part of any bloc.\nWhen the world has been divided into various blocs India made sure that it\ndid not get involved in bloc politics. We are proud of our non-aligned foreign\npolicy.\nYou may remember that I refused to sign the CTBT, and even today we are\nfirm on this issue. We will not sign the CTBT under pressure and until the\nnuclear weapon states destroy their stockpiles. I can proudly say that I\nhave given a new direction to our foreign policy. This policy has been\nreferred to by the media and intellectuals as the Gujral doctrine. Under the\ndoctrine we wish to improve relations with our neighbours, and we are\nprogressing towards this. But we have to keep one thing in mind, that while\nrelations can be improved we will not compromise on our security. Our\narmed forces have proved many a time that they can defend the nation if\nfaced by an outside threat. Our history shows that we have never lost in\nwars because our people were not brave. Whenever we lost it was\nbecause we did not have the state of the art weapons. If our opponent had\ncanons we fought with swords, and this was a mismatch. Our soldiers\ncould only die displaying the highest bravery, our women folk could commit\njauhar. I give my promise, we will never allow this to happen again. I\npromise our Navy, Air Force and Army that they will not remain\ntechnologically backward, and they can face the enemy eye to eye. Our\nscientists and technologists are today able to produce weapons which we\ndo not have to buy from abroad. The cold war has ended. Inimical forces\nare becoming friendly today. Therefore our foreign policy lays stress on\nregional cooperation with countries in South Asia.\n       The region can stand the world if we move forward with the spirit of\nsharing. You have witnessed development of new friendly relations with\nBangladesh. Our relations with Sri Lanka have also improved. Our\ntraditional relationship with Nepal has been further rejuvenated. New levels\nof friendship have been established with the States of Bhutan and\nMaldives; an environment of friendliness is emerging. We have raised the\nconcept of regional cooperation. Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan and the Indian\nStates neighbouring Assam can help each other in progress and this area\nwhich was lagging behind in development since partition can move forward.\n       I am happy to announce that recently Nagaland has started its march\ntowards peace. Ceasefire has been agreed after 30 years of militancy and I\nam hopeful that in the days to come peace would be restored in the entire\nNorth-eastern region. But one thing should be clear to all of us that there\nwould be no compromise with terrorism. People using arms will be strictly\ndealt with. The country is eager to welcome back the misguided youths ....\nThey are our brethren and children and if they give up arms and ask for\ntheir right, we will ensure them.\n        Today, I would like to refer to Pakistan also. Recently, Indo-Pak\nrelationship have improved a bit. It is a matter of satisfaction to a level. We\nhave already had Secretary-level talks and efforts are on to have a second\nround next month. Today after years of confrontation both sides have taken\ninitiatives towards the establishment of peace. Indo-Pak friendship would\nbenefit the two countries. It will in fact benefit the entire South-East region\nand would enable the Seven Nations in the region to open a front against\npoverty and backwardness. I want to state on behalf of India that we want\nto establish good friendly relations with the countries of the region including\nPakistan. But we must accept that if friendly relations can be established\nonly when we do not interfere in the internal affairs of each other and\nterritorial sovereignty of each country is honoured. Today, India has the\ncapability to protect its national independence, unity and integrity and there\nwould be no compromise on secular unity and integrity.\n       We want friendship while protecting our territorial integrity. It is a\nmatter of happiness that the situation has changed in the State of Jammu\nand Kashmir. We have succeeded in uprooting terrorism there. Today the\ndemocratically elected Government is in operation. I take satisfaction on\nstating that after five to seven years of terrorism, Kashmir has come out of\nthe dark. The success was achieved only after the people of the State\nincluding women, youth from both Hindus and Muslims set up a front\nagainst terrorism. I, therefore request my neighbouring countries to take a\npledge not to interfere in the internal affairs of each other and to honour\neach others' borders. I want to reiterate that India is willing to offer a\nnumber of concessions to the neighbouring countries for their economic\nprosperity but there can be no compromise on the issues of sovereignty,\nterrorism and secular unity. Our foreign policy has led to further\nimprovement of relationship with neighbouring countries. Our relationship\nwith the countries of Asia and Africa, Russia, Japan and China and Korea\nhave improved. The relationship with China is also improving. You have\nwitnessed emergence of better relationship with the European powers.\nEuropean powers are today making heavy investments in our country. Our\nrelations with the Americans are old and friendly. Our economic ties with\nAmerica have been strengthened and we intend to further improve them.\n      I want to give a message to the overseas Indians - they are living far\naway from the motherland and are proud of the achievements of India and\nhave great love for their motherland. My Government would extend fresh\nconcessions to the Non Resident Indians. These would include\nconcessions in visa, acquiring of property and children education so as to\nfurther strengthen the emotional ties. Before I conclude, I once again\ncongratulate my countrymen.\nBefore concluding, and I am saying this to those friends who may not have\nunderstood me in the language in which I was talking, I only want to say\nthat I greet you all on this very happy occasion when India is finishing half a\ncentury of its Republic and entering into a new era, an era of progress, an\nera of peace, an era of leadership in which it wants to be a foremost\ncountry in economic development, in industrial development, agricultural\ndevelopment. It also wants to be an example in the world over in social\njustice. It wants to uplift all those sections of society which have not been\ngiven their fair deal. We shall give them a fair deal.\n       And may I also repeat what I have said at length in Hindi that our war\nagainst corruption is wholehearted, honest and candid and for this we have\nto build a massive movement in which we all can join so that corruption,\nboth in politics, politicians and also in public life, ends. And at the same\ntime, this movement must focus on small corruption, in police station, in\nvillages, in government offices where we must start a new type of\nSatyagrah, that Satyagraha - non-cooperation with the ones who are\ncorrupt; refusing to give into corruption. It needs courage. Sometimes, it is\ndifficult but it is daring. Gandhiji's main heritage is this: That non\ncooperation can achieve wonders. Let us achieve it once again.\n      And also on this occasion, once again, I want to express my feelings\nof gratitude to the freedom fighters and also on behalf of the nation I want\nto thank them and also appreciate their sacrifices. I want to tell them with a\nsense of gratitude that the United Front Government has decided that\nwhatever small, meagre - what is called pension is given to them, it is being\ndoubled from today. And also it is being linked with the DA Index so that if\nthe prices go up, so shall their pension. I hope, and I pray that the veteran\nfreedom fighters will accept the nation's small gift on this happy day.\n     Last year, standing from here, my worthy colleague Shri Deve\nGowdaji had made a promise about Uttarakhand. I want to restate that\npromise. We will take the needed steps in this direction very soon.\nAnd in the end, once again, our attention to national unity, to secularism, to\nour shared civilisation, to our common civilisation, “Sanjhi Sanskriti”\n“Mustaqa Ganga Jamuni Tehzeb”.\n       We, the 96 crore Indians, professing different languages, living in\ndifferent parts of India, having different historical division, we are one. We\nshall remain one.\n      We are all moving together and are now standing on the threshold of\ngreatness. India is about to enter this new edifice of greatness which is\nwaiting for us. It is waiting for our future, younger generation.\n      So today, let us come together and pledge to build a nation which will\nbe united in spite of the diversities, different languages, are there but it will\nremain united. We will follow our faith, our own religions but will remain\nunited. We will end class differences. We will build a nation where there will\nbe no lower class or upper class, a nation where women will be honoured.\nAnd they will get their due.\n      We shall make a country, a country of equals; a country which is\nsocially just; a country where woman gets her status, where the scheduled\ncastes and scheduled tribes and minorities occupy a place of primacy.\n     So the same song comes to my mind which we sang yesterday night.\n“Sare Jahan se Achha, Hindustan Hamara”. And before concluding this\nspeech, all of you would join me with full strength to say “Jai Hind”."},{"year":1996,"pm":"H.D.

Vista International Publishing House, Delhi, India","text":"Brothers and sisters and dear countrymen, my greetings to all of you\non the Independence Day. I will attempt to speak to you in Hindi. I\nremember as a student being inspired by the address of Pandit Jawaharlal\nNehru from this historie Red Fort on this very day. He described himself as\nthe first servant of the Indian people. I stand before you as a humble\nservant of the nation.\n      I come from a small farmer's family. I never imagined that I would\naddress the nation as Prime Minister from Red Fort. It is a tribute to our\nConstitution and democratic process that this opportunity has been given to\nme - a farmer's son.\n      Mahatma Gandhi's call for freedom struggle evoke warm response\nfrom the people in our country belonging to regions, identities and\npersuasions. He won independence us. On this day we pay homage to all\nthe leaders and of our freedom movement.\n    We must remember the sacrifice of the Father of Nation. The way\nGandhiji led the freedom movement, it\nbrought oneness to the nation. The beauty of this unity is that it is not only\ngeographical or historical, it is based upon the conviction that this nation\nbelongs to all its people and its plural and secular character.\n      Century after century the word “Bharat” has evinced this oneness and\nIndian identity in every language in the country and in the heart of every\nIndian. A Sanskrit composition, which is known throughout the country\nreads -- Tham varsham Bharatam, Bharatiya Yatra Santati -- Those who\ndwell within this great land, whatever be their creed or colour, whatever\nmay be their religion, all belong to this country. They are all Indians.\n      This is our heritage, this is our history, and this is our civilization.\n      Whenever we surrendered this oneness - which is based on the\nprinciples of pluralism and secularism - and resorted to fanaticism, our\ncountry suffered and declined. The greatest need now, as in the past, is to\nfoster tolerance and goodwill among all our countrymen.\n      We have formulated a Common Minimum Programme to run our\ngovernment.\n       In this programme, we have resolved that we will take important steps\nfor the prosperity of our country and improvement of the living standards of\nthe people.\n      I come from rural India where most of our brothers and sisters live. I\nhave seen poverty and deprivation from close quarters. I know the\nproblems of the common man. I deem it a privilege and duty to launch this\nnew agenda.\n     Our Government has resolved that we will make special efforts to\nimprove the quality of life of our rural people.\n       Our government is truly in consonance with the glorious Indian\ntradition and heritage. Our democracy is mature enough to provide a stable\nand strong Government within the federal culture and polity.\n       The Government is based on federalism, decentralisation and social\njustice and we will ensure the dignity of both the nation and every citizen.\n     It is the duty of every citizen of India to update and protect the\nsovereignty, unity and integrity of India. It is the duty of each one of us to\npreserve the rich heritage of our composite culture.\n       The Government will take all steps to ensure that harmonious\nrelations are maintained between different communities and groups.\n     We are committed to protecting the lives and property of all the\npeople, particularly the weaker sections and the minorities.\n     I visited Punjab recently and was impressed by the determination with\nwhich it had fought terrorism and kept the wheels of progress moving. I\ncongratulate the brave and enlightened people of Punjab on this\nachievement.\n       I am deeply disturbed by a few recent incident ethnic violence and\navoidable conflicts between different sections of society, in which some of\nour brethren and sisters - even children lost their lives. My heart goes out to\ntheir families. We shall provide them with all support and sustenance\nbearing with their tragic loss.\n      Violence manifesting itself in separating extremist, criminal and\nanti-social activities has no place in our society. It will be firmly dealt with by\nthe Government.\n      Jammu & Kashmir is an integral, part of India and will remain so\nforever. The people of Jammu & Kashmir are our own people, they are\nIndians. This situation prevails from centuries.\n      You are aware, the problems in Kashmir are entirely those created by\nexternal forces.\n     There should be no doubt in any quarter about our resolve to\npreserve the territorial integrity of India.\n      I visited Jammu and Kashmir twice and met the people of the State,\nand felt their aspirations. The conditions are changing there. The holding of\nelections to Parliament in Jammu & Kashmir is a triumph of our democratic\nvalues. The people of Jammu & Kashmir have demonstrated their maturity\nand wisdom by rejecting militancy abetted from across the border.\n      Building on these positive developments and mood of the people, we\nare holding the assembly elections in the State next month.\n     We will complete the task of restoration of normalcy and return of a\npopular Government in Jammu & Kashmir.\n     The North-Eastern region of India requires special attention and\nsupport in the containment of violence, ethnic strife and insurgency.\n     Efforts will be made for the well-being of the people of the area and\nredressal of their grievances.\n     Firm steps will be taken to check the inflow of foreign migrants and\narms together with effective administration.\n      In our view, providing clean and efficient administration is the need of\nthe hour and all of us should be committed to this goal.\n     Probity and accountability have to be the key norms in public life and\ngovernance.\n       The primary task is to reduce as much as possible the scope for\narbitrary and discretionary decision making.\n      Our procedures should be made simpler and more transparent.\n      We have begun taking steps to fulfill our commitments to provide a\ncorruption free and clean administration.\n      Our mechanisms and agencies for combating corruption have to be\nstrengthened and made more effective.\n      Corruption, especially in high places is rightly a matter of widespread\nconcern among the people. We must build and strengthen the institutions\nthat would deter corruption and restore the confidence of the common man\nin our democratic system.\n      The proposal to appoint a Lok Pal has been discussed for several\nyears. We are making this institution a reality by introducing a Bill in the\nParliament.\n      We are committed to bringing about sweeping reforms in our election\nsystem. We will examine all important suggestions that have been made for\nelectoral reforms. The aim of these reforms should be to eliminate the role\nof money and muscle power, removal of other unfair practices and ensuring\naccountability of the political parties.\n      As a beginning we have made amendments in electoral laws which\nprovide for deterrent punishments for some electoral offences such as\nbooth capturing, discourages non-serious candidates and reduce the\ncampaign period.\n      Formation of a separate state is a long pending demand of the people\nof Uttarakhand. Our Government has taken an important decision to fulfill\nthis demand. We will shortly introduce a Bill for the formation of\nUttarakhand state.\n      As per the provisions of the Constitution this Bill would be placed\nbefore the State Legislature after the ensuing Vidhan Sabha Elections in\nU.P. for their views. Later this Bill would be placed before the Parliament so\nthat the State of Uttarakhand could be formed soon.\n     We believe that this decision of the Government will fulfil the hopes\nand aspirations of the people of Uttarakhand.\n     In today's world, there is no substitute for higher economic growth.\nThe strength and stability of a nation depends upon the growth of its\neconomy.\n       This is also essential for achieving our cherishment goals of\nself-reliance, modernisation and the eradication of poverty. We should\nlearn to use the opportunities thrown up by the international, technological\nand financial developments.\n     Our task now is to release the creative energies to the people by\nshedding outdated controls and regulations.\n     Focus upon the well-being of the poor is an essential part of our\neconomic philosophy. It is necessary to ensure that the fruits of growth\nreach the poor and the inequalities in incomes and opportunities are\nnarrowed.\n     While promoting industrial growth, we cannot neglect Agriculture.\nWithout high agricultural development, it will not be possible for us to\nachieve either rapid economic growth or the removal of poverty.\n     High economic growth can be achieved not by shout slogans but by\ndetermined efforts to provide more watt electricity, roads, new\ntechnologies, fertilizers and adequate credit.\n        We have already initiated steps to increase investment in agriculture.\nThe prices of phosphate and potassic fertilizers have been brought down\nconsiderably by increasing the quantum of concession given on these\nfertilizers. This will increase the output of our farmers and lead to their\neconomic betterment.\n      Farmers need more water for their lands. We will involve a National\nPolicy on water sharing and, water management.\n      There are several issues relating to sharing and use of water and\nresettlement of people affected by irrigation projects. These issues need to\nbe resolved through negotiations in the best interests of the nation.\n      The recent Agreement reached by Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh,\nMaharashtra and Rajasthan on the Sardar Sarovar Project shows how\nsuch issues can be resolved through discussions.\n      I am concerned that we have not been able to provide basic minimum\nservices to our people, especially the poor living in the rural and urban\nareas even after so many years of independence.\n     The faith and the confidence of our people in the ability of the\nGovernment, will ultimately depend on our providing these services to\nevery citizen.\n       I had convened a Conference of Chief Ministers in Delhi last month in\nwhich it was decided that there should provisions of Safe Drinking Water\nfor all in rural and urban areas; Primary Health Care facilities for all\nUniversity and Primary Education; Housing Assistance for all poor families\nwithout shelter and more all weather roads for villages.\n       There should be provision for Mid-day Meals in Primary Schools in\nthe villages and urban slums.\n      The Conference decided to draw up programmes to achieve concrete\nresults by the year 2000.\n     More money will be spent on Basic Minimum services and\ndevelopment of drought and desert and for the welfare of Scheduled\nCastes, Scheduled Tribes and Minorities.\n      The people living in urban slums have not received adequate support\nin the past for their housing civic amenities. We are making a provision of\nRs. 250 this year for this purpose.\n     There will be greater involvement of the State implementation of\nthese programmes.\n     We will enhance the provision for rural development.\n     The jurisdiction of Panchayati Raj provision has been extended and\nmore powers have been given to them.\n     Our economy provides ample new opportunities for productive work,\nespecially in self-employment. The educated youth from poor families can\nbenefit immensely from these opportunities.\n     At present there are several schemes for self-employment. We\npropose to introduce a unified self-employment programme for educated\nunemployed youth in rural and urban areas to benefit 10 lakh youths in\n1996-97.\n      They will be provided training facilities and enhanced subsidy and\ncredit support. This step would benefit our youth in large numbers\nirrespective of caste, religion or any other differentiation.\n    I am particularly concerned about the artisans, craftspersons,\nweavers and fishermen, who should also benefit from new opportunities.\n     At present, there is a scheme to provide a minimum of 100 days\nemployment in a year to anyone seeking work from poor households. This\nscheme is operating in only 5 out of every 10 blocks in the country.\n      Our Government will extend the scheme to cover all blocks within the\nnext two years.\n        The functioning of the Public Distribution Systems has been widely\ncriticised. It has failed to serve the people of several States. We have now\ndecided to extend, in a manner, the Public Distribution System to provide\nup to 20 kilograms of rice and wheat every month to the poor families on\nhalf the normal price.\n     The scheme will come into operation from \"Gandhi Jayanti” 2nd\nOctober, 1996 and when fully implemented 34 crore poor people will be\nbenefited.\n     Our Government symbolizes the empowerment of the downtrodden,\nthe Scheduled Castes, the Scheduled Tribes and the backward classes.\nWe want to enhance their dignity and self-confidence.\n     The Central and State Governments will have to take steps for\nbringing economic freedom, education and more opportunities for them.\n     Most people belonging to these groups are even landless or small\nfarmers. Their land is unproductive because of the lack of land\ndevelopment and irrigation. This had to attended to.\n        We have decided to introduce a “Ganga Kalyan\" Scheme for\nproviding assistance to poor cultivators belonging to scheduled castes and\nscheduled tribes and other backward classes. They will be given upto Rs.\n50,000 per hectare for land development, horticulture and irrigation\nfacilities.\n       One of the most vulnerable sections of the society continue to be\nwomen, who constitute nearly half of our population. We should not neglect\ntheir right to get their due share in the Governance of the country. We have\nalready announced our plan to reserve one third of the seats in State\nlegislature and the Parliament for women. A similar initiative to reserve one\nthird of the posts for women in Government is also under consideration.\n     Although a comprehensive law has been passed by Parliament,\nopportunities for persons with disabilities, are not uniform. We are\ncommitted to effective implementation of the Law for the Protection of\nRights of the Disabled in consultation with the State Governments.\n       In each State there is need for an apex institution for training and\nbasic rehabilitation services. Similarly, in every district, a centre for\nrehabilitation of the people affected by various disabilities, and vocational\ntraining facilities is needed.\n      We shall take steps to ensure that reservations in employment for\ndisabled persons are uniformly implemented and welfare measures aimed\nat them are improved.\n     Groups of disabled persons living in the villages will be organised into\n“Sangams” and a sum of Rs. 15,000 will be made available to each such\n“Sangam\" for suitable economic activities.\n     We have the distinction of being the biggest democracy in the world.\nWe are proud of it.\n     Many of the gains of development are offset due to unchecked\ngrowth in our population. Some States like Haryana and Punjab have\nachieved commendable results in reducing population growth.\n      It is important that in all other States people and the Government\nwork together to achieve tangible results in promoting the small family norm\nso that the gains of development reach everybody.\n      On this occasion, I salute our Armed Forces, who are bravely\nperforming their duty in different parts of our country, many times under\nconditions of extreme hardship. We are proud of their achievements and\ndedication to service.\n      We will maintain the morale, equipment and readiness of our security\nforces at the highest level.\n      We take this opportunity to pay tribute to our Defence services and\nsecurity forces for the sacrifices they have made for the country.\n      We have to take note of the induction of the new sophisticated arms\nin our vicinity.\n     I want to assure the country that meeting of the security needs is a\nmatter of priority for us.\n       We shall not compromise on issues of defence and nation security.\n       Our indigenous capability will be enhanced and strengthened in every\nway.\n      We have made progress in building our own tanks, our own combat\naircrafts and developing our missiles like Agni and Prithvi. All these\nprogrammes will be continued within the framework already established.\n      A word about the good work done by our scientists: not only have\nthey contributed to our defence capability, but also to our civilian\nprogrammes.\n     Space research is an area where we can be justly proud of what we\nhave achieved. In March this year we achieved the second successful\nlaunch of our Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle which placed a remote-sensing\nsatellite in the space. We are among a handful countries in the world that\nhave this capability.\n      Our foreign policy is dedicated by our national interests. These are\nwide-ranging and include establishing our ability to influence the external\nenvironment.\n      Our priority is to evolve better relations with our neighbours.\n       We seek actively to promote cooperation both bilaterally and within\nthe framework of the South Asian Association of Regional Cooperation.\n      We are willing to settle all outstanding issues through dialogue and\ncall upon our neighbours to response positively.\n      We are active members of the United Nations. We have made signal\ncontributions to the Peace-keeping operation of the UN and have\nvigorously promoted the social and economic agenda of the UN.\n    We believe we have a legitimate claim to serve as a permanent\nmember of the expanded Security Council.\n     The Security Council should truly reflect the expanded membership of\nthe UN and developing countries must be included as permanent\nmembers.\n    Global security today demands a universal appraisal to disarmament.\nWe have concluded treaties for the elimination of chemical and biological\nweapons.\n      It is now necessary to tackle nuclear weapons, and last remaining\ncategory of weapons of mass destruction. Visualised the Comprehensive\nTest Ban Treaty as apart process of global nuclear disarmament, leading to\nthe complete elimination of all nuclear weapons, within reasonable time\nhorizon. This, the nuclear weapon States are unwilling to accept and are\nseeking to perpetuate their monopoly on nuclear weapons. We cannot\nagree to this.\n     We have also to take note of the open as well as clandestine nuclear\nprogrammes in our immediate neighbourhood. Therefore, we have made it\nclear that India will oppose a Test-ban Treaty that imposes unacceptable\nconditions on us. The country is behind us in our stand and we will not\ncompromise in matter of national security.\n     Countrymen, we are today entering the 50th Year of our\nIndependence. The time has come for all of us to take stock of our\nsuccesses and failures.\n      The achievements since Independence - and there are many and\nthey should encourage and inspire us to do more to take the nation\nforward.\n     The mistakes committed in the past should make us ask where we\nwent wrong. The successes should not go to our head because a lot\nremains to be accomplished. The mistakes and failures should not\ndiscourage us and push us into a state of inertia.\n       The world is changing fast and is not going to wait for us to catch up.\nWe have to shed our complacency and move ahead so that India can find\nits rightful place in the world.\n     This is a crucial moment in our history. The nation is poised to\nemerge as a strong economic power in the next few years.\n      The people have to remain alert and protect the honour and dignity of\nthe nation. Our forefathers have told the Mantra of self-reliance. We have\nlearnt to depend essentially on our own resources. There are external\npressures and internal problems. If the Situation warrants then the country\nshould stand up as one to face any such crisis.\n      A century of freedom struggle and the experiences since\nIndependence have given us the confidence that a bright and prosperous\nfuture can be built.\n      Our biggest asset are the people - 95 core of them whether they are\nworking in fields producing foodgrains, as skilled workers in industrial\nplants, or scientist in laboratories, or jawans guarding our frontiers, or the\nyouth they are all contributing to the collective effort to build a strong India.\n      When a great nation wakes up and begins to move ahead nothing\ncan stop it in its tracks.\n    We are drawing close to the end of an even a century which saw the\nawakening of the nation. We now prepare ourselves for the 21st century.\n      It is the duty of the Government, every political party, the intelligentsia\nand all citizens of the land to seize this great moment and build a new\nIndia. I have great faith in the people of India. We should all look to the\nfuture with hope, courage and self-confidence.\n      On this historic day, I appeal to all countrymen to resolve to work for\nan India where every citizen - irrespective of caste, creed and religion - can\nhold his or her head high.\n      I now invite you to join in raising the national slogan with me: Jai\nHind, Jai Hind, Jai Hind."},{"year":1995,"pm":"P.V.

I offer my best wishes for the betterment of our country\nand the world as a whole. May you all live happily and the country move\nahead on the path of progress.\n      You are aware of the tremendous changes taking place the world\nover in recent years, the maps of several countries have been redrawn.\nSuch has been the magnitude of the changes in these countries that we\ncannot even recognise the picture which has now emerged. We are also\ntrying to keep pace with this changing world. At the same time we do not\nwant and, in fact, we cannot give up our intrinsic values. As Mahatma\nGandhi said, freedom does not mean mere change of masters; the\nessence of freedom lies in changing the lot of Daridranarayan — our poor\nbrethren. I would like to assure you that we have been following and will\ncontinue to follow the same mission. This is the policy of the Government.\n      This Government has been in office for a little more than three years.\nMany things have happened during these years and I have been informing\nyou about them from time to time. The overall picture that emerges will\nmake it clear that during these three years considerable progress has been\nmade. On the whole, peace and harmony prevails in the country and\npeople are busy in their work — in the task of development and country's\nprogress. We have made and are making sincere efforts to solve the\nproblems. Nor will there be any slackening of such efforts in future.\n       Punjab is peaceful. The State continues to hold the first position in\nthe field of foodgrains production and in many other fields of development.\nThe problem of Assam has been resolved. There was some problem\nregarding Bodoland but that too is being tackled. Some agitations and\ndisturbances are taking place there, but that should not cause undue worry.\n     In our North-Eastern States there are occasional disturbances.\nSometimes our tribal brothers inhabiting that region clash with one another.\nBut on the whole, the situation is fully under control.\n      Now, let me speak about Kashmir which, for some time has been a\nproblem for us. Though there has been considerable improvement in the\nsituation, it has not reached the level of normalcy as yet. The reason is not\nvery far to seek. Everybody knows, how Pakistan has been actively\nencouraging terrorism in the State from across the border, how it has been\ntraining the terrorists on its land and giving them financial help, how it has\nbeen arming and then sending them across the border into the State. There\nis no doubt about this. For so many years, we have been collecting\nevidence of the misdeeds of Pakistan, bringing that to the notice of the\ncountries friendly to us and telling them what Pakistan has been doing all\nthese years. Now, after 14th August, 1994, I think no further proof is\nrequired when they have themselves openly declared that they would\ncontinue their help to the terrorists in Kashmir, give them arms and send\nreinforcements. They have said that this would continue forever.\n       I would like to ask these friendly countries, “Respected friends, what\ndo you say now? Till yesterday, you believed us only partially. Sometimes\nyou would tell us that perhaps Pakistan had earlier been doing it but not\nnow?\" Only recently, I had had occasions to listen to this kind of talk in\nsome of the countries I visited. Now I want to ask them if they still have any\ndoubt about it. So it is very obvious that Pakistan does not want to stop\nthese activities. Instead, it has openly announced before the world that it\nwould continue with them. Our reply can only be that we are also not going\nto sit back until we have completely rooted out this blatant interference in\nour internal affairs. It is our resolve and we want to make this clear to them.\n      Meanwhile, we have taken several steps in Kashmir to bring peace to\nthe State and to identify the terrorists. I say “terrorists', for no other word\ncan befit them. They have been mercilessly killing people, especially\nopinion leaders of the State -- lawyers, doctors and religious leaders.\nRecently they also killed the Assembly Speaker. Their victims include staff\nof media installations, like All India Radio and Doordarshan. They killed the\nVice-Chancellor of a university. They have been killing government\nservants who are simply performing their duties and who have nothing to\ndo with politics. And there is no count of innocent civilians being killed by\nthem. How would you describe these heinous acts? What else is it, if not\nterrorism? I have no other word to describe this. But you can rest assured\nthat we will completely wipe out terrorism.\n       Recently, we have taken several initiatives in J & K for accelerating\nthe pace of development and boosting the morale of the civil administration\nterrorised by guns. I may tell you that we are going to take up the revision\nof electoral rolls shortly. We are also engaged in delimiting the\nconstituencies for conducting elections. This clearly shows the direction in\nwhich we are moving. We are moving towards holding elections in the\nState. I don't want to give you any specific date because that might unduly\nprovoke the terrorists to indulge in more violence. But there is no doubt\nabout the direction in which we are moving. Now when we have been doing\nall this, we would expect the international community to take note of it and\nto see who is the one actually trampling the human rights. They will have\nan opportunity to judge this.\n        It is very unfortunate that not only something bad is done but it is\nopenly declared that what they are doing is good and that they will continue\nto do the same in future also. This type of language does not behove\nfriends. I want to appeal to Pakistan, please accept the hand of friendship\nwe have extended. There can be several meeting grounds between us.\nSometimes differences may crop up, but they can be resolved. I would\nhowever, like to make it clear to Pakistan, you may or may not cooperate\nwith us, but, 'with you, without you, in spite of you’ Kashmir will remain with\nus. It is an integral part of India. This will not change, never, not in the least.\nThey say they are a nation of twelve crores. If they talk of crores, you can\nunderstand what my answer would be. However, it is not a question of\ncrores; it is a question of justice, it is a question of law and the Constitution.\nYou cannot negate all this and reverse the course of history. The sooner\nwe all realise this, the better it is for us. This is what I want to convey.\n      Let us now look at our economic scenario. I have been telling you\nfrom time to time about the progress we have made during the three years.\nToday the situation in our country is not as it was in 1991. It has improved a\nlot. We have foreign exchange reserves worth Rs. 51,000 crore. Just\nimagine, in 1991, we had foreign exchange worth only Rs. 3,000 crore. It is\nno mean achievement. You can imagine to what extent the\ncreditworthiness of our country has gone up. Not only this, we have even\nrepaid the IMF loan well in advance, so that we may be spared of interest\nliabilities to that extent. We told our creditors that we have the money now\nand we want to repay, which you should accept. We would borrow when\nwe are in need. Has it ever happened before? This has happened in a very\nfew countries. In India also, when Indiraji was the Prime Minister, it\nhappened once and after that this has happened a second time, that is this\nyear.\n       I want to tell you that this is ample proof of our creditworthiness, our\nsolvency: As a result of the confidence that world has come to have in\nIndia, investments are flowing into our country from abroad. Large\nindustries are being set up. Only a few days back, we have cleared a\nforeign project for power in Maharashtra worth about Rs. 8000 crore. I\nwould like to have another ten or twelve such projects to come to our\ncountry so that the resources available with us are spared. If such projects\nhad not come, and we had not got funds in the country, the Government\nwould have been obliged to raise the money by taxing you, because we\ncannot do without electricity. The amount we have saved now, will be spent\nfor the poor, for the children, for the repair of schools, for the programmes\nrelating to education, health and other facilities. I have been emphasising\nthis time and again. Today I am placing before you a concrete example.\n       A beginning has been made and more projects of similar nature are\ncoming in because people abroad have come to have confidence in India,\nin its stability, in its economy, in its law and order situation, and they are\nconvinced that there is no risk of losing their money invested here. Instead,\nthey would earn profits. Whilst they earn profits, we are also benefited.\nPeople get jobs; our engineers, doctors and thousands of educated\npersons get employment. Therefore, we would like this process to continue.\nOurs is a big country. Just one project will not make any impact. If a project\ncomes up in Maharashtra, people in Assam do not think much of it. So it\nhas to come in Assam as well. It has to be in Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra,\nDelhi, Uttar Pradesh and other regions. In fact, when such big projects\ncome up in all the States, then only it will have an impact and we shall\nrealise what industrialisation means in the real sense of the term.\n       The investments coming from abroad are not going to deprive us of\nour freedom. Indian company and Indian partners are investing in such\nprojects along with foreigners. That means our people have a share in\nthem. About 80 per cent of the foreign investments are joint ventures.\nTherefore, it is entirely fallacious to say that we would be swallowed up.\nThese projects have investments both from Indians and foreigners. Nobody\nwill shift them anywhere else. If the projects come here they will not be\ncompromised in any way. And we really need these projects and\ninvestments in the power sector, in oil industry, in metallurgical industry,\nwhich are most essential. They are coming in electronics, chemicals and\nother areas of our priority.\n      Now I come to agriculture. God has been kind to us. We have had\ngood rains and consequently good harvests for the last three-four years.\nOur farmers have created a miracle. No other country has, perhaps,\nwitnessed a revolution of this kind.\n       But we are faced with a problem now. You may not perhaps believe\nit, but it is a fact that when the Kharif crop is harvested in a couple of\nweeks, we shall have no space to store the paddy. I had said this earlier\nalso. Today I have got the statistics. You may not perhaps be aware that as\non date we have 3.25 crore tonnes of foodgrains in our stock. We do not\nhave enough storage facilities. So, the foodgrains from the new harvest will\nhave to be kept in the open. It may result in some loss, but we are helpless.\nI would like to utilise foodgrains for our children and students who live in\nhostels. I have to see that at least 10 to 15 lakh tonnes are out of the\ngodowns for use, so that we have space to store the foodgrains from the\nnew crop. Old stocks are in quite good condition and we want to use them.\nAs of now, there seems to be no chance for exporting them. So we would\nlike to use them for our own people. We want to give some wheat to\nModern Food Industries. They have assured us that if we give them wheat,\na rupee cheaper, they will proportionately reduce the price of bread they\nmanufacture out of it. We want to give them the surplus wheat so that the\nprice of bread comes down.\n      We have our Integrated Child Development Scheme. The Anganwadi\nProgramme for villages has not yet reached all of them. We propose to\nspread it throughout the length and breadth of the country in a couple of\nyears. In order to enhance the nutritive value of the food served to these\nchildren, we would like to give some more wheat out of our stocks. We\nhave in our country thousands of hostels in which mostly students from the\npoorer sections, including those belonging to Scheduled Castes,\nScheduled Tribes and Backward Classes, reside. They have no means to\navail of the facilities of private hostels, so they live in government hostels.\nSome States have large numbers of such hostels, in which thousands of\nstudents live. We would like to provide them more nutritious food and we\nshall do so out of the surplus stocks with us. In this way, we may be able to\ndispose of 10 to 15 lakh tonnes of stock which will, at the same time,\nbenefit the students and the tiny tots covered by the Integrated Child\nDevelopment Scheme.\n       We are chalking out this programme, the implementation of which will\nstart in a few days. We are trying to solve our problems in this way — not\nby exporting our foodgrains but by providing more nutrition to our own\npeople.\n      As you know, we have started the revamped Public Distribution\nSystem (PDS) in about 1800 blocks two years back. This scheme has been\noperating quite well. We would like to provide more foodgrains through the\nPDS at cheaper prices and overcome the shortcomings which has been\nthere in this system. Towards this end we have constructed several\ngodowns, provided a number of vehicles to the State governments to carry\nfoodgrains to the remote areas. It is a gigantic programme. There is no time\nto go into details, but I may say that a programme of such dimension has\nnot perhaps been undertaken earlier. And we propose to expand it further\nby covering more blocks. We would like to cover about 200 more blocks\nand eventually spread the programme all over the country.\n       You are aware of the huge amount we have provided for rural\ndevelopment. You must have heard many times that we have allocated Rs.\n30,000 crore in this Five Year Plan and more than Rs. 7000 crore is being\ngiven in one year. People come to me from villages and tell me that they\nhave never seen so much money coming to their villages from Delhi.\nPresently as much as Rs. 40 to 50 crore are at the disposal of each of the\nDistrict Collectors. It is being used for public works. We feel that a\nrevolution is under way, in fact it is taking place there, in every village. Now\nPanchayats are being set up in villages under a new law and much of this\nmoney will go to them. They would take up the implementation of\ndevelopment works and schemes for the welfare of the people according to\ntheir priorities.\n       I may assure you that now paucity of funds would not be felt that\nmuch. But now the local people, local leadership of the Panchayats will\nhave to supervise how the money is spent. Nobody from here would\nsupervise that. At times people from here may go but that would not help. It\nis the local people who will have to oversee how the money is being used.\nLater on, nobody should complain that the money was not spent properly.\nTherefore, I want to warn you in advance that people in all the villages and\nthe youth should be on their alert in this regard. This programme will run\nvery smoothly, if Sarpanchs and other members of Panchayats discharge\ntheir responsibilities properly. We intend to provide more money for this in\nthe next Five Year Plan.\n      I had announced three new schemes last year from these ramparts.\nAs you know, we have been continuing several schemes which were\nstarted by Rajivji—Jawahar Rozgar Yojana, Nehru Rozgar Yojana, Indira\nAwas Yojana. Several schemes of this type started by him continue to be\nimplemented with full vigour. Simultaneously, I had announced three new\nschemes last year and these schemes are also progressing very well. One\nof the three schemes is ‘Mahila Samriddhi Yojana' which is for our sisters.\nYou will be surprised to know that within a year, rather within 8-9 months,\n13 lakh women, 13 lakh of our sisters, have opened their own accounts in\npost offices. You may say 13 lakh is not a big number where crores live.\nBut you should try to appreciate the significance of 13 lakh women going to\nthe post offices on their own and opening their accounts within 8 months in\ntheir own name. It means that they have liked this scheme a lot and they\nare very enthusiastic about it. I may add here that out of these 13 lakh\nwomen, at least 2 lakh belong to Scheduled Tribe areas which shows how\nfar this awakening has reached and how far it is about to reach.\n       Some of the States have done very well in this regard, though some\nothers have done very little work under this scheme. Rather, I should say,\nsome have not yet started on this. I would like to appeal to the Chief\nMinisters of these States that we have had enough of quibbles and\nquarrels. This programme is above party politics where there is no room for\nrivalry. This is for the common good of the people, for the good of the\nwomen. I would appeal them to go ahead, and implement the scheme by\nasking their people, their party, their followers, their youth that when other\nStates have been working on this, why should it not be implemented in\nours.\n       Another programme is for rural employment. You know, people in\ntheir own villages do not have work for all the 365 days. Our programme is\nto provide them employment at least for 100 days in a year. It is being\nimplemented very well. According to reports we are receiving, things have\nimproved a lot. Wherever this programme has been launched, people have\nstopped migrating to the cities during the lean period because we have\nstarted many types of work-like construction of roads, small tanks, school\nbuildings. On the one hand people and the villages are being benefited by\nthese construction works and on the other hand a lot of employment\nopportunities are being generated.\n      The third programme is for the youth — the urban youth, who have\nstudied only up to 8th standard, 9th standard or matric. The programme is\nto provide a loan of one lakh of rupees to each such young person. This\namount contains a subsidy of Rs. 7,500. The youths are to be trained for\nrunning small business ventures like bicycle repair workshop, shops and\nthe like. Last year, we set a target to give assistance to 40,000 youths. I am\nhappy that about 32,000 or 33,000 youths have received the amount and\ntraining under the programme and are now engaged in their work.\n      This year we want to increase the number of beneficiaries to two\nlakhs. Funds have been arranged for this. Once again I would like to\nrequest the States which have not taken up the programme, to take it up\nand implement. I would not like to name such States in public as it is not\ndone. The States which have taken up the programme have done very well\nand I congratulate them. At the same time I appeal to the Chief Ministers of\nthe States where it has not been taken up to implement the programme.\nFunds are there, provision has already been made, and only attention is\nneeded to make the programme work.\n       The three programmes are making good progress. We thought about\nsome other programmes, which could be implemented by us. I feel that\nthere are certain programmes, which can be undertaken. A programme for\nchildren could not be taken up last year. Now we want to include it. You\nknow that there are around 20 million children in our country who should be\nattending schools but are not doing so. They are working in factories to\nincrease the income of their parents. Working in the factories means end of\ntheir education and the children's development forever. It is a fact which we\nhave to accept. This is unfortunate for our coming generations. We have,\ntherefore, said that the young children working in occupations such as quilt\nmaking, carpet weaving, which are very hazardous, and tell adversely upon\ntheir health should be withdrawn from there and enrolled in schools. They\nhave to be educated, they have to be trained in various crafts and such\nvocations which may enable them to earn their livelihood later. We are\ntaking up this programme. There are about 20 lakh children engaged in\nsuch hazardous vocations, that tell upon their health adversely. We want to\nwithdraw them from such industries and put in schools in the course of next\nfour-five years.\n       The only way to achieve this aim is to provide the parents of such\nchildren full employment to increase their incomes because the parents are\nso poor that they cannot sustain themselves without additional income\nearned by the children. If such parents are provided full employment and\ntheir income is raised, there is no reason why they should not be sending\ntheir children to school willingly. But they are helpless and we are trying to\nrid them of their helplessness. The new programme aims at improving the\nprospects of the children whose life may be ruined because of their early\nemployment in hazardous industries. The programme announced today will\nbe implemented shortly. All the arrangements have been made.\n       I want to talk about another programme. In bigger cities there are\nmunicipal corporations. They get funds and also have other sources of\nincome. So far as villages are concerned, we have already made adequate\nprovisions. But there are smaller towns with a population ranging from\n50,000 to 150,000. They are neither cities nor villages. They are beset by\nthe ills of both. There is no agency to look after the well-being of these\ntowns. Since they do not have enough income to provide civic amenities,\ntheir condition is becoming worse. People migrate from villages and settle\ndown, and slums grow leading to unhygienic conditions affecting the health\nof the people. We want to take up 300 such towns with a population upto\none lakh and we propose to spend Rs. 800 crore for their betterment on a\npriority basis in the next five years. The scheme has been drawn up and I\nhave studied it yesterday. I found that it has been well prepared. Now we\nare in a position to take up its implementation.\n      Now I would like to take up 2-3 other important issues. We have\nundertaken quietly a number of programmes for minorities. These\nprogrammes have not been advertised but I would like to tell about them.\nThe Rapid Action Force (RAF) was raised for the protection of life and\nproperty of the people. Last year I announced that five RAF battalions\nwould be raised. But we have doubled the strength by raising 10 battalions.\nThese have been located at places such as : Hyderabad, Ahmedabad,\nAllahabad, Belgaum, Delhi, Aligarh, Thiruvananthapuram, Jamshedpur,\nBhopal and Meerut. In this Force, women are also included because\nsometimes we need their help to control the situation. God forbid, we may\nnot need more of them because if people live in peace and harmony we do\nnot need such forces. But still we will be on our guard and if need arises we\nwill try to increase the number of these battalions. We will not hesitate to do\nso. The members of this Force are trained in a special way, a lot of thinking\ngoes in their selection and they are always ready for every kind of duty.\nWhenever there is a riot or disturbance, they immediately reach the scene\nof occurrence and control the situation. They are specially trained for this\nkind of job and I feel that because of them several riots can be controlled\nand will be controlled before they do any serious damage. This Force will\ncontinue to do its work and its capacity can be increased in the future.\n      Many a time I have referred to the Minorities Commission. You know\nthat a law has been enacted in this regard. We are fully conscious of the\neducational foundation in the name of Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, and as\nyou know there are several similar institutions which especially take care of\nthe education of the minorities. I would not go into details because they\nhave already been mentioned.\n      Today, I want to draw your attention to another ambitious\nprogramme. We wanted to set up a corporation which would help members\nof the minorities in setting up their own enterprises and in getting proper\neducation. I had made an announcement about this last year. There were\nsome legal hurdles and I am very glad to announce that with a lot of efforts,\nwe have been able to remove them and now the “National Minorities\nFinance and Development Corporation” will come into being with an\nauthorised capital of Rs. 500 crore. The Union Cabinet has already cleared\nit and this would take shape in the coming few days. When this Corporation\nstarts working, I would like the lakhs of youth belonging to the minority\ncommunities to take full advantage of this. This was a promise made by me\nlast year and I was a little worried about the delay in setting it up. I myself\nwent into all the details and strived to remove all the hurdles. I am glad that\nwe succeeded in our efforts.\n      I shall give you another very good news. From today, you can watch\nTV telecast in eleven languages. I recall that I had made an announcement\nregarding telecast in five languages last year. Today, I am announcing that\nprogrammes will be telecast in 11 languages and you need not keep eleven\nantennas for this facility. Now while sitting in Delhi, you can watch\nprogrammes of Calcutta, Madras, Hyderabad, Bombay etc. It is a big\nachievement and I presume that in the next few months we will be able to\ntelecast the programmes in 13 languages, instead of 11 and you will be\nable to watch the programmes of all the languages, wherever they are\nbeing telecast, on your TV sets through a dish antenna. I am, really, very\nhappy to announce this.\n      I had addressed our jawans on matters of defence and security last\nevening. They will get all the encouragement and support from us. We shall\nprovide them any kind of arms they would require — most modern or\notherwise. They should not have any apprehension on this. Our soldiers\nare doing their duty on borders and assisting the people in different parts of\nthe country. Not only this, they are working in some foreign countries also\nand they have made India proud. They have made a place for themselves\nin the hearts of the people of Cambodia, Somalia or wherever we have sent\nthem. I congratulate them once again and assure them that they will not\nfind us wanting in our efforts to fulfil their requirements. A good force is\nalways armed with the most modern weapons so that it goes to war without\nany apprehension and with full confidence. While congratulating our forces,\nI want to assure our forces that we have already tried to improve the terms\nand conditions of their service and hope that the new Pay Commission will\ngo further into this matter. But I would like to add here that there is no way\nwe can measure and fully compensate the sentinels of our freedom as their\nservice is an act of patriotism. I would like to greet and congratulate them\nonce again.\n      Now I will come to matters relating to our Foreign Policy Today, India\nis maintaining friendly relations with all the countries of the world. I have\nundertaken visits to several countries like the USA, Russia, China,\nEngland, Germany, France, Iran, Korea Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Mauritius,\nIndonesia, Oman and others. They have high regards for India. Bilateral\ncooperation is increasing, cooperation in the economic field is increasing\nvery rapidly. In terms of foreign investment, which is another form of such\ncooperation, the amounts we have received during the last three years is\nalmost twice the investment we had got during the previous ten years. I am\nnot saying this just for the sake of comparison but the facts speak. L am\nsure this is going to take place on a larger scale in future. I am going to\nSingapore, Vietnam and Malaysia. We have very cordial relations with all\nthe countries. I have also told you that we have cordial relations with all our\nneighbours. I will once again ask our friends in Pakistan that they should\naccept our hand of friendship, and not spurn it. After all we have to coexist,\nwe have to live as neighbours. We cannot move away from our neighbours.\nPakistan will remain where it is, and we will remain here where we are.\n        There is a big hue and cry about our missiles and missile programme\nand a lot of propaganda is going on. It is very strange that though Pakistan\nhas with it readymade bought off the shelf missiles, nobody talks about\nthem. We only want to experiment in our laboratories, and conduct some\ntests and that causes a lot of hue and cry. What kind of justice is this, we\nfail to understand. We have not increased our expenditure on defence.\nIndia is not a small country. Do I have no right, is it not my duty to mobilise\nresources for the defence requirements of a country so vast, with such vast\nborders and coastlines? Let anybody say anything, I shall mobilise the\nresources. Our first priority is the security of the country. There is no scope\nfor any compromise, any reduction in it. That is why, I want to tell my\nfriends that they should not compare India with other countries. They\nshould see the case of India according to its requirements, whether we\nhave spent the same amount as countries of our size are spending. We are\nspending less than that. To compare our defence expenditure with a small\ncountry and to say that we should not spend this much is not just. All that is\nrequired to be done for our defence will be done. Let there be no doubt in\nthat regard.\n       I want to tell you that the whole world is changing but there are some\nplaces where things do not change. Some people cannot change their\nmind-set. Today, I am ready to set aside politics and prepared to go\nbeyond mere political and diplomatic relations. At present, we are\nexpanding economic relations with all. Why shouldn't we expand these\neconomic relations within the SAARC? Why does Pakistan feel so bad\nabout it? Why is it so much hesitant? Let us cooperate in our SAARC\nnetwork of seven nations. But even this is not acceptable to them.\nWherever our Pakistani friends go, they raise the Kashmir issue. I have\nstopped talking about Kashmir in any forum, nor do I give any reply to any\nquestion on the issue. It is not necessary for us to tread the same path they\nare walking upon. It is not necessary for us to reply to all the questions they\nraise. The world knows what they have to say and what we have to reply.\nPeople are aware of the conditions at the field level. Nothing is hidden from\nanybody. Only they go on unnecessarily repeating them. I understand,\nPakistan is going to raise the Kashmir issue in a conference of the Health\nMinisters. Now raising the issue in season and out of it will attract only the\nderision of the world. We want to tell our friends that we share a blood\nrelationship. For God's sake, please for the sake of our relationship, do not\ndo this. We can solve these problems across the table. They talk of an\nunfinished task. What is this unfinished task? In my well-considered\nopinion, there is only one unfinished task from our point of view and that is\nthe restoration of Pak-occupied part of Kashmir to India. This is the only\nunfinished task, nothing else remains.\n      If this is not acceptable to you, the Simla Agreement is there. Let us\nextend our hands of friendship to each other and move ahead shoulder to\nshoulder. Please do not spurn these possibilities and stand in the way of a\nbright future that looks ahead. But it is your sweet will if you are not\nprepared to meet half way, we are firm on our own position. I want to tell\nyou that Kashmir is an integral part of India and will ever remain so. I am\nnot using the language of threat. Whatever I am saying, I am doing, is with\na cool head, and with a full sense of responsibility. If language is not to\nchange, let there be a change in intentions. Sometimes, one is obliged to\nuse such language. If one does not do so, people around get angry with\nthat person. I know this sort of compulsions exist at times. We do not have\nany such constraint. It may, however exist for some people in some\ncountries. Still at least their intentions can be positive and peaceful. We\nwant peace but at the same time, we want to preserve our sovereignty.\nThere can be no compromise on these two issues.\n      One thing more. Our freedom struggle had a very long run. It was so\nbecause it was based on non-violence. It did not come to an end in a few\nmonths, rather it continued for years and decades. During the course,\nmany great personalities took part in the struggle. Many of them did not live\nto see freedom.\n        But there were others who could see independent India, to which they\nmade great contribution during and after the freedom struggle. They are all\nvenerable souls for us. After independence, they had some differences\namongst them, and they parted company, they went to form many political\nparties. But this does happen in a democracy. All the same, we bow to their\nsense of patriotism, to the role they played in the freedom struggle. We\nrespect and revere them. On this issue, there is no question of party\naffiliation or party politics. It is coincidence that this year we are also\ncelebrating the 125th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. We have\nchalked out an ambitious programme. The programme is based on the path\nshown by Gandhiji for the common good of the people. Besides, Acharya\nVinoba Bhave's birth centenary falls during the next month, that is\nSeptember. We also propose to celebrate it on a large scale. Acharya\nVinoba Bhave was among those who tried to bring about a revolution by\nfollowing the path shown by Gandhiji. We still remember him. If we had\neven one hundredth part of the scholarship, originality of thought and the\nwill to act up to it that he was endowed with, it would have done\ntremendous good to the country. We would naturally like to celebrate his\nbirth centenary. Then, the birth centenary of Rafi Ahmed Kidwai is being\ncelebrated. A Committee on this has been formed which has its own\nprogrammes. We are going to act on those programmes in a befitting way\nso that our youth may be made aware of such exemplary personalities.\n       There is also a Memorial Committee for Lok Nayak Jayaprakash\nNarayan. It is working for many years now but we want to give a new\ncontent to its programmes and intensify them. He had, in his own way,\nshown a path to the country. There is no doubt that there can be many\nroads which lead to the same destination. He had also shown us a path, a\npath of total revolution. I have studied it, so also thousands of youths of this\ncountry and others. His was not an ordinary personality but a great one.\nAnd we want to pay our tributes to him and give further impetus to his\nprogrammes. Shri Morarji Desai will be one hundred years old in coming\nFebruary. Now he is 99. He is also a great patriot. He has sacrificed a lot\nand later became the Prime Minister of the country. But let us not look into\nthe status he held. Let us look at the personality. One will rarely come\nacross such a unique personality. We would like to celebrate his centenary\nnext year. Like this, we would like to celebrate quite a few birth centenaries\nbecause we had many great leaders in this country. There might be\ndifferences of opinion among them in ideologies, in their approaches and\nother spheres. But they all deserve our respect. We want to celebrate birth\ncentenaries of all these great persons so that people will understand these\ngreat personalities, who were the driving force in achieving freedom and\nwho showed what sacrifices are required to strengthen and safeguard it.\nPeople must know about them and learn from their lives.\n       I have taken a lot of your time but I would like to tell you that quite a\nfew things have been left out. In 45 minutes or one hour, everything cannot\nbe covered. Whenever opportunity comes, I would present before you other\nprogrammes. There are many programmes which call for a detailed\ndescription but because of time constraint, I am not able to touch upon\nthem. I would, however, like to tell you that the country is marching ahead\non the road to progress. There is no doubt about it. We should be guided\nby a new inspiration and a spirit of dedication. Our commitment should not\nbe to any individual but to the future of the country and we are committed to\nit. As I see this spirit among millions of our countrymen, I am convinced that\nour country will be safe in the hands of the coming generations, in the\nhands of future leadership. Our job is to keep it intact and pass it on to the\nfuture leadership in a sound condition. This I would consider as my sincere\nand humble duty. I want to assure you that no effort will be spared by me to\nachieve this. Whatever difficulty I may have to face, I shall strive to\naccomplish this task."},{"year":1993,"pm":"P.V. Narasimha Rao","party":"INC","title":"Unity and Stability for Sustained Growth","footnote":"Free rendering of Independence Day speech in Hindi from the ramparts of the Red Fort, New Delhi, 15 August 1993","source":"P.V. Narasimha Rao, selected speeches, Vol 3","text":"I greet you all on the occasion of the 46th anniversary of our\nIndependence Day and, on this auspicious occasion, I congratulate you\nand extend to you my hearty felicitations.\n       As you know, we celebrated the Golden Jubilee of the Quit India\nMovement, a few days ago. This Movement was the most decisive part of\nour struggle for independence and within five years of this Movement we\nachieved our independence. Many freedom fighters who made great\nsacrifices for the freedom, are fortunately with us and many of them are no\nmore. We are grateful to all of them. The nation will never forget them and\ntheir names will be there in the history of India for ever.\n      Today, on 15th August, we are making a new beginning in the\ntechnological field. Till now, Doordarshan had only two channels. But from\ntoday, you will have six channels on Doordarshan. This is no small\nachievement. At the most one or two channels could have been added but\nour scientists have performed a miracle in space. The INSAT-2B satellite\ndesigned and fabricated by our scientists has been stationed in the\ngeocentric orbit and it is working quite perfectly. Consequently, from today\nyou have got six channels and gradually you will have more channels on\nthe Doordarshan. This satellite is one of the examples of our self-reliance in\nthe realm of science and technology.\n      Here I would also like to tell you something that relates to our national\nresolve. We needed an engine called cryogenic engine for the satellite.\nThere is no difficulty in buying the engine but some difficulty is there in the\ntransfer of technology. There are many reasons behind it but there is no\nneed to go into them now. We were to get this technology from Russia but\nnow there is a question mark on it. Then, what do we do? Should we give\nup our programme? Definitely not. We have decided and our scientists\nhave assured us that within two years they will develop the same\ntechnology indigenously and after that there would be no difficulty in\ndesigning, manufacturing and launching such satellites. The scientists have\nasked for two years time and till then we can purchase these engines and\nour satellite programme would continue without any hindrance.\n       This day is very memorable for us. On this day we take stock of\nsituation, dwell on our past and think of future. Let us look at the\nachievements of the Government and people of India during the last two\nyears. I would like to tell you briefly. It is not that you do not know about\nthem but still I would like to recall them. First let us have a look at our\neconomy. You have to make a comparison of the present state of economy\nwith the one which this Government inherited from the previous\nGovernments. The extent of progress we have made in two years is a\nmiracle in itself. This proves that our economic system was good, the\ninfrastructure was basically sound, but because it was distorted for one or\ntwo years, it went haywire. After this, we started mending it and it\nrecovered quickly. Therefore, there is no need to be pessimistic. The\nfoundation of this economic system, laid by our leaders during the last forty\nyears, is still very strong and it could steadily move forward only if the\nsystem is allowed to grow without any obstruction or attempt at distorting it.\n      You must have been reading about the inflation, which has today\ncome down to 5 percent from 17 percent within less than two years. What\ndoes it mean? It means that fluctuations in prices as prevailed in some\nother countries do not exist in our country and it shall never be so. Prices\nhave been controlled in a manner that whatever fluctuations there may be,\nit would always be within our control. You must have noticed that increase\nor decrease in prices in a year have remained confined within a small\nrange and have never gone beyond it. This is an indication of the strength\nof our economy.\n      Today, you have to take one more thing into consideration. It is the\namount of money that we received as deposits from outside. You may ask\nwhat was the need for it. This is required because we need foreign\nexchange. We have to import kerosene, fertilizers, machinery and we need\nforeign exchange to bring all these from abroad.\n     When this Government came to power, we had only about 2000 to\n2400 crore rupees in foreign exchange reserve. It was going to be\nexhausted within a week. I am happy to state that today, we have Rs.\n21000 crore, i.e., 7 billion dollars. Today, if you have to import from\nanywhere, you would have no problem. Our foreign exchange position is\nvery good. It is in such conditions that we are able to march forward with\nself-confidence and we are forging ahead.\n      The growth of the economy is also satisfactory. And the trade\nbalance, i.e. how much we export and how much we import is very\nimportant. If you import too much from outside, your foreign exchange\nreserves would deplete and get exhausted, but when you export more and\nimport less, there will be a favourable balance between the two. I am very\nhappy to say that for the first time in the history of free India, we have\nachieved the trade balance. Earlier we used to import more and export\nless. Now, both of these have come to an equal level and, for the first time,\nwe have a very comfortable position. So we will not be required to touch\nthe foreign exchange reserves that we have. The money we get from our\nexports shall be used for imports and this will keep up the trade balance,\n      Whatever programmes we have taken up, are mostly for the poor.\nToday, a comment, an irresponsible comment, is made that all the\nprogrammes formulated by this Government are for the rich. Nothing can\nbe farther from the truth. In fact, all our programmes are for the poor. We\nhave made enormous increase in the Jawahar Rozgar Yojana and rural\ndevelopment. If we look at this year's budget, the increase in allocations for\nthe programmes for rural development, education and health and many\nother schemes which directly benefit the poor and the rural population, no\none can say that these programmes are for the affluent section of the\nsociety only.\n      Of course, I must say, for industrialisation we don't have adequate\nresources. Ours is a poor country and the preceding Governments made it\npoorer. Today, what we need is capital investment. If this is not done, our\nindustry will not grow. If the industry does not grow, there would be\nunemployment, and in the absence of employment, there would be\nstarvation, unrest and the country would disintegrate. Hence, the most\nimportant thing is to improve our economy. For this we need to launch a\ngigantic program of industrialisation and we have done so.\n      I am happy to say that last year our industrialisation programme\nprogressed smoothly for about eight months, but after 6 December, and the\nbomb blasts in Bombay, it received a setback and slowed down. This\nhappens. If law and order or peace in the country is threatened, why should\nthe people from outside come here, even if they are our own people, and\ninvest their money? It became apparent that after the good record of eight\nmonths, their enthusiasm got dampened. But, on the whole, our\nindustrialisation programme is progressing well. Today, the country has\nabout 10,000 proposals for setting up small and big projects and they are\nabout to be set up.\n      While marching towards industrialisation, we have taken steps to\nensure that our workers do not suffer in any way. We have created a\nseparate fund for them with an amount of about 2,000 crore rupees. The\nworkers shall be helped with this money. They won't be allowed to remain\nwithout job. The money will be provided to them from this fund for training\nto redeploy them in any other job and care will be taken about their future.\n       Now, I come to agriculture. It is a matter of great pride for us that this\nyear's agricultural production has crossed all records of the past 40 years.\nWe have increased our production to this level and I, on behalf of the\npeople, the country, and on behalf of the Government of India, would like to\ncongratulate and felicitate the farmers of the country. Of course, farmer is\nthe \"Annadata\" but today he is also our exporter. For the first time, we are\nexporting our agricultural produce and this export can be on very large\nscale and we want to extend all support to this venture. The New\nAgricultural Policy lays great emphasis on the export of agricultural\nproducts. It will require more investments and more capital. We want to\ninvest more on irrigation because the more we invest, the higher will be the\nyield. India is among the very few nations of the world which can produce\nenough not only for feeding its own people but also for export. We have to\nmaintain this tempo. We have to give maximum benefit to our farmers.\n      In the last two years, you have noticed, the support prices that we\ngive to the farmers have been going up. For instance, the support price of\nwheat has been enhanced by Rs. 55 per quintal and gram by Rs. 100. We\nhave also raised the support price of different varieties of paddy between\nRs. 40 and Rs. 60 per quintal.\n       Have you or any farmer ever heard of an increase of such a\nmagnitude in the support price? There was a time when it was difficult to\ngive an increase of one or two rupees in the support price. At present, we\nare giving these higher support prices because the expenditure of farmer\nhas also increased. It is not a charity nor any obligation. Rather, the farmer\nis obliging us. We are only cooperating with and supporting him. Therefore,\nwe should fix a reasonable price and should not hesitate to pay that. If we\nwere to import foodgrains, we would have realised our burden and our\nconsequent expenditure. The farmer is saving a lot of foreign exchange for\nus. Once again, I would like to congratulate the farmer.\n       Another programme in the field of agriculture is that of crop\ninsurance. This programme existed earlier also, but had some lacunae in it.\nIt was thought to prepare a pilot scheme to be implemented next year. It\nwould cover the farmers and include all the crops. First we would\nimplement the scheme on pilot basis in one district of each State. When\nthis programme is extended to the whole country, the farmer would have no\nworry about the fate of his crops in the event of excessive rains, hailstorms,\nand drought. If the crop insurance programme runs well, the farmer would\nnot have to worry about these natural calamities.\n        It is well known that we have helped the farmers a lot in so far as\nfertilizers are concerned. We are giving them assistance of Rs. 1,000 per\ntonne. DAP and other fertilizers were available at cheaper rates in foreign\ncountries as compared to the rates of indigenous fertilizers. We, therefore,\nmoved swiftly to import them. The difference in prices of indigenously\nproduced and the imported fertilizers ranged between Rs. 2,000 to Rs.\n2,500 per tonne. We have imported fertilizers for the whole year. Today, I\nwould like to assure the farmers that they will have no worry about the\ncontinuous availability of fertilizer for a year. Whatever they want, and in\nwhatever quantity, is available in our country. There are some factories\nwhich have become unviable, the costs of their production have started\nincreasing. So we have given them many more facilities and made them\nviable. At present, they are also engaged in the production.\n      Now I would like to tell you a few things about the rural development.\nYou have heard about the outlay of Rs. 30,000 crore on rural development\nand this money is being used for the schemes which benefit the rural\npeople directly.\n      You may recall that last year I had announced a programme for\nartisans. There are lots of craftsmen and artisans in our villages but their\ntools are very old. These may be as old as 100 to 200 years. They work\nwith these obsolete tools; hence their productivity is restricted. We had\ndeclared that modern tools would be provided to all the rural craftsmen of\nthe country and we would take up a massive programme for providing\nthem. I am happy to say that we had taken up 62 districts last year and 100\nmore districts this year and by the end of current Five Year Plan, we would\nbe implementing this programme throughout the country.\n        The programme has proved beneficial. More than 1 to 1.5 lakh\nartisans have benefitted from this scheme and their productivity enhanced,\nso much so, some of the people who had left their hearth and home for the\ncities ultimately returned to the villages, for now they can earn the same\namount of money sitting in their homes in the village itself. So why should\nthey go to the cities? This is happening silently without any pomp or show.\nIn villages, the artisan is being convinced that new tool kits are beneficial to\nhim and artisans are profiting from this. This programme is not to be left\nhalf-way. The programme will go on during the entire Plan period until each\none of our artisans starts working with improved tools. In a way, this will\nbring about a revolution in the lives of artisans.\n     You are aware that a massive programme for the supply of drinking\nwater has been taken up. Almost all the villages known as revenue villages\nhave been covered. But every village also has small hamlets. Now these\nhamlets have to be covered because even if there are three-four hamlets or\neven 10 families, they also need water and their requirement is to be met.\nOne cannot say that since there are only a few people over there, they\nwould not require water. Everybody needs water. So to provide drinking\nwater to all, a massive programme is going on under the Rural\nDevelopment Department.\n       Now, the Panchayati Raj. After four years of intensive efforts,\novercoming obstacles, we have recently passed the Panchayati Raj Bill in\nParliament and State governments have also passed it in their Assemblies.\nIt has now become an Act. Within a year the country shall have a new\nstructure of Panchayati Raj wherein the people's power will find expression.\nThe power which was vested in them but suppressed, will emerge and you\nwill see that the Panchayat will take up impressive programmes of\ndevelopment. India shall witness a new enthusiasm and massive\nprogramme of development.\n      I would like to tell my sisters, that when the new Panchayat is\nconstituted, it will have thirty per cent women members in it. You should be\nprepared for shouldering such a heavy responsibility. Till now there used to\nbe few women in the Panchayat and they could not participate actively but\nnow the women will have to participate more actively in the Panchayats.\nThey will have to take over the work assigned to them. The reservation for\nScheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes already exists and will be\nmaintained in proportion to their population.\n      Last year, I had announced that we would form a Commission for the\nSafai Karmacharis. I am happy to announce that we have decided to form\nnot just a Commission, but a statutory Commission. The Bill to this effect is\nalready before Parliament for consideration. In the next few days it will be\npassed by Parliament. Safai Karmacharis belong to the backward\ncommunity. Their uplift is a must and we would not spare any effort to do it.\n      We are determined to eliminate the practice of carrying human\nexcreta on head which is still in vogue in some of our cities and small\ntowns. To eliminate the practice, we have made a provision of Rs. 111\ncrore this year. We would make every effort to provide Safai Karmacharis\nwith alternative employment. Once a Commission is formed, it will look into\ntheir problems and evolve measures to solve them. I want to assure our\nbrethren that the Commission's recommendations will receive full attention\nfrom the Government.\n       You might be aware of the constitution of the National Backward\nClass Financial Development Corporation. The Corporation has done a\ngood job. It has given loans to 25,000 people and has arranged for their\nlivelihood within a short span of one year. In the same way thousands more\nwill benefit from this Corporation.\n        I also want to tell our weavers that for the first time, a change in their\nlife is awaiting them. So far, they were never included in the schemes for\nthe rural development. For the first time now, the weavers have been\nincluded in these schemes currently being implemented in the rural areas.\nThey will be given looms, working sheds and working capital and for this a\nsum of Rs. 525 crore has been earmarked.\n       Now with this new programme, the weavers have a new hope for a\nbetter life. I want to congratulate them on this occasion and would like to\ntell them to take full advantage of these facilities.\n       In the meanwhile, there was drought in many States and floods in\nsome others. In fact, the situation was such that in the same State, in one\npart there was drought, while in the other part, there were floods. I visited\nsome of these States. We gave them timely help to provide relief to the\naffected people to the extent possible.\n      Floods are a recurring phenomenon. They visit us every year. Relief\nis provided. After the floods recede, all is forgotten till the next flood. This is\nnot proper. We have to think of some permanent solution to control the\nfloods. We will take all aspects into consideration. This task cannot be\ncompleted in a short time. It may take years. But we have to make a\nbeginning somewhere. I assure you that we would initiate action on this,\nwhether it is in Bihar or Uttar Pradesh or any other State. Otherwise the\ncurse of floods will always haunt our country.\n      Brothers, now I want to tell you about some new schemes and make\nsome announcements. In the last few days, we have taken stock of several\nschemes which are continuing in the country, but we will also have to\nintroduce some new schemes and implement them.\n       The first scheme relates to our sisters, especially those living in the\nrural areas. The present plight of the women is well known to everybody.\nThis situation needs improvement. Some of us are of the view that if the\nwomen are self-reliant in financial matters, they will be able to hold their\nheads high. A woman should get a status in the society. Her role should not\nbe confined to routine household work but she should be made an\nimportant constituent of the society, which is called empowerment. And\ntoday, we have to take up the programme of empowering the women. It is a\nvery important thing but it looks as though it would take a lot of time. Every\nadult woman of the country should have an account of her own in a bank or\nin a post office wherever possible so that she can get the status of an\naccount holder.\n      She should have the freedom of operating her account independently\nas others do. And she should be able to deposit or withdraw the money\nfrom that account, whether it is an amount of Rs. 100, Rs. 50 or even Rs.\n30. Therefore, we have taken up this scheme which involves a Government\nexpenditure of Rs. 1,000 crore. A woman who opens a savings account\nand deposits Rs. 300 within a year, the Government will give her Rs. 75\nand she will be getting Rs. 375 after a year. All this money will be hers. We\ndo not want to take anything from her, rather, we want to give Rs. 75 from\nour side. The Government will be incurring a loss on this scheme, but I am\nsure the kind of self-confidence that it will generate in women is priceless.\nNobody can assess the value of that self-confidence. Now that they are\npoised to shoulder the bigger responsibilities in Panchayat system, they\nshould know at least what is an account. Today, how many women are\nthere in the rural society who have their own independent account? There\nmust be very few, I guess. Tomorrow when crores of such accounts are\nopened, it would usher in a new revolution in the world of women. I want to\nreiterate my determination to implement this programme.\n       There are several voluntary organisations. Mahila Mandals as in the\nvillages. I want to appeal to them to help our women to run this programme\nwhich the Government has decided to implement by incurring a large\nexpenditure. These organisations need to provide their help only for one\nyear. Thereafter our womenfolk will them learn about this and will not seek\ntheir help. We must take up programme because it generates a new\nattitude.\n      An employment programme is currently going on in Maharashtra,\nKarnataka etc. Our entire scheme is also employment oriented and we\nhave to see how maximum number of people could be given employment.\nIn the rural areas, people get employment during the agricultural season\nbut during the course of the year there are at least 100 days, which are\ncalled lean days when there is not much agricultural activity. People remain\nidle. We have decided to provide them employment during these 100 days.\nThough it may not be guaranteed, but I assure them that those who are\nready to work will get work as is being done in Karnataka and Maharashtra\nat present. We want to adopt this scheme throughout the country. Though\nthe Jawahar Rozgar Yojana and other schemes are already there, the main\npurpose of this scheme is to provide assured employment to those who are\nunemployed. As I have announced last year, we want to implement this\nprogramme in all 1,700 backward blocks in the country where the poorest\nof the poor live and which are situated in the hilly, desert or the tribal areas.\nThe work will start in those blocks because maximum number of\nunemployed persons are there and people do not even get a square meal a\nday. Later it will be extended to cover the entire country.\n      The third programme is for our semi-educated youth who do not get\nemployment. Educated unemployed such as matriculates or undermatrics,\ndo not get work because perhaps their qualification is inadequate, or\nbecause there is no ready employment. For them, we have envisaged a\nscheme under which they can start their own small enterprises. Thousands\nof occupations, such as opening of shops, require only a little training for\nour youth. They do not require any high qualifications. We want to give\nemployment to such people. If two people start any joint enterprise, the\nGovernment would provide them Rs. one lakh as loan. Of this amount of\nRs. one lakh, Rs. 7,500 will be subsidy. We will provide training and other\n                                   ​ e think that within the remaining three\nfacilities to run the ​enterprise. W\nyears of the present Five Year Plan, we can provide such jobs to 10 lakh\nyouths of the country. We have made financial provision for this scheme.\nWe are announcing these three new schemes today because, we think that\nthese programmes can be completed during the remaining three years.\n       Now, I will turn to political scenario. As far as Punjab is concerned, I\nhave already said and you also know that there is now complete peace. If\nsomeone asks which is the most peaceful State in the country today, the\nanswer will be Punjab. This is the same Punjab which had been bleeding\nfor the last 12 years. This is a matter of pride for the people and the\nGovernment of Punjab, who have made it all\nPossible.\n      It is also a matter of pride for the men of our armed forces and police\nwho grappled with the terrorists and controlled them. On behalf of the\nnation, I extend the heartiest felicitation to them all. Punjab is our granary. If\nthere is any disturbance there, it will affect the entire country. But kudos to\nthe people of Punjab who made this miracle possible and maintained the\nagricultural production and did not allow it to slide down from its number\none position when the State was bleeding. This is a matter of great pride. I\nwant to congratulate them again. Now Punjab is poised for an industrial\nrevolution. All ground work has been done. You will see that in the next\ntwo-three years, there will be an industrial revolution along with the Green\nRevolution.\n      The situation in Kashmir has not improved as yet. There is only a\nmarginal improvement but we still have to do a lot. In Kashmir, the\nincitement, money and weapons and trained people come from Pakistan.\nThe trouble is not from within Kashmir but it comes from across the border.\nPeople of Kashmir are against terrorism. This, I can state with full\nconfidence. But when they face bullets, they are naturally scared. Though\npeople do not say it, but if terrorism comes to an end, they will be very\nhappy and heave a sigh of relief. There is no doubt about it. While Pakistan\nis carrying out false propaganda about human rights violation in J. & K. only\ntwo days ago the terrorists from that country stopped a bus midway and\npulled out 16 or 17 people and shot them dead. Do they mean that those\nwho have been the victims of their bullets have no human rights? Have\nthey no right to live? Only when the terrorists get killed in encounters, why\ndo these people get perturbed, why do they campaign for upholding the\nhuman rights? Do only the terrorists have human rights? They have a right\nto kill others and they also have human rights to the effect that nobody\nshould kill them. This is a warped logic beyond comprehension and we are\nnot prepared to accept it. I would like to congratulate those who fought\nagainst terrorism and caught many terrorists and have tried to bring the\nsituation somewhat under control. This process will continue. Pakistan may\ndo whatever it wants, but Kashmir is an inalienable part of India. Nobody\ncan separate it from India, whatever means they may use. Recently,\nPakistan had reached where it would have been declared a terrorist state.\nNow when they provide weapons and other material for promoting\nterrorism, whom they are harming? I would like to appeal to them and also\nwarn them that this plan will benefit no one of them in any case. India will\nremain unmoved from its position that Kashmir will remain an integral part\nof India and we will always serve the people of Kashmir in every possible\nmanner and solve their problems. Nothing can be achieved from this\nbloodshed.\n      Issues have come up about Assam, Bodoland and recently\nJharkhand. Certain problems are considered by locals as a matter of life\nand death because when a movement is carried on for a long time without\nany result, one feels bad. One becomes irritated and loses self-control.\nAssam problem has been solved. Bodoland problem has been solved and\nthe matter relating to Jharkhand will also be resolved shortly. We should,\ntherefore, not get impatient. There is no need to get excited and lose one's\ntemper. This is a message, I have for them.\n      In so far as Ayodhya is concerned, I was hesitant to comment on the\nissue. But it is necessary to say that there has been such destruction that\nhas tarnished India's image. Abroad. India's image looks sullied. We\nappear to be destructive. We have been known as a peace loving nation for\nthe past 5000 years. Now the opinion all over the world about us has\nundergone a change and people are wondering how we have given in to\nviolence. We are not covered with more glory. On the contrary, we have\nbeen defamed. People have started doubting our cultural traditions and our\npeace loving nature. I would say that no condemnation of this\ndisrespectable act will be adequate. But the irony is that this act is being\nprojected as praiseworthy. If somebody goes abroad to project the\ndemolition as a good act, this further spoils our image.\n       I want to emphasise that it is not a good move. Within a short span of\ntime, it would be clear as to who was responsible for this. It will also be\nknown as to how it was done, who did it and who were behind it.\n       Today, I want to tell you that only one motive is working behind these\nthings. It has become a habit to misuse religion for political purposes.\nPolitics is a good thing, so is religion. Without religion, there is no direction,\none becomes confused. Religion, whichever it may be, is meant for guiding\nour lives to the right path. Politics shows the way for the organisation of\nsociety and the organisation of the state. Religion and politics both have\ntheir rightful places in their appointed spheres. But when both are mixed\nand religion is used for political purposes, religion does not remain religion,\nit takes the shape of communalism. We have to stand unitedly and fight\nagainst communalism. It includes the government and the people. No\nsacrifice is too big for it. For the past few years, communalism is raising its\nhead and if this situation is allowed to continue, there will be no future for\nour country and the nation will fall apart. Once it is accepted that one\nreligion is superior and another is inferior, one is good and the other is bad,\nthen there will be no unity in this country, no integrity. The nation will\ndisintegrate. It is not mentioned in any religion to hate or to look down upon\nother religions. All are equal. Whether it is a majority or a minority in our\ncountry, all are equal under our Constitution. Whatever the number, even\nthe miniscule has the same rights that are enjoyed by the majority. That is\nwhy we have to assert that any such discrimination will not work in this\ncountry, and shall not be tolerated. You have also to assert that whosoever\nviolates the Constitution, cannot do it for all time to come. One may do it for\none or two days, in one election or two elections, but soon people will\nunderstand and will teach such violaters a lesson. I want to impress that we\nhave to get rid of these things. Religion should be kept separate from\npolitics. We have to give importance to both. Follow your religion, nobody\nhas any objection. Go and work for your respective parties, give details of\nyour programmes to the people, get votes and rule. Nobody has any\nobjection. But, no one has a right to ask for votes in the name of Hindu or\nIslam or Christianity. No one has a right to exploit the sentiments of the\npeople, by creating a frenzy fundamentalism. This should never be allowed\nto happen, this is my appeal to you.\n     Secularism is our life breath. The moment it stops, our breath will\ncease, nation's breath will cease. The Government is making efforts to\npreserve our secular character. A Bill has been brought before Parliament\nwhich prohibits the use of religion in politics. However, law alone is not\nenough.\n      There is a need for spreading awareness among the masses about\nthe dangers of using religion in politics. Each and everyone should be\nmade aware of this. I want to stress that whatever we are doing should be\nsupplemented by you. All of us have to work together for its success.\n       I was speaking of destruction. How do we react to destruction?\nDestruction cannot be countered with destruction. If somebody brings down\na structure, the response cannot be the destruction of something else.\nWhatever has been demolished, will have to be built, rebuilt. No one knows\nhow many cities had been destroyed during the last World War. Hundreds\nof cities were razed to the ground. London was afire and half of it was\ndestroyed. But nobody despaired. Each and every building destroyed was\nreconstructed after the Great War; so also destroyed cities were\nreconstructed; half of London which was destroyed was rebuilt; in a better\nmanner than the earlier ones. Today, we should not kneel down before\nthese destructive forces and particularly, the destruction in Ayodhya. We\nwill not accept defeat and will respond to the destruction by reconstruction.\nI not only assure you of this but also call upon all of you to come forward. If\nwe work unitedly, the recent past of Ayodhya, which has left a scar in the\nhearts of the people will disappear. Only then will we be able to make\nsecularism a success in this country.\n      As regards foreign affairs, you are aware that India has been very\nactive during the past two years. We are hosting in our country a meeting\nof G-15, a forum of developing countries. There are a number of\nprogrammes that developing countries have to undertake. In the\ncompetition between North and South, India has always been playing an\nexcellent role on behalf of developing countries.\n      I hope India will succeed in her efforts and developing countries will\ncontinue to march forward and achieve prosperity. Their programmes for\ndevelopment will be successfully implemented.\n       New complaints, disputes and controversies are developing today in\nthe sphere of environment. They need to be solved. Not through\nconfrontation but through discussions and dialogues, because through\nconfrontation we would not succeed. Gone are the days when there were\ntwo power blocs. They used to quarrel some times directly: at other times\nby provoking groups having allegiance to them and instigating the latter to\nindulge in small skirmishes. Now the situation has changed. In the new\nsituation we have to move forward through our reasoning and strong will. If\nyou have a strong will, you will succeed.\n      Our relations with the neighbouring countries, except Pakistan, are\ngood. We can have good relations with Pakistan too. I have met the\nPakistan Prime Minister about half a dozen times. Our personal relations\nare very cordial but when it comes to matters of policy, it is difficult to say\nanything. Elections are going to be held shortly in Pakistan and a new\nleadership will take over. I hope the new leadership will come with greater\nsense of realism and will have the courage to accept the reality and then\nalone could there be further and meaningful dialogue between us.\n       There need be no doubt on this. We are ready for talks, but one thing\nis clear, Kashmir is an indivisible part of India. It has been and wiIl remain\nso. If this reality is accepted, there will be friendship and cooperation. I\nwant to give this assurance. I want to give the same assurance to Pakistan,\nour neighbour and that it should forget about making efforts to separate\nKashmir from India. That efforts have been made time and again and\ncampaigning and spending have been going on. But now Pakistan must\nforget this. We can remain good friends forever on this basis and our\nfriendship will serve as a model to the world.\n      Friends, I have taken much of your time. Today, whatever we are\ndoing, we are doing for millions of our poor brothers and sisters. There are\nelements who are attempting to disturb our economic reforms by saying\nthat money is being brought from outside, why it is being brought and on\nwhat will it be spent?\n      Whatever may be the source of money, it will be used to set up\nindustry in India. The investor will not take away the industry to his country.\nHe will construct railways, roads. I have already stated whatever\ninfrastructure is created, it will remain with us. Now, the foreign investor\nmay remain for whatever time in the country. Later he may like to go away.\nStructures raised by him will belong to the country. At the most, we have to\npay him. They are welcome to join hands with us in the development of\nIndia as they are doing in other countries. They are welcome and millions\nof our people will be benefited and we are determined to achieve this. I am\nnot satisfied with 30,000 crore rupees. Had it been 50,000 crores or more, I\nwould have been happier. Had it been one lakh crore rupees it would have\nmade me still happier. But we don't have that sort of money. We will do\nwhatever we can.\n      So many civilizations have spread from India. India has been the\nbirthplace of many civilizations. Today, we have to save ourselves from the\ndoubts in the minds of people regarding our civilization, our culture and our\npeace-loving nature. Otherwise, our glory, our image and our structure will\nbe adversely affected and it will be very difficult to regain them. One more\nthing I want to say. If our attention is diverted from our economic\nprogrammes even for a month, then it would lead to severe economic loss.\nOne should appreciate this. There were bomb blasts in Bombay. Our\nFinance Ministry says that on conservative estimates within a span of one\nor two months, we suffered a loss of about ten thousand crore rupees. In\ntwo months, if we suffer a loss of ten thousand crore rupees just because\nsome mad person throws a bomb, what does it mean? In such a big\ncountry, will we allow me or three bombs to put the economy in disarray?\nHow will we work? We will just not permit this to happen.\n       We do not tolerate any bomb blast. Wherever it occurs, I assure you,\nit would be dealt with. Preventive measures will be taken and those\ninvolved will be punished. But if such an incident does occur once in a\nwhile, why should it divert our attention from the path of economic\nprogress? We want to move towards one direction only and it is the\ndirection of economic progress. We are already lagging behind. Many\nsmaller countries have gone much ahead of us. In case, for another two or\nthree years, we get bogged down with Hindu Muslim riots, caste disputes\nand political and religious conflicts, and do not pay single-minded attention\nto economic progress, then our future will be bleak. This is the warning, we\nare receiving from all over the world. Our wisdom is also sounding a note of\nwarning. Whether we listen to the voice of sanity or not, it is up to us. I\nwould say, we must listen to it. I will give you an example from an\nUpanishad. There is a dancer. She is dancing while the musical\ninstruments are being played and songs are being sung. She has a pitcher\non her head. She would not allow the pitcher to fall, dance she must, her\nwhole body would sway, but the pitcher would remain on her head.\nMaulistha Kumbha Parirakshana Dhiranativa. This is what our attitude\nshould be. Let there be any calamity: let us be involved in any other\nactivity; but the pitcher of development placed on our head, the pitcher of\nadvancement, the pitcher of economic programmes that pitcher should\nnever be allowed to topple down. This caution is a must for us. If we are\ncautious enough to keep moving forward, there will be no problem for us.\n       In the comity of nations, India has taken her appropriate place and we\nwill continue to strive to improve our position. Many opportunities are\nawaiting us. Soon the Security Council will be expanded. The UN has a\nnumber of programmes in which we have to play a greater role. We have\nalways been active there. Wherever there has been a dispute, people start\nlooking towards India, for we are not in favour of aggravating differences.\nWe are among those who are for peace. We ourselves are peace-loving\npeople. Hence, we have an important place there. But a country which is\nnot internally strong cannot be considered strong abroad. Therefore, I\nwould like to say with due respect to you that whether we belong to the\nminority or majority or any other faith or are even atheist, it does not matter.\nThis is a matter of individual faith. I have already stated that there would\nnot be any discrimination in so far as minorities are concerned. They are in\nminority only in numbers, but from the point of view of citizenship they are\nequal. Everybody would enjoy the same rights. This is what I want to say.\nToday minorities feel insecure with regard to their life and property. Recent\nriots have increased this sense of insecurity; they are scared. In this\ncontext I would mention to you that the police force is there to keep law and\norder. In this force we have introduced battalions of Rapid Action Force.\nAlready five battalions have been formed and another five are under\ntraining. We wish to increase the number of these battalions since this\nmixed force can be deployed wherever or whenever riots occur and will\nsuccessfully restore law and order. The members of the Rapid Action Force\nwill undergo a little more intensive training than an ordinary policeman. This\ntraining will be very comprehensive. It will be a complete action. The idea of\nRapid Action Force was conceived during the time of Smt Indira Gandhi\nand also considered during the period of Rajivji. But I feel proud that I got\nthe opportunity to implement the idea and we are pursuing these ideas and\nschemes relentlessly.\n      We have founded a National Minority Finance and Development\nCorporation with an authorised capital of Rs. 500 crore only a day or two\nago. When we decided to have this Corporation, we were considering\nwhether it would be correct from the legal point of view. Then we came to\nthe conclusion that the setting up of this Corporation is perfectly in order.\nThere is nothing wrong in it. People will see that on one hand we will do\neverything possible to protect the life and property of the minorities and on\nthe other, we will also do whatever is essential for the economic uplift of\nminorities. Of course, the Minority Commission has already been vested\nwith statutory powers. Its recommendations will be accepted to the extent\npossible.\n      Maulana Azad Education Foundation will be utilised as a medium for\nfurther educating the people belonging to minorities. We will give the\nFoundation more fund, more help. We will make the Foundation an\ninstrument to serve more and more people in the field of education.\n      In the context of Waqf Act, either a new law will be enacted or a\nnumber of amendments will be made in the existing law. This will help\nprevent irregularities regarding Waqf properties. There are a number of\nprogrammes, for instance, there is the 15-point programme. There are\nother programmes too, but as we are short of time, we cannot go into\ndetails. However I want to emphasise once again that whether it be the\nminority or majority, they have to live together. Nobody will go from this\nplace. We will stay here together. This is our determination.\n       Therefore, the signal that we would like to send to the world today is:\nWe will not allow our unity and integrity to suffer and will not allow our\nachievements to fritter away. This is a new responsibility which we have to\nshoulder. We pray to the Lord Almighty to give us strength so that we may\ngo forward and proceed towards our goal. From Mahatma Gandhi to Rajivji\nall the leaders have shown the way to our countrymen. Proceeding on that\npath, we have to tell the world that our steps would never falter. We will\ncontinue to move forward on the path shown by them and we shall redeem\nourselves along with the country and will be able to redeem the human\nrace as well.\n      In this great task of redeeming the human race, we will fulfil our\nresponsibility. With this determination and resolve we assemble here\ntogether once again on this fifteenth of August. All the countrymen,\nwherеvеr уоu аrе, who are listening to me in every nook and corner, I wish\nto congratulate and thank all of you once again. I wish you happiness and\nprosperity in the coming year."},{"year":1992,"pm":"P.V. Narasimha Rao","party":"INC","title":"Towards Hopeful Future","footnote":"Free rendering of Independence Day speech in Hindi from the ramparts of the Red Fort, 15 August 1992","source":"P.V. Narasimha Rao, selected speeches, Vol 2","text":"I open my hearty greetings to you on this auspicious occasion of the\nforty-fifth anniversary of independence. This year has got a special\nsignificance because we are celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of \"Quit\nIndia Movement.” We salute the people whose great sacrifices won\nindependence for the country. We want to draw inspiration from them and\nwherever they are, whether in the country or abroad, I beseech their\nblessings on this occasion. We have undertaken a gigantic task which is\nreally stupendous and our journey is very long but I am confident that with\ninspiration from them, our task would become easier.\n       Friends, I had spoken to you from here a year ago. I had then\npresented before you a brief outline of conditions prevailing, and the\neconomic situation that we had inherited. A year has gone by in facing\nthese challenges and I am happy to say that in our endeavour during the\nyear we have achieved considerable success. I think that the conditions\nthat you see today are vastly different from what they were last year. Today\nyou can see a picture of stability in the country. There is no doubt that last\nyear there were question marks about the stability but today no one inside\nor outside the country thinks that there is any instability. This picture of\nstability has been very helpful in carrying forward the programme of\neconomic reforms and in maintaining social harmony that I had referred to\nlast year. However, a lot remains to be done. You are aware that during\nlast one year the country has not witnessed any upheaval that could have\ndamaged or unsettled our social structure. Some small disturbances have\nerupted occasionally here and there and they were brought under control\nand today the overall situation is by and large peaceful. The stream of life is\nflowing peacefully and there are no storms. This is highly gratifying\nbecause this is the kind of environment that we need to move ahead on the\npath of progress.\n      Last year on behalf of the Government, I had adopted a new method\nof functioning through consensus. Now also I feel that this is the correct\nmethod for the country because the national problems are not problems of\nany particular party. They are problems which need to be placed above\nparty politics and these problems have their bearing upon the entire nation\nand, therefore, they have to be tackled accordingly. They can be resolved\nonly by taking all the parties, sections and communities into confidence. I\nwant to reiterate that we shall continue to adhere to it.\n       As far as the economy is concerned, we have achieved substantial\nsuccess in this direction. You know the difficulties that we were facing last\nyear so much so that we had to pledge our gold. The gold has since been\nbrought back. Our foreign exchange reserves were not more than Rs.\n1,000 crores and perhaps, within a week we would have defaulted and our\ncredibility would have been ruined. We had to start from such a difficult\nsituation. Very carefully and cautiously we took certain steps and today I\nam happy to say that our foreign exchange reserves have touched the\npeak of Rs. 17.000 crores and we have no difficulty in importing anything\nthat we may require.\n      On the other hand, as a result of the measures taken during the year,\nour exports are showing signs of growth. On this front there were a few\ndoubts but during the last month and a half I find that our exports have\nstarted rising. This means that our industries are operating, production is\nincreasing and we are again in a position to increase our exports.\n       We have also succeeded in attracting foreign investment for\nindustrialisation within the country. We have received proposals of the\norder of Rs. 3,000 crores. This investment may take a little time to actually\nmaterialise but this is a significant amount not only in terms of money but\nalso from the point of view of technology. Along with this there are bright\npossibilities of greater investment of capital by our industrialists in the\ncountry.\n      The proposals that we have received indicate that there will be\ninvestment of about 35-40 thousand crore rupees from within the country\nwhich will give a big boost to our industrialisation.\n      Only a month and a half back, it was apprehended that rainfall may\nbe subnormal and could create some difficulties. But now I understand that\nthe country has had good rains and as a result, the crops are likely to be\ngood. And, therefore, we can hope that there will be general prosperity in\nthe country and we would not have to face difficulties like drought.\n      Now, I want to present before you a few things relating to our policies\nand I think they should be clearly understood. First of all, I would like to tell\nyou that we are engaged in a massive programme of country-wide\neconomic reforms in the shape of Eighth Five Year Plan which envisages\nan outlay of about 4.5 lakh crore rupees. When we are engaged in such a\nlarge venture, it is absolutely essential that we should concentrate on that\nand our attention should not be distracted. It is possible that there may be\nsome disturbances to divert our attention. Some of them may be on\naccount of the circumstances but others will be due to a deliberate design.\nBut, we have to overcome routine problems and concentrate our energies\non development and progress and the Government is determined to do so.\n       Second point that I would like to present before you is that the\nGovernment is a powerful institution, but the question is for what end this\npower should be used. It is our belief and commitment that this powerful\ninstitution should be used for the protection of people who are powerless,\nwho are weak and vulnerable and who are unable to protect themselves.\nPowerful people in the society can take care of themselves, but the\nGovernment must prominently help those who are not in a position to help\nthemselves. But, when we want the Government to be the protector of the\nweak, we face certain problems in functioning, we must understand them.\n        For the last 40 years, we have been implementing Five Year Plans.\nStill, in whichever village we visit, we see development lacking there.\nSchool buildings or roads may be in a state of disrepair and there are many\nthings about which people have their general complaints. These complaints\nare valid.\n       On the other hand there are big industries each having an investment\nof four to five thousand crore rupees and yet we do not get any return on\nthis investment. We are not getting even the minimum profit or returns. It is\na set back. Consequently, in both the areas, it is the people's money or the\nGovernment's money that is invested but we feel that neither sector is\nperforming well and delivering the goods and services. At the same time\nwe continue to face shortage of funds for development in both the areas.\nThe main reason is that we do not have enough funds in the country to\ninvest in both the fields. This is nothing new. We have seen this during the\nperiod of Jawaharlal Nehru, Indiraji and Rajivji. During the period of all the\nPrime Ministers, we have experienced that capital available is not adequate\nto meet all our requirements. And, therefore, today we have to adopt a new\napproach.\n      Suppose we have to set up a big industry or a plant which needs\n5000 crore rupees, then this is the people's money. But if we find some\nindustrialist who is prepared to invest this amount of 5,000 crore rupees,\nthen Government will be in a position to save this amount to invest\nelsewhere. I have worked out that if in this manner we can save 5,000\ncrore rupees from just one big industry, we can build one lakh primary\nschools. Thus if for these massive projects we could mobilise capital from\noutside or from other sources, our own money could be spent on all the\nneeds of the poor. Just imagine if we can find some​ ​other sources for\ninvestment in infrastructure, in power projects, irrigation etc., our own\npeople's money would be free for investment in rural areas to help those\nwho are not so far getting the funds on the desired scale. This is a new\napproach. Not absolutely new, but the emphasis is new. We want that our\nown funds must be freed from the infrastructure sector by mobilising\ninvestment in that sector from other sources either within the the country or\nfrom the people of Indian origin settled abroad. If for power, irrigation,\ncement or steel plants we get investment from other sources, there will be\nrapid progress in both the rural and industrial sectors because development\nin both the fields is essential. Thus this programme of replacement of\ncapital by arranging money for one sector from other sources is likely to be\nvery advantageous. We will see that our rural programmes would gain\nmomentum in the Eighth Five Year Plan. With great difficulty we could have\nprovided 14,000 crore rupees for rural programmes for five years, but now\nwe have decided that this outlay should be raised from 14,000 to 30,000\ncrore rupees. Thus you will see that we can step up the rural programmes\non a large scale.\n      I feel these programmes should move still faster. If instead of 30,000\ncrore rupees we raise this outlay to 50,000 crore rupees it would be still\nbetter. We are engaged in the efforts to ensure that the funds that are freed\nfrom investment in big projects and programmes are invested in villages.\n       Many people are nervous about the consequences of foreign\ninvestment in the country. I want to assert that after all, the plant will be set\nup in India. There is no possibility that projects built from foreign investment\nwould run away from the country. If roads are built and railway lines are\nlaid, they are bound to remain within the country and there is nothing to be\napprehensive about it. Let us welcome all the investment that is available\nbecause this capital ultimately will be ours and we will derive benefit out of\nit. Anyone who makes investment would obviously like to make some profit\nand there should be no objection to this, as no one would like to invest if\nthere is no profit in the investment. We should also make it a point to invest\nthe capital that is freed from this investment, in rural programmes.\n      Now, I want to present before you some details about the\nprogrammes which we have undertaken for the poor during the last one\nyear. Last year, I had submitted before you that we would undertake these\nprogrammes. I want to apprise you now that we have already started these\nprogrammes and they are progressing. First programme I told you was\nabout 1,700 blocks where the population consists of very poor people. We\nwant to undertake a new programme to make foodgrains available to them.\nI am very happy that this programme has been launched on a large scale\nfrom 1 January 1992 in 1711 blocks. I launched this programme from\nRajasthan and now this is being taken up everywhere. There was a\nshortage of fair price shops. Within six or seven months we have opened\n9,000 to 10,000 fair price shops. Perhaps during the next few months we\nare going to start 10,000 more. In addition, we are providing additional 20\nlakh tonnes of foodgrains for such areas so that the deficit in supplies there\nis made up. We have linked this programme with Jawahar Rozgar Yojana.\nWe have made a special allotment of eight lakh tonnes of foodgrains for the\npurpose.\n        The intention is that under Jawahar Rozgar Yojana, part of the wages\nmust be paid in the shape of foodgrains so that labourers do not face\nstarvation. And it is our estimate that when part of the wages are paid in the\nshape of foodgrains each person would get two kg of rice or wheat per day\nand in this manner we would be able to overcome the problem of starvation\nin those areas.\n        Another problem that I talked about last year was about rural artisans\nstill using outmoded tools. They are unable to increase their productivity\nand to get rid of their poverty. They are migrating to big cities, and a new\nproblem is emerging there. I had said that to upgrade these tools we would\nbe undertaking a large programme of modernisation. I am happy to say that\nthis programme has already taken off. In the current year, we are going to\nimplement the programme of equipping artisans in 40,000-50,000 villages\nwith modern tools and this programme will continue during the next four to\nfive years. It is a very massive but very useful programme because if the\nrural artisans do not stay in the village, the village would never prosper, and\nremain backward. Therefore, this programme has been launched.\n        Next I had said that the revenue records and the records of rights\nover land in our villages are not maintained properly. The result is that\nthere is protracted litigation which often leads to bloody fights and\ntherefore, a programme for their improvement was needed. I am happy to\ninform you that we have addressed ourselves to this task and a scheme\nhas already been framed. We are going to call a meeting of Revenue\nMinisters to urge them to complete this job within a specified timeframe,\nmay be a year or two.\n        About land ceiling I had said that whatever land is available with the\nGovernment under the ceiling laws and which has not been distributed\nwould be distributed completely. This work has nearly been completed.\nOnly a part of it is yet to be completed. On a large scale about two lakh\nacres of land has been distributed and it is our determination that within\nthree to four months, we should reach a stage in which there should be no\nundistributed surplus land. The entire land will be given to landless people.\nThis programme will also be completed.\n       As declared last year, a corporation for the welfare of the backward\nclasses has been set up. I am happy to inform you that this corporation has\nbeen started with a capital of Rs. 200 crore and a complete programme has\nbeen chalked out for the welfare of the backward classes.\n       The changes which are taking place at present could in some cases\naffect our workers in the industrial sector. To protect them from any\nadverse impact, we have set up a National Renewal Fund with a capital of\nabout Rs. 2,200 crores. We would ensure that wherever our workers are\nadversely affected and wherever there is a problem of employment for\nthem, we would extend full help to them out of this fund. We will also\nensure that they face no difficulty and whatever programmes for their\nretaining etc., are needed, are funded out of this fund.\n       I would like to draw special attention of our farmers in far-flung areas\nwhere there is no electricity and perhaps where it is not possible to provide\nelectricity in the near future. For such villages we have formulated a solar\nenergy programme in the Five Year Plan with an outlay of Rs. 800 crores.\nNever before was so much attention paid and so much money provided for\nsuch a programme. This is largely because our Lord Surya is the biggest\nsource of energy for us.\n       We should fully exploit this source. Here comes the question of\ntechnology. Theoretically this is possible, but, when the question of\ntechnology comes, it is said that these solar pumps are very costly and\nfarmers cannot afford them.\n       On the basis of the results of experiments made by our scientists, it\ncan now be said that by reduction in costs, we can bring them within the\naffordable limit of our farmers. Efforts in this direction have been successful\nand the result is that in our far-flung areas where there is no electricity,\nthere will be “stand alone” units on wells, that is, each well will have a solar\npanel installed on it, along with the pump. The solar panel would draw\nenergy from the Sun and convert this into electricity which would energise\nthe pump. This programme would be undertaken on a large scale and this\nwould meet the energy requirements of the villagers. Whatever electricity is\nrequired for other purposes in the village will be generated there itself.\n       Wherever these experiments have been made, they have been very\npopular with the farmers. The reason is that normal electricity is not reliable\nbecause of its erratic supply, and therefore, it adversely affects agriculture.\nHence, this new energy programme has appealed to them. I am happy to\ninform you that we are going to launch this programme on a large scale.\nI referred to Five Year Plans. We are going to undertake a massive\nprogramme of wasteland development because there are large areas of\nwasteland in all the villages. We are making efforts to develop them by\nplanting trees and to make them green and fertile. This programme will\nprovide employment to millions of people. With this in mind, we have set up\na new department so that proper attention is paid to this programme. We\nhave made a large financial provision for this in our Plan.\n      Now, I want to inform you that the programme we have launched\nduring the last one year for the welfare of weaker sections and minorities\nhave been carried out on a large-scale. For Scheduled Castes and\nScheduled Tubes, a Corporation has been formed. For women, a National\nCommission has been set up. To make them fully effective to enable them\nto carry out their responsibilities, we have vested them with sufficient\npowers. Similarly, the Minorities Commission has also been given statutory\nstatus and vested with wide powers to protect interests of the minorities.\nThus, this Commission is now as empowered as any other statutory\ncommission. We hope that this would be very helpful and effective for the\nprotection and progress of the minorities.\n      As I said just now, a Corporation has been set up for the backward\nclasses; we want that the profession of safai karamcharis which is below\nhuman dignity should be abolished. In the Eighth Five year Plan, we have\nprovided 560 crore rupees for this. There is no doubt that, if required, this\nprovision can be enhanced. Along with this we have decided to constitute a\ncommission to look into the problems of our safai karamcharis. This\nCommission is in a process of constitution and it would come into being in\nthe next few days. This will go a long way in understanding the problems of\nthe neglected section of the society.\n       I would now like to dwell upon a few issues which we have inherited\nand which we are facing. You know about Punjab where after long years an\nelected Government has come into power. I am very happy that this\nGovernment is doing a good job and people are extending their full\ncooperation to it. I would also tell you in the context of Punjab that we are\nfully seized of the problems which have emerged there and we are very\nserious about finding solutions to them. There can be no hasty decision\nand we have to take every step with a cool mind in consultation with all\nconcerned. Though some people say that nothing is happening, let me\nassure that this is not so. Shortly you will have an indication of what we\nintend to do and in which direction we are moving. In the meantime, law\nand order is being maintained effectively, and as you all know we have\ngained some successes. It is true that killings are still continuing. This is not\na happy situation. It shocks us and hurts us. But when we are locked in this\nstruggle, some losses are inevitable. But by and large the situation there is\nsatisfactory and I am waiting for the day when complete peace will prevail\nin Punjab. It is a different thing that abetment from across the border is still\ncontinuing there. It is a matter of deep regret that despite our repeated\npleas, our neighbour across the border is not desisting from such activities.\n      The situation has improved in Assam and there is no doubt about it.\nThere has been significant improvement and those who were following the\npath of violence have decided to give it up and join the national\nmainstream. The majority of such people have come back and surrendered\ntheir weapons. But there are still a few of them who are carrying on\nconfrontation. We have to tackle them and this is what is being done there.\nI hope that this situation would be brought under control shortly.\n      Kashmir issue is still hanging fire and the situation is taking uneven\nturns but an overall assessment would suggest that the things are under\ncontrol. I am not satisfied with this because we cannot be satisfied till every\ncorner of India comes within the democratic set up. I want to make it clear\nthat whenever the conditions are conducive there, we are keen to hold free\nand fair elections within the framework of Indian Constitution and to install a\npopular Government.\n      About the issue of Mandal Commission, I have already made my\nstand very clear. Right now the issue is before the Supreme Court. In due\ncourse, the judgement will come and it will be implemented. Government's\nstand is that backward classes must get 27 per cent reservation and\namong them between a poor and a rich candidate, the poor must get it first.\nBut on the whole, the reserved jobs must be given to backward classes and\nshould not go beyond. This is our decision. We also want to give 10 per\ncent reservation to those who are economically backward. The matter is\nbefore the Supreme Court and we will implement its judgement.\n        Now I come to an issue which was threatening to assume a\ndangerous shape sometime ago. I am grateful to those people who were\ninvolved in this and because of whose cooperation we could ward off this\ncountrywide crisis. I am referring to the Ayodhya dispute. This is not just an\nissue of a temple or a mosque. I want to make it very clear that it would be\nmisleading and wrong to view it purely as a problem of temple or mosque.\nThis is a problem of unity of our country. Today the problem is to preserve\nand sustain the traditional harmony which has been existing for centuries in\nlakhs of villages of our country and the society. If we take a single wrong\nstep, we must ponder over the consequences of such a wrong move for the\ncountry, leave alone the temple or mosque. Therefore, we have to take\nevery step very carefully and with circumspection. Somehow we have been\nable to defuse it at a point where it had taken a dangerous turn. There is\nstill some time available. Within this time limit we want to arrive at a\nsettlement after consultation with all concerned. This is the consistent\npolicy of the Government that a solution to this problem should be evolved\nthrough negotiations with all concerned. Such a solution must satisfy the\nreligious sentiments of both the communities. For some reason if this is not\npossible, then the decision of the court would be binding on all. And in fact\nthis is our formula in a nutshell. It is our desire that a grand temple should\nbe built there, but the mosque must remain intact. We would like to pursue\nthis aim in our efforts. During the talks if it is possible to find a solution that\nis acceptable to all, then it would be a very happy development and none\nwould object to it. The people of the country must know what the\nGovernment is doing and with what aim.\n       Now, I would like to say something about the international situation.\nOur relations with our neighbouring countries are improving very well.\nHowever, it is difficult to say the same thing in the context of Pakistan. I\nhave had talks with the Prime Minister of Pakistan four times. Our talks\nhave been very good, but when the time comes to take a step ahead, some\ndevelopment or the other takes place that leaves us where we were. Who\nis doing this? Why? And how? This is a matter of one's own conjecture. I\nthink the talks will have to continue. But we should be very clear in our\nminds that Kashmir is an integral part of India and no power on earth can\nseparate Kashmir from India. This is our basic position. If this is accepted,\nwe can consider any other understanding or compromise required, and will\ncontinue to work for improvement in our relations. But this will be our\nbottom line. There should be no doubt about this.\n       With other countries like America, Britain, Germany, Japan etc., our\nrelations are very good. Whatever new countries have come into existence\nafter the disintegration of USSR, which was our close friend, our relations\nare very good with them. Their Heads of State have visited our country and\nI have also received invitations to visit their countries. Our relations with\nthem are getting closer and friendlier.\n       India has to play a more active role in international relations. We have\nthe Non-Aligned Movement. We have seen that there has been slight let-up\nin this Movement during these last two to three years. We will reactivate it.\n      Now, in the end I would like to make a few submissions. In this\ncountry where the majority of our people are honest and law abiding, there\nare also some corrupt elements. Some people indulged in loot and illegal\ndeals in banks and the stock market. This episode surfaced suddenly and\nthen we realised that before the lapses are covered up or the evidence\ndestroyed, action should be taken against those who are guilty.\n      As soon as the Government got the information, all necessary steps\nwere taken. The persons have been arrested. A special court has been set\nup. The investigation is going on in full swing and let me assure you that\nwhosoever is involved in this and whosoever is found guilty would be dealt\nwith strictly and severe punishment would be awarded. As far as prevention\nof recurrence of such activities is concerned, it is now for the Parliament to\ndecide about the preventive measures. A committee of the Members of\nParliament has already been constituted and it has already started\nfunctioning. The Government would follow its advice. Let me once again\nassure you that in this country, to the extent it is within the power of the\nGovernment, there will be no place for corruption or corrupt people and no\none would be spared whatever be his or her status. The law will take its\ncourse, no one can escape punishment according to the law. There will be\nno leniency in this regard. I would like to make it clear before you.\n      It is my appeal to you that we need peace for the next two to three\nyears. In our country we have problems that bring the people together and\nthere are also problems which divide the people. It is not possible that for\nthe next two to three years, we declare a moratorium on raising such\nproblems which divide us. These problems will remain, but we should\nforget about them. They may be raised again after sometime when\ncontroversies are resumed. But for the next two to three years, there\nshould be no scope for such conflicts. All the problems are national\nproblems and they affect the entire society. Of course, we attend to the\nproblems which are already on hand. We can put aside new contentious\nproblems. I hope that my appeal for a moratorium would be accepted by\nother parties also. If the people accept it, no one could refuse. It would be\nof immense help to the country.\n      I want to make one more submission. This is my promise: We will not\ntake any hasty decision. Hasty decisions by the Government add later to\nthe difficulties. When the decision is taken in a hurry, it may seem good, but\nadverse consequences have to be faced later and add to the\ncomplications. Therefore, we would not do anything in a hurry. We will do\neverything after careful consideration. But every step we take, will be firm\nand once we move ahead, we will not retreat. Our approach will not be\npartisan approach. Our vision would be a vision for the good of the entire\ncountry and entire society. This is the approach that we want to follow.\n      I would appeal to you to give a serious thought to these three points. I\nwish that if we can develop a national consensus on these three points and\nif we move ahead together, then we shall be able to overcome the\nproblems that we have inherited and not only this, but we would be able to\nmake tremendous progress in taking the country ahead so that we may\ncome up on par with other countries. If this does not happen because of\nour involvement in petty problems, we will remain backward. I want to\nsubmit very humbly that you must ponder over these aspects. If you all give\nyour blessings to these three principles (Sutras), no one can dare oppose\nthem. I want the blessings of my countrymen and their support for these\nthree points which I am sure I will receive.\n      I have taken enough time. Yet, there are many things that I wanted to\nshare with you, but I will have other occasions for that. Today, on this\noccasion, we have to move towards a future that is full of hope. There have\nbeen many happy developments and there have been less happy things\ntoo. They have to be dealt with. On the whole, the future appears to be full\nof hope and I call upon you and invite you to march forward towards that\nfuture and I seek the blessings of all of you."},{"year":1991,"pm":"P.V.

Narasimha Rao, selected speeches, Vol 1","text":"I offer my hearty greetings to you on the auspicious occasion of the\nforty-fourth anniversary of the Independence Day of our country. It is a\ntribute to democracy that an ordinary worker like me, born in a small\nvillage, is able to address you from the ramparts of this historic Red Fort. It\nis due to your blessings and my good fortune.\n      You are aware that numerous people made sacrifices for this\nfreedom and nurtured it with their blood. The great chariot of democracy\nhas been moving forward steadily and shall keep going ahead.\n      During the last 44 years, elections were held for the Lok Sabha ten\ntimes. The Tenth General Elections were held only recently. During these\nelections, your anger as well as your appreciation have found expression.\nWe have accepted with humility the mandate given by you. We belong to\nyou, we are from amongst you and will continue to be a part of you. These\nare our credentials, and we do not need any other identity.\n       The elections for Tenth Lok Sabha were held in the shadow of a\ntragedy. Rajiv Gandhi's brutal assassination had stunned the country. The\nsudden disappearance of a young man, who was perceived to have solved\nthe problem of leadership of our country for the next 20 to 25 years,\nplunged us all into darkness. But what can be done? We know that\neveryone who is born is destined to die one day. If death occurs after a full\nlife, we accept it, but an untimely death causes distress. We will implement\nthe agenda that Rajivji had prepared for the future of the country. And I\nstand before you with the resolve to follow the path shown by him.\n       I want to apprise you of the critical phase that the country is passing\nthrough today. This Government has completed 55 days in office. During\nthis period we have taken certain decisions and avoided certain pitfalls.\nThe people gave us the mandate to form the Government but it was short\nof the necessary majority. We accepted the mandate of the people and\nformed the Government. We will not spare any effort to ensure that the\ncountry marches ahead towards progress. The co-operation extended to us\nby other political parties has made the situation optimistic. It is my first\nbelief that there is no reason to entertain any doubt about the stability of\nthis Government.\n     Very briefly I want to place before you the situation inherited by this\nGovernment. We inherited a situation which was vitiated by\nfundamentalism, hatred among castes and social unrest.\n       The economy was in the grip of a serious crisis that was\nunprecedented in the history of free India. Our financial credibility had\ntouched the nadir. In a week or two, we would have been unable to repay\nour loans. I assumed the office in such a situation. Many of the problems\nwere there for a long time, but during the last two years they grew in their\ncomplexity. This was part of our legacy. Things appeared to go out of hand.\nThere was no scope for delay, and procrastination would have been\nsuicidal. Therefore, we had to undertake certain prompt measures. We took\nbold decisions. We have been able to arrest the deterioration which was\ncreeping in. A lot more has got to be done, but certainly we have arrested\nthe situation from deteriorating further.\n      You are all aware that we produce so many things in the country for\nour requirements. But there are some items that we still have to import.\nThere are some commodities which we produce, but the quality we\nproduce is not enough to meet our needs. Therefore, we have to import\ncommodities like kerosene oil, diesel, edible oil, fertilizers, etc. To import\nthese we need foreign exchange as the Rupee is not convertible abroad.\nOur foreign exchange reserves have been woefully depleted. Even today\nwe are not in a comfortable position and therefore we will have to boost our\nexports. The goods that we produce will be exported and we will get foreign\nexchange in return. Therefore, first of all, we have done away with the\nsystem of licences, permits etc. as this complex system created many\nobstacles for the people. Now we have broken this vicious circle, and\nliberated those who were stuck in it.\n      We have paved the way for increasing our exports by slightly\nchanging the exchange rate of the Rupee. We trust that in the coming days\nour exports would get a boost and we would be able to earn enough foreign\nexchange. We have presented our new budget in which we have\nformulated a number of schemes for public welfare, especially keeping in\nview the needs of our population.\n      I want to give a brief account of some of these programmes. We have\ndone a lot but I would like to discuss a few of them as there is not enough\ntime for a detailed presentation. As you know, we have prepared an\nextensive programme in the memory of Rajivji ​which aims at ​providing\ndrinking water to every village in the country. You know that drinking water\nhas been provided to a number of villages during the last forty years. Yet\nthere are a few far-flung villages where there is a scarcity of drinking water.\nTherefore we are taking up 80,000 such villages in which drinking water will\nbe made available under the programme named after Rajivji.\n      We have to improve the lot of our backward classes. To help them we\nare setting up a corporation.\n      We know that occasionally communal riots occur in our country. In\nthese riots many people get killed, some become crippled and many\nchildren are rendered orphans with none to look after them. For these\nchildren we have set up a National Fund. This fund would be utilised to\neducate and bring up such children so that they get all opportunities to\ngrow as worthy citizens of this country.\n      In our country, at times, the workers lose their jobs. Once they\nbecome jobless, none cares for them. We have formulated a plan to help\nthem and rehabilitate them in alternative vocations by giving them training\nso that they do not become unemployed.\n       You know that our villages have got gifted craftsmen. They are\nsecond to none in their skills but their tools are outmoded. There are nearly\n5.5 lakh villages in this country. Now, you can imagine how many\ncraftsmen are there in every village working with outmoded tools. We have\nprepared a scheme to provide modern tools for all such craftsmen so that\nthey do not migrate from villages to cities. By using better tools they can\nearn much more in the villages. Such migration creates problems in the\ncities. Therefore, once better tools are made available to them the\ncraftsmen will have no compulsion to rush to cities and they can enhance\ntheir income by remaining in the villages.\n       The most important thing is our Public Distribution System under\nwhich we have fair price shops, which are now largely concentrated in\ncities. The Public Distribution System has not yet reached the villages. We\nhave decided to take up 1500 blocks in far-flung tribal, desert and very\nbackward areas to provide at least one fair price shop in each village. In\nthese shops people can get the commodities of their daily consumption at a\nreasonable rate. This would be a big boon for the people living in our\nvillages.\n       You must also be aware that there are frequent land disputes and\noften they assume such violent proportions that the real issues are pushed\ninto the background. And a lot of litigation continues for years, ruining the\npeople. The source of these conflicts are the land records which are not\nkept properly. The only method to avoid this is to keep our land records in\nthe villages properly so that people know about their ownership and\nproprietary rights. We want to launch this campaign throughout the country\nso that in every village proper land records are made available.\n      Rajivji had given us Indira Mahila Yojana but during the last two\nyears, there has been no implementation of this scheme. We will revive\nand implement it. You know that the Panchayati Raj Bill was not allowed to\ntake the shape of law. We will now have it passed and implement it.\n      I want to impress upon our non-resident Indian brothers that we want\nto welcome them here. We want to offer them many facilities here. We are\nready to offer whatever facilities they require for making investments and\nset up industries. We want to strengthen the age-old bonds. We are proud\nof them. Lakhs of Indians have gone abroad. They have become\nprosperous. Even today they are determined to serve their country. Once\nagain I extend to them a very cordial welcome.\n     Now I want to speak to you about certain burning problems before the\ncountry. As I mentioned earlier, the feeling of hatred is rampant. There is a\nspate of violence. We have to change this in this country, which is the\nabode of non-violence. There is no place for violence here. India, which\nbelieves in world peace, will have no right to talk about it, unless there is\npeace in the country.\n      There are then the problems of Punjab and Kashmir. In these states\nviolence, separatism and terrorism are prevalent. I want to make it clear\nthat none is going to gain out of terrorism. The only result is bloodshed and\nloss of lives. Those who are indulging in such activities will never be able to\nachieve their aims. We should return to the path of peace and I appeal to\nthem that they should co-operate with us in evolving a solution to the\nproblems of this country, problems of Punjab and problems of Kashmir.\nTogether we can find the solutions. There is no problem which is\ninsurmountable.\n      We surely want elections in Punjab, but we would not tolerate the use\nof elections to promote separatism. We will ensure that elections are held\nwithin the parameters of the Constitution.\n       About Kashmir, I want to assert we are confident of facing the\nsituation there. We will contain terrorism. As far as Kashmir is concerned\nthere is the Shimla Agreement between India and Pakistan, and we will try\nto resolve the problems according to that agreement. This has been our\nendeavour so far and the same holds good for the future. We do not\nrequire any mediation. We are neighbouring countries and we will solve our\nproblems between ourselves. All the problems can be solved, if there is\nunderstanding on the other side and if the activities of abetting and aiding\nviolence are stopped from that side.\n       During the last two or three years a strange dispute has cropped up\nover the mosque and the temple. The foundation of our country is\nsecularism. It is neither anti-religion nor fanning communalism in the name\nof religion. We wish to remain secular. Religion is a personal affair. The\nGovernment, its policies and programmes have got nothing to do whether\nsomeone visits the temple or someone else goes to the mosque. We are\nnot going to give up secularism. We may need the help of others for\nrunning the Government, but we cannot take this country ahead if we give\nup the basic principles. This country will disintegrate the day we give up\nsecularism. Therefore, we must stick to it. Religion binds people. It\ngenerates spiritual thinking and improves our material and spiritual well\nbeing. The use of religion in politics to secure votes in elections is certainly\nnot desirable. I hope people will understand this and will not allow such\ndesigns to succeed.\n      By secularism we also believe that minorities should be given full\nprotection and therefore we are going to give legal status to the Minorities\nCommission. There is no danger to any religion here. I must say that the\nslogans about this or that religion being in danger are absolutely bogus. In\nthis country there has never been any threat to any religion nor will there\never be. We want to guarantee this. It is the firm resolve of this\nGovernment that there should be no threat to any religion; and if a threat\nwas ever there, we would eliminate it. This danger will never be there. We\nhave to guard against such slogans.\n      We then have the issue of Mandal Commission which relates to our\npeople belonging to the backward castes and backward classes. We\ncertainly want social justice. We have undertaken several programmes to\nachieve this. In many States these programmes are continuing but we do\nnot want social disintegration to attain social justice. We do not want the\nachievement of social justice by violence or by creating mutual\nconfrontation. This cannot happen. It would lead to many other afflictions.\nWe have faith that we can solve this problem peacefully and by consensus.\nI have discussed this with many people. I feel that on this issue, there is\nconsensus to a large extent. Though the process is not yet complete, a\nbroad consensus can be arrived at. I wish that this issue be resolved on the\nbasis of a national consensus. Our efforts in this direction will continue.\n      Our farmers give us food and for them an extensive programme is\nbefore us. The farmers produce foodgrains but the production of several\ncommodities will have to be stepped up so that we can export them to earn\nforeign exchange. I invite our farmers who have provided food for us to\ncome forward now to produce for export and make this country prosperous.\n      I would like to tell our armed forces that the Government is always\nalive to their interests and their welfare and there are several schemes\nbefore us. For want of time I cannot outline them but I want to assure them\nthat we are preparing many schemes for them and we shall always be\nready to look after their interests.\n      Friends, today the main problem before the country is economic. We\nhave to increase our production as well as the wealth of this country. If\nwealth does not increase there will be nothing to distribute and it is not\nprudent to distribute poverty. Therefore, the need of the hour is that we\nshould add to our wealth and ensure its just distribution. For this we have\nformulated a programme and the Government is keeping both these\naspects in view. We have to generate employment and for increasing\nemployment opportunities industrialisation is needed. The industry cannot\nremain outdated. A new environment has got to be created. We are\nengaged in this. If the capacity of industry does not develop, it will lag\nbehind and we shall not be able to compete in the world market. Therefore,\nthe capacity of the industry has got to be developed.\n      Besides tackling the economic issue, we must also ensure that there\nis no disintegration. Social unrest should not be there and people should\nnot waste their energy and time fighting each other. I want to impress upon\nyou that this has got to be stopped at any cost. Social unity and national\nunity are not separate from each other. Both are two sides of the same coin\nand therefore we have to take care of them.\n     I think that it is our foremost duty to uphold national unity, social unity\nand maintain social equilibrium so that there is no setback to social\nharmony. To achieve this we will continue to make all out efforts and, as I\nhave said, this is the duty of all of us and we should perform this sincerely.\n      There are many things that I wanted to discuss with you but there is\nnot enough time. But I will keep in touch with you and inform you about the\nvarious programmes and the steps that we propose to take from time to\ntime. Today I would only like to say that the country is at a very precarious\njuncture and there are many dangers, both internal and external, looming\nlarge on the horizon. To face them we need unity. Once again I offer my\ngreetings to you on this auspicious occasion. I offer my best wishes for a\nvery happy year of India's Independence to all of you. May this country\nscale new heights of progress in the coming year. I am grateful to all of you\nfor giving me a patient hearing and I hope that you will fulfil your duties and\nwill help the Government in performing its duties. You and me are not\nseparate. We have to work together. Let us march ahead hand in hand."},{"year":1990,"pm":"V.P.

Singh, Selected Speeches and Writings, 1989-90","text":"Today, on the occasion of Independence Day, I offer my hearty\ngreetings to you. History took a turn about 43 years ago and Pandit\nJawaharlal Nehru hoisted the beautiful tricolour of independent India at this\nvery place raising waves of hopes among crores of people. This flag of\nours symbolises our struggle, our resolve and our strength. On this\noccasion, we express our respect to the freedom fighters and offer our\ntribute to martyrs. Entire nation bows its head in honour of their memory.\n       In fact a country, where memorials to the martyrs are in shambles,\ngets ruined. We, therefore, remember our martyrs, freedom fighters who\nhave strengthened our nation. Today, we remember Bapu, Pandit\nJawaharlal Nehru, Jayaprakash Narayan, Sardar Patel, Maulana Azad,\nSardar Bhagat Singh, Subhas Chandra Bose. The names of martyrs and\nfreedom fighters are legion and it is not possible to recount all those\nnames. I also want to recall those names which never found a mention in\nnewspapers and nobody knows about them but who sacrificed themselves\nto win independence for the country. We also remember them today. I\nrecall those days when the British showered bullets, but those were the\ndays of freedom struggle. The British ran short of bullets but the number of\nfreedom fighters prepared to brave the bullets ever declined. We got our\nindependence after much sacrifice.\n      Today is not only a historic day, but the place also is historic. Delhi\nhas been a witness to a procession of history. Kurukshetra is not far off\nwhere Lord Krishna gave a clarion call for the Mahabharata and gave his\nmessages of the Gita. There is Panipat whose memory still reverberates\nwith clinking of swords. We can still see afresh the old grandeur if we just\nscratch these stones of Red Fort.\n      Chandni Chowk has witnessed the rise and fall of many emperors.\nOurs is a long history. Even after independence, there is no reduction in\nour ordeals. The country has passed through difficult times. But the great\npeople of this land have emerged with greater strength from each ordeal.\nWe passed through periods of war and national calamities. We have also\nwitnessed transfer of power in a democratic manner. From all these trials\nand ordeals, one aspect has come out prominently, that democracy has\ntaken firm roots here and there is no one who can shake it. People have\nalways kept the respect and honour of the country high and herein lies our\ngreater strength.\n      The country today is faced with dual challenges. On the one hand,\nthere is separatism and on the other, violence. Separatism is posing a\nchallenge for the country's unity and violence is a challenge to democracy.\nThey pose a challenge to the history of our entire freedom struggle. They\nare challenges to our political and social values and to our system. It is not\na challenge to a party or a class but to the entire system. Jammu and\nKashmir, Punjab, Assam are names of different places. Their problems\nmay also be different. But so far as the challenges of violence and\nseparatism are concerned it is the same everywhere. We must, therefore,\nface them unitedly. Divided they cannot be faced and it had been our\nendeavour to unitedly face them. My heart goes to the people of Jammu\nand Kashmir for they participated in the freedom struggle. Similarly I feel for\nthe people of Punjab for they shed blood for the achievement of freedom.\nWe find the blood marks of both Hindus and Sikhs in Jallianwala Bagh.\n       Assam had been our most peaceful State and a solution to its\nproblem will be found by the people there. I want to tell the people of\nKashmir that secularism has been the symbol of our freedom. Not only the\nvalley of Kashmir or Assam but the entire country belongs to them. If we\nhave committed certain mistakes, we are prepared to amend them for they\nare our own people. If under the influence of misguided propaganda by\nanother country, they think about secession, they should recall the tragic\nepisodes following the independence when lakhs of people migrated to a\nneighbouring country where they are still called Muhajirs. They have not\nbeen accepted in that country and are subjected to bullets. Therefore,\nthose living in Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab and Assam should not think\nthat they are alone. Entire India with all its power is prepared to fight\nagainst their problems, their difficulties and their woes. They are partners in\nthe prosperity of the country, I am confident that a day will come when our\nmisguided youth will realise this and will have equal role in making India a\ngreat nation.\n      Soon after this Government assumed office, we went to Harmandar\nSahib to offer our obeisance. We also visited the Durgiana Temple. We\nwent to the martyrs' memorial at Jallianwala Bagh and prayed for peace in\nPunjab.\n       But peace has not so far come to Punjab. However, there was a\npurpose behind visiting those places. An atmosphere had been created in\nthe country in which every Sikh was looked at with suspicion. Their self\nrespect had been hurt. It was to honour them. to show our trust in them, to\ntell them that the country recognises with gratitude the sacrifice they have\nmade for the country and for the freedom, for the success of the green\nrevolution, for industrial advancement. Now an atmosphere has been\ncreated where there is no air of suspicion and a sense of trust has been\ngenerated.\n      The violence, of course, has increased and this is a matter of concern\nfor us. We have done a lot during this period so as to assuage the hurt\nfeelings of our Sikh brothers. For this, we have rescinded the 59th\nAmendment which was brought about for Punjab. We have released many\ninnocents who were in jails. Those who left the Army for some reason were\nalso released from the jails. Courts have been set up for 1984 Delhi riots\nvictims. It was not done with the intention of bargaining. It was a confidence\nbuilding effort. For I believe that the people of Punjab want peace, want to\nstay with India, and it would be unjust to club the people of Punjab with\nseparatists. We will never do so. We have unflinching faith in the people of\nPunjab.\n     However, on this occasion we will also have to see who is with India\nand who is not with India. We cannot have any compromise with forces\nwhich are not with India. We may lose everything but there cannot be any\ncompromise with the integrity of India.\n      Our policy is clear. We will win the people of Punjab with love but will\nwin anti-national elements through force. We will use both love and arms.\n        Today on the occasion of Independence Day, we have to resolve to\nfight another freedom struggle. The struggle is under way and before us.\nWe have to join it. One generation gave us this flag. Our responsibility is to\nkeep the flag flying. Our Armed forces, our Police forces are bravely facing\nthe challenges, but it is the duty not only of the Army to die for the country\nbut of every citizen. Only that country has survived where the citizens have\nrisen to the occasion. Whether it is Vietnam or Leningrad, the country has\nsaved itself when the people have stood up. Today we need the same\nspirit. If the 80 crore people and youth of the country stand up, we can put\nup a human wall on our borders. Then who can dare to cross our borders.\nWe do not have enough resources to pay salaries and raise the number of\nthe Army to the level required. We are proud of the sacrifices made by our\nArmed Forces. But what we have to consider now is whether Mahatma\nGandhi fought for the freedom by paying salaries to the freedom fighters.\nHe asked people to make sacrifices for the country and the entire country\nresponded.\n      We desire that the Jawans defend the nation even though we may\nhave a fistful of grams. It is not the riches that have saved the country but\npledges and sacrifices that saved it. All of us whether those who are sitting\nin the ramparts or on the grounds will have to join together to face the\ndanger on our border. Crossing of borders with arms, we will have to\nmentally prepare ourselves. On the occasion of Independence Day, we\nremind ourselves of need for vigilance by people. The people should come\nforward and I am ready to go with them. It is better to die on the borders\nthan to watch border violations take place sitting in Delhi. Today the\ncountry demands sacrifice. We must prepare ourselves for this sacrifice by\nremembering our martyrs. The fight is to be waged not in the secretariat or\nin the North or South Blocks. It has to be carried to the fields of granaries.\nThe people will rise in the streets. Eighty crore people with hundred sixty\ncrore hands will rise together and the country will be invincible. No one can\nthreaten us. But the heart of 80 crore people beat with those of the people\nof Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir and they are not different from the rest\nof the people of the country.\n      We are prepared to make the same sacrifice to protect and to see\nthat no injustice is done to them. We want to establish there an atmosphere\nof peace and justice.\n       Along with other problems there is yet another major challenge which\nI mentioned about on the very first day, and that is Ram\nJanmabhoomi-Babri Masjid controversy. It is our endeavour to solve this\nproblem by mutual understanding amicably, because that is the only\nmethod to solve our problems. But I would like to say that the greatest\ntemple or mosque is the heart of the human being and if the heart is\nbroken, there shall neither be a temple nor a mosque. The only abode of\nGod is the conscience and the heart of the human being. In this context, all\nour efforts are aimed at finding an amicable solution to this problem. But\nalong with that we have to uphold the dignity of the courts. We have got\ndifferent religions, different faiths, different languages and people of\ndifferent regions. Though we have our own faith, we don't want to hurt\nanyone because we have to respect the faith of everyone. But if there are\ndifferences among them, then we have to respect the verdict of the higher\ncourt as the judiciary is above the Government. However, there is still hope\nthat we shall find a way out.\n       Today the people are affected by rising prices. We are concerned, as\nthe price rise hurts poor people like labourers, rickshaw-pullers, porters\nmost. We are trying to cope with the economic conditions and inflation for\nsometime. There is also the budget deficit. We are trying to overcome\nthese problems. It will take sometime to bring the situation under control.\nWe want to make it clear that we will take stern action against those trying\nto exploit people's difficulties for profiteering. There shall be no slackness\non this front. It is a fact that higher prices paid by us to the farmers for\nsugarcane, wheat and rice had, to some extent, contributed towards the\nincrease in prices of a few commodities. But those people who toil in the\nfields have got their share in the overall prosperity of the country. The most\ndifficult situation is that of edible oils. The main reason for this is that\nproduction was less by 10 lakh tonnes and therefore, there is a problem\nthis year. There has been good rainfall everywhere and this would have a\nsalutary effect on prices. This is a God's gift. But the Saurashtra region,\nwhich is known for its groundnut production did not have the desired rainfall\neven this year. I pray today that clouds must go to Saurashtra and shower\nrains there, so that they may give substantial relief to us. As far as the\nsudden spurt in the prices of petrol, diesel and other petroleum products is\nconcerned, this problem has been caused by the Middle East situation. If\nthe price of crude oil goes up even by $1, then the import bill of crude oil\ngoes up by 400 crore.\n      We have to pay Rs 400 crore more in foreign exchange. That is how\nour foreign exchange burden has increased from Rs 1600 crore to Rs 2000\ncrore within the recent few weeks. I want to pose this question before my\ncountrymen, there is an easy option that we take loans from outside to\nimport oil. Some quantity will anyway have to be imported. By taking a loan\nto cover the entire import of oil, the prices could certainly be brought down.\nThis will please you, the popularity of the Government will increase and\nperhaps my continuance in power will also be more certain. But would you\nlike me to compromise with the long-term interests of the country to make\nmy position stronger? This would certainly make the people happy, but this\nwould not be in public interest. This will be like a doctor prescribing sweets\nto a patient of diabetes, simply for the fear that if he doesn't do so the\npatient would reject him and he would lose his fees. That doctor would\ncertainly make the patient happy, but he would also drive the patient to his\ndeath. Every political leader should have the courage and spirit of sacrifice\nto present the complete picture and facts before the people to lead them on\nthe path which is in public interest. I have full faith that once the people\nknow the real difficulties, they would be willing to make sacrifices and I am\nsure that is the farmers get remunerative prices for a year or two, they will\nraise bumper crops of oilseeds which will not only meet our internal\nrequirement, but also enable us to export. I would appeal to you to have\npatience. But if anybody indulges in exploiting the difficulties of the people\nas regards other commodities, they would be dealt with firmly. There shall\nbe no let up in this. Along with this, I want to repeat from this platform the\nsame sentence that I spoke while addressing the nation for the first time. At\nthat time I said that we have come into power with trust from the villages\nand bylanes and we have to uphold the sanctity of the soil and in the last\nfew months we have tried to do that. We had promised that 50 per cent of\nthe resources would be invested in the villages and the Eighth Five Year\nPlan is being formulated on this very basis. It is provided in this year's\nBudget that two-thirds of the debt relief given to the farmers, labourers,\nweavers and artisans will be met by the Central Government. As soon as\nthis Government came into power, I ordered that principles should be laid\ndown to fix prices to be given to farmers for their produce in a manner that\njustice is done to them.\n      The farmers got better prices for wheat and rice. Howsoever, much\nwe may attempt to give benefit to the farmers through the Budget, it does\nnot reach the poor, like the canal water which is diverted, does not reach\nthe poor at the other end. By fixing higher prices we have been able to\nensure that these resources amounting to thousands and crores of rupees\nreach the farmers without any interruption.\n      Today, we have five deficiencies in the agricultural system. We want\nto remove them. One is that the per capita national production has gone\ndown in rural areas. The production has gone up, but the per capita\nproduction has decreased because the population of the villages has\nremained same as its percentage in total national production has come\ndown. There was no balance in the price that farmer secured for his\nproduce and the price he had to pay for his purchases. The balance was\nagainst him. The third deficiency is that our green revolution was confined\nmainly to a few foodgrains. It was mainly for wheat, but oilseeds and pulses\nremained outside the purview of this revolution. This imbalance has to be\ncorrected. The green revolution did not cover all the areas and only few\nregions drew benefit out of it. What is causing maximum concern is that\ncapital investment in agriculture has become almost stagnant. If we take\nthe price rise into account the farmers did not get fair prices. Keeping all\nthese problems in view, we shall announce a national agricultural policy\nthis year. This resolution will earmark the complete agricultural policy. The\nIndustrial Policy was declared in 1956, but in this country where agriculture\nis the backbone of the economy, agricultural policy was never declared.\nTherefore, we want to announce a national agricultural resolution so that\nfuture governments are bound by it. We shall be bound by it; succeeding\ngovernments should also abide by it so that the villages continue to\nprosper. In this connection we are reminded of the slogan 'Jai Jawan, Jai\nKisan' given by Lal Bahadur Shastri. We shall march ahead by making Jai\nJawan or Jai Kisan as our aim and the next decade of the 90s would be\nobserved as the farmers' decade. During this decade, we will undo the\ninjustice which has been done to the farmers during the previous decades.\nThe decade of the 90s would be a decade of the farmers as agriculture is\nthe nation's first industry. A doubt was expressed whether agriculture is an\nindustry or not. I believe that agriculture is the foremost industry of our\nnation. Without this industry other industries cannot be sustained. But there\nare many ifs and buts in this and during this decade we want to remove\nthem. This cannot be accomplished overnight but we shall strive with all our\nstrength to achieve this. There are many hindrances in the trade of the\nfarmer and we shall remove them. He should be free to sell his produce\nanywhere in the country and there should be no restriction on this If there is\nany restriction, that should be done away with. All these limitations should\nbe removed. There are restrictions on its export. They cannot be removed\naltogether but we should endeavour to remove them. We have waived the\nloans given to the farmers once, but it is not possible to do so every time.\nWe should find ways to make resources available to them so that they don't\nslide into debts.\n       Irrigation and power are two main inputs. During the Kisan decade\nour effort would be to provide maximum resources to these two sectors.\nWe also want to dovetail agro-industries with agriculture, because if there\nare agro-industries in the villages there will be no exodus of population to\nthe cities. In the formulation of the Eighth Five Year Plan, the generation of\nemployment is our main aim and this is done in order to provide\nnon-farming employment to youth in the villages. We are conscious of the\nfact that if the country is to be strengthened, industry also will have to be\nstrengthened and we cannot ignore it. Industry cannot be strong without a\nstrong base. It will be our endeavour to make this base strong. We shall\npay special attention towards export promotion. Small-scale industries\nrequire special attention. Red tapism has tied down the potential of industry\nand therefore, we have to cut this red tape so that the productive forces get\nan impetus. We are happy that demands are being made to give\nimportance to the poor.\n       In my first address to the nation, I had asserted that if our\nGovernment is a sword it will be wielded to secure justice for the poor and\non this auspicious occasion I want to reaffirm that assertion. The place of\npoor in the present system where there is a nexus between capital and\npower-centres is not new, this struggle has been continuing for centuries.\nWe know the emperors who occupied the throne in Red Fort, but the\ncraftsmen who built this magnificent building remain unknown. The statue\nin a temple is carved out by a sculptor but when it is installed in a temple,\npeople know only about the King in whose period the temple was made\nand that sculptor is not allowed to enter the temple, leave aside any credit\nbeing given to him. It is the offshoot of the same society and system that\nthere was no portrait of Bharat Ratna Babasaheb Dr Bhim Rao Ambedkar\nin the Central Hall of Parliament though he was the architect who gave the\nConstitution to this country. Now we want to ask the question whether we\ncan give any pride of place to the poor in our system. The poor have a\nhand in forming the government through elections but the poor have no\nhand in running the government. Do we have the courage to give a share\nto the poor in running the government. Those who are called depressed\nclasses had lost a political battle thousands of years ago. Till today the\nresult of that political battle has not been reversed. Therefore, it is not the\nquestion of treasury but it is the question of throne. One who occupies the\nthrone will also control the treasury. Gone are the days when we used to\ngive doles to the poor from the treasury. He is not fighting for doles. He has\nbeen poor for thousands of years and may endure to remain like that for a\nfew years more. He is fighting the last battle for his dignity and to live like a\nhuman being. Therefore, we will have to eradicate the system where we\nare always the donors, and the poor remain receivers. This relationship of\ndonors and the receivers will have to be replaced by a feeling of\nbrotherhood. This would be the change in the new system as we have seen\nthat in the name of poverty the poor people have been exploited.\n      Those who professed to remove poverty kept on vanishing poverty\nbut the poor continued to recede to the background. Let the persons\nengaged in eradication of poverty remove themselves and yield their place\nto the poor. The poor would rather get rid of the poverty or be contented\nwith his destiny. I had said in Rajya Sabha that we waste our time in\nmaking small laws for the poor. We should have the courage to pass a law\nin Rajya Sabha, Lok Sabha or Assemblies where decisions are taken to run\nthe country, that if we have 40 per cent poor in our population, we shall\ngive 40 per cent seats in Rajya Sabha, Lok Sabha and the Assemblies to\nthe poor.\n      I am happy that leaders of every party, be it leftist or Bhartiya Janata\nParty or the Congress, welcomed and supported the suggestion.\n      This wide support has enthused us. We want to start this debate\nthroughout the country and today, on the occasion of the Independence\nDay, I want this country to debate this issue. This issue should not only be\ndebated but we should also take a decision and implement it because the\nslogan is: \"Give power and not wealth to the poor and he would bring about\na transformation.\" We believe that no section can be uplifted merely by\nmoney. They can develop only if they have a share in power and we are\nprepared to provide this share. In this year of justice, in memory of Dr Bhim\nRao Ambedkar, the Government has recently taken a decision to give\nreservation to the backward classes in the jobs in government and public\nsectors. It is being debated as to how many persons would get economic\nbenefit out of it. In a sense, taking into account the population of this\ncountry, the government jobs account for only one per cent and out of that\none percent, if one-fourth is given to anyone, it cannot be a course for his\neconomic betterment though it may have some effect. But our outlook is\nclear. Bureaucracy is an important organ of the power structure. It has a\ndecisive role in decision-making. We want to give an effective share in the\npower structure and running of the country to the depressed, downtrodden\nand backward people.\n       Let us have a look at the system. The backward classes constitute 52\nper cent of our population, but in the government jobs its representation is\nonly 14.5 per cent and among the Class I officers, this is only 4.5 per cent.\nHow long will this injustice continue? We shall have to do justice. And when\nwe start doing justice the system gets a jolt and a commotion takes place.\nBut let us search our conscience and leaving aside as to what we can get\nfrom our country, we should think about giving to those who are have-nots.\nThis thinking should mould our life. Only such an approach can bring a\nchange in the lives of people living in huts and toiling masses and this\nwould be the right change. Ministers and ministries change, even Prime\nMinisters change, but the question is as to when the life of people living\nunder thatched roofs will change? That change would be the correct\nchange. To bring about such a change we will have to arouse social forces.\nI call upon the youth to work for this awakening. I invite them to cooperate\nin building a just society because the tear in the eyes of a poor person tear\nfor some time but later it becomes acid. He tears the page of history to\nbuild his own heaven on earth. So long as the tears in the eyes of poor\nkeep the eyes wet, it is alright; but after it gets dried his eyes spit fire. It is\nthe lesson of history that when the eyes of poor turn fiery the palaces of\ngold melt and go down the drain. It is not enough to ponder over; we have\nto act. Therefore, we have made reservation for the backward classes,\ngave statutory status to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes\nCommission and brought forward a law to ensure workers' participation in\nmanagement to protect their rights and to ensure that the labour have a\nshare in the management of the country.\n      Similarly, in Delhi we see the poor people who come from villages\nand live in sewage pipes as they have no roof on their heads. They live on\nthe road side. We intend to enact a law for their settlement. So many\nlabourers come from villages to Delhi and construct palatial buildings here,\nbut they do not have even a hut for themselves. In this context, we are\nreminded of Guru Nanak's saying. He had said that we should rate\neverybody high and nobody should be considered low. This saying will\nbecome the voice of justice. We also have to see that wealth, which is not\ncontributing to the growth of the country, is put to productive purposes. In\nour country an iron plough is more useful than a diamond necklace as a\ndiamond necklace does not contribute to productivity. The iron plough of a\nfarmer, on the other hand, helps us in production. As far as the urban\nproperty is concerned the existing laws have many loopholes and we have\nto remove them. We shall also have to decide whether a single person\nneeds a big bungalow for his accommodation. In a country where even\nhuts are not available, what is the justification of building houses spread\nover acres. This matter should be debated and on this also we will take a\ndecision. Youth are the mainstay of the nation. Theirs is the voice of new\nage. But the biggest problem of the youth is employment. In the Eighth Five\nYear Plan, employment has been given a pivotal importance. We are\ndetermined to fulfil our resolve to give constitutional status to the right to\nwork with the support and cooperation of all the parties. Within the\nresources available for development and our commitments in other fields,\nwe will certainly make a beginning. No government can assure government\njobs to all. But if one is prepared to work, job opportunities should be\navailable. But the problem is that we are more interested in management\nrather than in actual work. Therefore, we want to become managers and\nnot workers. So far as we are concerned, we are not among workers.\nWhen we talk about right to work, we will have to keep in view the social\nparameters according to which a worker should be respected, then only the\nright to work can be really fruitful. You will be happy to know that the\nGovernment has increased budget provision from Rs 20 crore to Rs 265\ncrore for the welfare of youth. This amount will be spent during the current\nyear.\n        Under this provision, the young people who are qualified in different\nprofessions, will be given assistance and loan through the banks to the\ntune of Rs 120 crore for employment. Similarly, provision has been made\nfor Rs 50 crore for giving loans from banks to the poor students who are\nunable to pursue higher studies. In the same manner, for the rural youth a\nsum of Rs 70 crore will be provided under different employment schemes.\nHowever, this is a question of resources. As far as young people are\nconcerned, all the resources of the nation are theirs and they are to inherit\nall the national resources. But the greatest resource are the young people\nthemselves. They are more important than the budget of any country and\nthe government. Therefore, when the young generation is called upon to do\nsomething, it is not for an ordinary task, the call to bring about a complete\ntransformation. Today, I exhort the young people to remove the curse of\nthe illiteracy. If one literate young person imparts the light of knowledge by\nteaching 4 or 5 persons, the entire country will be illuminated by the light of\nknowledge and the darkness of ignorance and illiteracy will be dispelled.\n      Let us make a resolve. If every young person makes such a resolve,\nit would be a great service to the nation. Similarly, there is a question of\npopulation and we have to think about it. The young generation should take\nup a programme to educate and motivate people to limit the size of their\nfamilies. The government also will give all support and facilities. In this\nmanner we can find a solution to a big problem.\n       Women in India have been always enjoying great respect in the\nsociety. But the present social and economic system has pushed them\nbackward. It is not because they lack competence or capability: they are\nalso not wanting in courage but we have tied them down to household\nchores. A nation grows in the lap of women. They bring up the nation,\nnurture our traditions and uphold our culture. But in spite of this great\ncontribution, they have no role in running the country. If we keep a mother\nin chains, there can be no vitality in the nation. How a nation can vibrate\nwith life if women who are the sources of life remain suffocated. Therefore,\nwe have decided to make a beginning by giving them their share in power.\nIn this very session, a bill is being tabled in Parliament to provide for 30 per\ncent seats for women in Panchayati Raj. Along with this the National\nCommission for Justice for Women with Judicial powers will also be set up.\nI hope that all these measures will help us in solving their innumerable\nproblems.\n     On this day, we can't forget our valiant Defence forces: our Army, our\nNavy and our Air force. When we think of them, we feel proud. They have\nalways upheld the dignity of the nation by their sacrifices. When even my\nthoughts go to the Jawans in Siachen, and the Himalayas, I feel that the\nmorale of our Jawans in Slachen is higher than the Himalayas.\n      You will be happy to note that Akash missile which we had been\ndeveloping was successfully launched yesterday. This is a matter of great\npride for us and our scientists. I want to express my gratitude to them.\n      On this occasion we cannot forget our ex-servicemen. The\nGovernment have already taken important decisions about their pension\nand soon it will be placed before the Parliament. But I do not consider\nex-servicemen to be merely pensioners. They are the symbol of our unity.\nWhen they were in uniform they had together taken a vow for sacrifice\nirrespective of the fact whether they were Hindu, Muslim, Sikh or Christian\nor whether they were Tamil speaking, Punjabi speaking, Rajasthani\nspeaking or Bengali speaking. My dear ex-servicemen, you are not only\npensioners, you had provided leadership when you were in uniform. Today,\nwhen you are not in uniform you should provide leadership to the society\nand foster the same sense of unity as you did while you were in uniform.\nThere, all were one. Be it Hindu, Muslim, Sikh or Christian or whatever may\nbe the language, you should remove this feeling wherever you are and you\nshould provide leadership to the society. This emotional unity is our biggest\nstrength and this has not been achieved in a day. It has taken centuries to\nbring about this composite culture embracing different religions and beliefs.\nWe cannot afford to lose this legacy. Any strain on it will also affect the\nnation. The country is not a map on a paper. The map of the nation is in the\nhearts of people of that country. If there are divisive lines in the hearts, they\nwill be reflected on the land also. We would not allow these divisive lines to\nemerge. Here, I want to quote Jan Nisar Akhtar who presents a profile of\nthis culture, \"This country is a synthesis of Hindu and Muslim cultures. This\nsaying is centuries old but this is so fresh even today.\" We have to maintain\nthis freshness.\n      A challenge has come before us. The question is not of poverty but is\nthat of alienation. The human being can tolerate poverty; but he cannot\ntolerate that he should be treated as an alien. The question is not of\nconvenience but is that of participation and we want to involve the\nminorities in the development of the country and in education. Whatever\nmay be our development, be it the case of banks or jobs, justice should be\ndone to the minorities. We want to march towards justice.\n       It has been the demand that in this country we have holiday on the\nbirthday of the propounders of all the religions, but there is no holiday on\nthe birthday of Prophet Mohammad. Today, I want to declare that the\nGovernment has decided that the birthday of Prophet Mohammad will be\nobserved as a holiday. This was the grouse that the facility given to all the\nreligions was denied to a big minority.\n       Today, the relation between Iraq and Kuwait is causing anxiety to us.\nWe do not support violence anywhere in the world, nor do we endorse\nmilitary intervention. Along with this, there should be no unilateral action.\nWe are worried about the life and property of the Indians there. Therefore,\nwe have sent our Cabinet colleague, Shri Arif Mohammad Khan to have a\nfirsthand assessment of the difficulties and problems of Indians there and\nto make arrangements for those who want to come. We are in touch with\ndifferent countries to find out a solution without the use of force or armies.\nOur relations with other countries have generally improved. I have been to\nRussia. President Gorbachev has taken a new initiative in the world and is\nbringing about revolutionary changes in his country. I had an occasion to\nsee them and exchange ideas. My discussions with President Gorbachev\nhave not only strengthened the traditional friendship between India and the\nUSSR but they also helped us in deciding the course we have to follow in\nthe world. Our relations with America have improved. Their stand has come\ncloser to our position on issues of Jammu and Kashmir, plebiscite and\nSimla Agreement. We welcome this With China, exchange of views is\ncontinuing in a positive manner. We have solved the problems with Nepal\nand our good relations with Bhutan, Maldives and Mauritius are being\nmaintained. With Bangladesh also our relations have improved. Tin Bigha\nwas an irritant which has been removed and now the talks on distribution of\nwaters are continuing in an atmosphere of understanding. We are\nconcerned about the Tamils of Indian origin in Sri Lanka and about their life\nand property. For them we have taken an initiative that within Sri Lanka,\nthere should be a camp where they should live securely. The talks are\ncontinuing and I hope, other countries will also be helpful in these efforts.\nBut I will not allow the extremists or militants to use Indian soil as their\ncentre. We want peace, peace in Sri Lanka and peace in India, and will\npursue this policy. While our relations have improved with others, it is\nunfortunate that in spite of our friendly intentions, our relations with\nPakistan have not shown any improvement. All these are before you and\nmuch has been said about them. I do not want to repeat them on this\noccasion, but would like to say two things. We want friendship and if they\nmove one step forward we will reciprocate by moving two steps. But along\nwith this, there should be no compromise on the sovereignty and integrity\nof the country. If there is any evil intention, the whole country would rise\nand face it. We have tried to establish democratic values. In place of\npersonalised politics we are pursuing issue-based politics. If today we are\ngetting support from BJP and Leftist parties it is not for an individual, it is for\nprogrammes.\n      We are getting the support on the basis of issues. There are some\nmaladies in the institutions of this country. We need your support to change\nthis. We have strengthened the foundations of democracy by\ndecentralisation of power, by introducing Panchayati Raj, the Lok Pal Bill,\ngiving autonomy to TV and Radio and setting up the Inter-State Council.\nBut these are institutional changes. Today, our thoughts go to the\ngreatness of India and its past. On this occasion, I pledge that I will not all\nthe dignity of this flag to be sullied. I call upon farmers, workers, young\npeople, women, industrialists, writers, children -- who may not be eligible to\nvote for a change of government but even a child can come forward to save\nthe country - to maintain the dignity of India. This is not an easy path. There\nare many difficulties, but we are brave sons and daughters of a brave India.\nBravery flows in our blood. We cannot be disheartened even if there are\nstorms. Not a thread of this flag can be separated. We will not be terrified\neven if there are thunderstorms or lightning. We will convert this lightning\ninto beacon light for the nation and in this light we will find a way out. On\nthis occasion, I would like you to join me in raising the slogan given by\nSubhas Chandra Bose, at the top of your voice so that the country\nreverberates with its echo from the Himalayas to Kanya Kumari. That\nslogan is: “Jai Hind”."},{"year":1989,"pm":"Rajiv Gandhi","party":"INC","title":"Restoring the old Glory of India","footnote":"Independence Day speech (Hindi) from Red Fort, 15 August 1989","source":"Rajiv Gandhi, Selected Speeches and Writings, Vol 5","text":"My fellow countrymen; Today I want to convey my greetings on\nIndependence Day to everyone from Kanya Kumari to Karakoram and from\nKutch to Arunachal Pradesh and also to all Indians living in different parts\nof the world. India attained Independence 42 years ago and Panditji hoisted\nthe Tri-colour for the first time in Free India.\n       Today, while hoisting the flag, I feel that I am not alone but with me in\nunfurling the flag are, the hands of 80 crore people of India. Ours is a\nhistoric flag. Under this Tri-colour we have fought for our freedom, we have\nmade the country strong and taken it forward. Flag hoisting on\nIndependence Day symbolises freedom of India and freedom of every\nIndian. Today, on the occasion of Independence Day, our thoughts go back\nto lakhs of freedom-fighters, many of whom we do not know, and their\nnames are buried in history. Sacrifices of thousands of them are not\nrecorded in history. To those freedom fighters who are with us today, we\nexpress our gratitude. We are reminded of our freedom fighters whenever\nwe think of independent India. They faced numerous challenges to liberate\nthe country, to strengthen it and take her forward. They made great\nsacrifices and waged a relentless struggle. But, today our thoughts turn\nspecially to Gandhiji, Shastriji and Indiraji. Gandhiji charted a new course\nfor our struggle for freedom, Panditji gave a new direction and led the\nnation on the path of progress. Shastriji and Indiraji faced formidable odds\nin strengthening and protecting the unity and integrity of India.\n      Today, we must also keep in mind that the freedom struggle of India\nwas a unique revolutionary movement. There have been only two or three\nsuch movements earlier in history. One was that of America, the other that\nof France and yet another was that of Russia. Then came the revolutionary\nmovement of India. But while the earlier three movements were marked by\nwaves of violence, India under the leadership of Gandhiji adopted a new\ncourse. During the dark days of servitude, Gandhiji showed us a path\nderived from the heritage of our country. This brought us back to the course\nof our history and culture. India grew strong by that principled approach. On\nthe strength of those very principles we could win Independence, grow\nstrong and preserve our freedom. But what were the principles propounded\nby Gandhiji? They were not new; he only rediscovered them from our\nhistory and culture for us. Foremost amongst them was Ahimsa\n(non-violence). But when Gandhiji talked of Ahimsa, he had a much larger\nperspective in mind. By Ahimsa he did not mean merely the absence of\nviolence; what he meant was that we should not even have a feeling of\nviolence in our hearts which has to be suppressed. He led us on the path of\ntruth, non-violence, tolerance and compassion. He taught us that the\nhistory and heritage of India clearly reflected that humanity was one,\nirrespective of caste, colour, creed, religion, language and region. With\nthese ideals, Gandhiji made us strong. These very ideals which gave us\nstrength, also gave us freedom and enabled us to sustain it.\n       Gandhiji taught us that if India has to develop, if the people of India\nwere to be really free, then this freedom and development have to start\nfrom the village level. Only then can we really claim that we are free.\nGandhiji strove hard but certain capitalist forces did not let him succeed.\nHis hands were tied and development at that time could not start from the\nvillage level.\n      The entire country had great affection for Gandhiji. It is difficult to\ndescribe in words the deep and strong bonds that existed between Gandhiji\nand the people of the country; yet there were a few amongst us who killed\nGandhiji. Gandhiji was assassinated by the communal forces. We must\nunderstand and be clear in our minds that communal forces did not kill\nGandhiji only to eliminate him but to disintegrate the newly independent\ncountry before it got its moorings. However, these designs could not\nsucceed because Gandhiji had given such strength to India that it would\nnever fall or break.\n      After the assassination of Gandhiji, Panditji led India on the road to\ndevelopment and nation-building. He led India to carve out a place for her\nin the world. From the ramparts of this Red Fort, Panditji on numerous\noccasions reminded us about the tryst that the Congress had made with\ndestiny and now after 42 years of Independence we have got an\nopportunity to redeem that pledge. Had Panditji been in our midst today he\nwould have seen how India has built herself up on the foundation that he\nlaid. I am confident that today's India would have filled Panditji's heart with\npride. This is the year of Panditji's Birth Centenary. If he had an opportunity\nto have a look at our progress during the last 42 years, a look at our\nfarmers, our agricultural labourers, our workers, our women, our children,\nour scientists, our youth, our Armed Forces, our industries and our all\nround progress, I am sure he would have felt extremely delighted and\nproud. But he would have noticed a few drawbacks too. He would have\ndiscovered that despite immense progress and development a few\ndeficiencies still persist and our tasks remained incomplete. Panditji had\nreminded us from this very Red Fort of the words of Gandhiji that so long\nas we do not wipe out the tears from the eyes of every Indian, we cannot\nrest. Even today, we have not been able to wipe out the tears from every\neye and therefore there is no time to relax. We have a stupendous task and\na long struggle ahead which calls for great sacrifices.\n       Panditji very much wanted to fulfil Gandhiji's dream of Gramowaraj.\nTo achieve this, he started Panchayati Raj. But he could not complete the\ntask. He could not accomplish this mission because of the infiltration of\npower-brokers who did not allow it to succeed. They ensured that real\npower did not slip out of their hands into the hands of the people of Bharat.\nAfter introducing Panchayati Raj, Panditji did not live long to fight the\npower-brokers to ensure that the power that Gandhiji had wrested from the\nBritish reached the people.\n      Indira Gandhi dedicated her entire life to the poor people and the\nweaker sections of India. She made every effort for the upliftment of the\ndowntrodden. She started with bank nationalisation so that the people of\nIndia could have access to capital. Today we are not facing those\nproblems. We must remember that 20 years ago when the banks were\nnationalised, there was almost no branch of any bank in rural India and the\npoor people were neither getting any help nor did they derive any benefit\nfrom the capital in the banks.\n       Even in Independent India, wealth was only getting circulated among\nthe affluent people. Indiraji changed the scene by nationalising the banks.\nShe invested the funds to alleviate poverty and also for the welfare and\nupliftment of the poor.\n       For the first time, the 20-Point Programme of Indiraji succeeded in\nreducing poverty in India. For the first time, we saw that the benefit of big\nprojects and programmes, started reaching the poor and weaker sections.\nIndiraji devoted her entire life for fighting and eliminating the capitalist\nforces. If there was anything dearer to Indiraji than poverty-alleviation, it\nwas the freedom of India and her unity and integrity. Indiraji spared no\neffort to ensure that India became stronger. She did not take any step\nwhich would have in any way encouraged any element which would\nweaken the country. But Indiraji also had to lay down her life because of\nfissiparous forces. It was yet another attempt to disintegrate India just as by\nkilling Gandhiji an attempt was made to break India.\n       I still remember the critical phase through which India passed when\nIndiraji was assassinated about five years ago. Dark clouds were hovering\nall over the country. There were agitations in different parts threatening to\nbreak the country. After the assassination of Gandhiji, perhaps this was for\nthe first time that India was facing such a crisis. An agitation was continuing\nin Punjab to disintegrate the country. In Tripura, Mizoram and Assam and\nin the hills of Darjeeling also certain developments were taking place. In the\nSouth, because of the developments in Sri Lanka some weaknesses were\nbecoming apparent in our country. Anybody who observed the situation at\nthat time could not have believed that the country would come out of the\ncrisis. All that is now, a thing of the past. At that time, in November, the only\naim bring the country back to the path shown by Gandhiji, Panditji and\nIndiraji, to realise their dreams and the dreams of the people of India.\n     The killers of Indiraji wanted to break India. This conspiracy was not\nhatched in our country, but was conceived abroad and thrust upon us. This\nconspiracy aimed at breaking and destroying our country. The\nassassination of Indiraji was the first step in this direction. The traitors took\nIndiraji away from the people of India. Those traitors snatched away my\nmother from me. I took a vow that I would not let them succeed in their\naims. let them succeed in their aims. We would not allow anyone to\ndismember the country whatever be the price, whatever be the sacrifice we\nmay have to make. My mother Indiraji had taught me that no sacrifice is too\ngreat for the country. Whatever be the difficulties and whatever be the\nsacrifices, we are prepared to make them and are prepared to lay down our\nlives. We have to carry forward the struggle started by Gandhiji, Panditji\nand Indiraji. We have to carry forward the same movement because\nGandhiji's movement was not only to liberate India. It aimed at ushering in\na new era for the people of the world. Gandhiji showed that it was the only\nway to save the world civilisation. Today there is a growing realization in\nthe world that humanity can be saved only through the path shown to us by\nGandhiji and Panditji who for the first time gave new ideologies to the\nworld. For the first time, they impressed upon the super powers that the\nworld cannot move forward and humanity cannot be saved by\npower-blocks. They asserted that a new world-vision is required. This\nvision is of Ahimsa, Truth, Compassion and Tolerance and above all this is\na vision to view humanity as one entity. This was our strength and that is\nhow India has emerged as a strong nation. But in pursuit of this ideal we\nhave had to encounter various forces and face many challenges. At times,\nwe have faced reactionary forces and even today, this confrontation is\ngoing on as the reactionary forces have not been finished.\n       We know how the die-hard elements are active even today in\nencroaching upon the rights of women. We can see for ourselves how\nthese conservative forces, instead of co-operating in the developmental\nprocess of the country, in the service of the people and making the country\nstrong, and protecting its unity and integrity, are busy in singing and\ndancing. India cannot be built in this fashion, and we cannot make it strong\nin this manner. Similarly, the forces are still active in weakening and\nbreaking the country. This is a matter of deep regret. I said earlier that if\nGandhiji, Panditji and Indiraji were alive today they would have been proud\nof the progress India had made but some of our deficiencies would have\ntormented them. Had they seen that the traitors are moving about freely\nand are able to be in our Parliament, had they seen that the traitors could\nsupport the murderers of Indira Gandhi and accept saropas at the citadels\nof these murderers, they would have been pained. It would have distressed\nthem to see how some people amongst us are supporting the resolution\nwhich aimed at weakening and dismembering the country. Gandhiji,\nPanditji and Indiraji would have felt distressed to see how the communal\nforces are becoming active and how politics is being dominated by\ncommunalism. Perhaps it would have pained them most to see that some\npeople have deviated from the path shown to us by Gandhiji and are\nconducting their politics in a different manner. There are people in our\npolitical life who can say goodbye to principles. This is very sad because\nwhen India gave up, her principled path, we moved towards slavery and\nultimately became slaves. We will be facing the same consequences. We\nbecame strong only because we adhered to principles. But today\nunfortunately, opportunism and appeasement are rampant in Indian\npolitics.\n       Very few people are willing to talk about principles. We must\nremember that when anti-national, secessionist and communal forces\njoined hands in an unprincipled manner, India was divided. We must\nremember how this happened. Today, all our energies must be geared up\nto defeat the designs of communal, divisive, anti-national, feudal and\nconservative forces because if they join together, it would mean the division\nof India. The people of India must remember that if they allow these forces\nto unite and grow strong, India will disintegrate, her freedom will be lost and\nIndia would again become a slave. Such opportunism would nullify the\nstruggle which was carried on for years, nay centuries. We will ensure that\nthese forces do not join together and we will fight to eliminate them. Our\nfight would not cease till these forces are banished from India and are\ndestroyed completely. Whatever may be the challenge, howsoever arduous\nbe the struggle and whatever may be the sacrifice; no sacrifice can be too\ngreat to protect India from such elements.\n      A review of the progress achieved during the last four-five years\nwould show that India has made significant strides. Even from the point of\nview of unity and integrity of the country, the darkness that enveloped the\nnation during October-November, 1984 has been dispelled. Today, we see\nthe bright light of development and India is marching ahead with speed.\n       In the intervening period, we had to face severe drought but despite\nthat the momentum of agriculture in India was sustained and the farmers of\nIndia faced the drought with courage and determination. The workers also\nlaboured hard to give impetus to industrial development. But the new\nemphasis that we laid on the 20-Point Programme of Indiraji, and the\nJawahar Rozgar Yojana that we have launched in the Birth Centenary Year\nof Panditji, has also made an impact in removing the poverty and improving\nthe lot of poor people and weaker sections of India.\n       Today, I wish to express my gratitude to the people of India. But for\ntheir hard work this would not have been possible.\n      I wish to thank the farmers who have made us self-reliant in the\nproduction of foodgrains. We want to express our gratitude to the workers\nand agricultural labourers as it is their toil and hard work that has\nindustrialised India.\n       India has emerged as a new power in the world. I am grateful to the\nJawans of the country who have made sacrifices and have valiantly\nprotected the unity and integrity of India and maintained peace in the region\nduring these years. Be it Jawans on the borders or on high snow-clad\nmountain peaks, or be it our sailors with the Navy on the sea, be it in the\nMaldives to help a neighbouring country or be it in Sri Lanka to protect the\nTamils, the Jawans and the officers of the Indian Forces have raised the\nprestige of India and have strengthened India. Similarly, the scientists of\nthe country have also turned India into a new force by reaching new\nfrontiers. Be it the test of the Prithvi missile or the launch of Agni, be it\nbio-technology for the benefit of farmers or development of new drugs, our\nscientists and technologists in different fields have charted new paths to\nremove poverty and unemployment and make India stronger.\n      I also wish to thank our administration because without an efficient\nadministration the unity and integrity of the country cannot be so strong,\npeace and stability cannot be maintained and India could not have carved\nout a place for herself in the world. There may be a few deficiencies and\nweaknesses in our administration but there are many strong points without\nwhich India could not be strong and capable of marching on the road\ntowards development.\n       I wish to thank our businessmen and industrialists as they have\naccelerated the pace of India's industrialisation. I also want to thank our\npublic sector which has made its wholehearted contributions to India's\ndevelopment. I want to specially thank the women of India who have\nemerged as a new force during the last few years and have lent a new\nstrength to India. I want to compliment the youth of India as they have set\nout on a new course to eliminate conservatism. For the first time, the youth\nwill get an opportunity for active participation in India's politics. We have full\nfaith in the youth of India; they have fought during the freedom struggle and\nthey have also protected the frontiers of India. Today we have full\nconfidence that the youth would root out conservatism, feudalism, casteism\nand communalism from the soil of India. This would be the real liberation of\nthe country. I wish to thank the minorities of India who have made\nsignificant contributions in developing and strengthening the country. I am\nspecially grateful to Harijans and the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled\nTribes; without their moving forward India could not have marched ahead.\nHad they not joined together to strengthen the country, it would not have\nbeen possible for us to win freedom and to come out of that dark phase.\n       Your contribution has enabled India to stand with her head high in the\nin the world. We will demonstrate to the world with dignity that one can\nkeep India backward. Now India is moving ahead towards development\nand progress. During these years we have achieved a lot, yet much\nremains to be done. There are several deficiencies. Gandhiji had talked of\nGram Swaraj. Panditji made an attempt to start Panchayati Raj. Today, for\nthe first time, we are transferring power to the people of India by passing\ntwo Bills in the Lok Sabha. For the first time real Swaraj is being\nestablished. It is your own Raj. In spite of this we find that opposition forces\nare creating obstacles. They do not want to strengthen the hands of the\npeople of India. They do not want that the people of India should decide\ntheir own course of development. The power-brokers, the capitalists, the\nconservatives and feudal forces are now coming together. They are joining\nhands to prevent the transfer of real power to the people of India. It is sad\nthat communal forces and traitors also have combined with them. We have\nto face all of them because it is only by facing this challenge that we will be\nable to strengthen the hands of the people of India, give them social justice\nand provide strength to the weaker sections and better their lot. For the first\ntime we are giving power to the weaker sections, women, Scheduled\nCastes and Scheduled Tribes in our polity and democracy by taking special\nsteps to ensure that criminals and anti-social elements do not infiltrate into\nour democracy. For the first time, stern measures have been taken to keep\nthem away from politics and the democratic process. We will complete this\ntask despite all the challenges that we may face. After this we have to\nundertake at least two major tasks in the coming years. The first relates to\njustice.\n       Much has been done in India but one cannot honestly claim that\njustice is available in villages at the grassroots level. There is so much\ndelay and expenditure involved that I think we cannot claim that justice is\nbeing done in the real sense. In the coming years we have to\nsee that justice is done. Just as we are strengthening the Panchayati Raj\ninstitutions to make democracy strong and give impetus to development\nand just as we are strengthening the Nagar Palika institutions to provide\nresources for the development of urban areas of India, we will also take\nsteps to ensure that justice is available. If it requires a change in the\nstructure we are prepared to do that as we are not prepared to deny justice\nto the people.\n     We have the opportunity before us to give India a new personality in\nthe world. Today we have an opportunity to make India as great as she\nwas before her slavery. Before India lost her freedom, people from different\ncorners of the world came to discover her wealth and to acquire\nknowledge. But hundreds of years of slavery have emaciated India. India\ndegenerated and became poor and weak. Today for the first time, we have\nan opportunity to restore India to the same old glorious position. We have\nto remove poverty and injustice from India. We have to make India\nself-reliant. We have to develop India into a great power in the world but\nnot like other great powers who have risen by suppressing others. In\npursuance of the ideals of Gandhiji, Panditji and Indiraji, India will not\nsuppress anyone but would champion the cause of the poor of the world.\nIndia will generate a new spirit that would eliminate groupism and would\nestablish the supremacy of humanity which would save the civilization and\nmake it richer. Today we have an opportunity to make India a great nation.\nLet us take a pledge to make India great and strong and to take it forward. I\nthank you and it is my fervent hope that today on the auspicious occasion\nof Independence Day every Indian will place a hand on his or her heart and\ntake the pledge to make India great and to take it to new heights of glory."},{"year":1988,"pm":"Rajiv Gandhi","party":"INC","title":"Restore India's Glory","footnote":"Free rendering of the address in Hindi from the ramparts of the Red Fort on the occasion of Independence Day, New Delhi, 15 August 1988","source":"Rajiv Gandhi, Selected Speeches and Writings, Vol 4","text":"My congratulations to you on Independence Day today. The monsoon\nhas been very good this year. I want to congratulate all our farmers, farm\nlabourers, brothers and sisters, because after many years we have had\nsuch a monsoon.\n      On this day, we have to think of the future and also look back. On the\none hand, we have to see where we have to take the country, how we have\nto carry our people forward, and on the other hand, we have to ponder over\nthe difficulties we have emerged out of, and how we can improve things in\nfuture.\n       When we look back over the last four years, one thing that we notice\nis the economic improvement in the country. We have to recall that the\nmonsoon was very bad in 1984 and 1985. Then there was drought in 1986\nand last year's drought was the worst in living memory. Yet, the country\nsteadily moved forward.\n       Last year, we fought the drought with all our strength. From Delhi,\nfrom the Centre, we paid early attention to it and initiated strong measures.\nOur effort was to see that as far as the drought was concerned we should\nnot bring politics into it and that our attention should be focussed on the\npeople who were suffering under drought and needed relief. We devoted\nlast year to this and our entire attention was concentrated on those people.\nIndia came out of this drought and the pace of our development did not\nhalt, although it slowed down a bit. We did move forward and with strength.\n      The world was a witness to how India faced the drought and it\nrealised that India had become a strong country capable of facing major\ncalamities. The world also realised that there is nothing that can suppress\nIndia or stop it from forging ahead.\n     I want to congratulate all those who put their shoulders to the job of\nmeeting the challenge of the drought- whether they were in politics,\nadministration or in any voluntary organisation. Above all, I would like to\ncongratulate our farmers and farm labourers who faced the drought with\ndetermination. As I said, even though the country was reeling under\ndrought, its pace of development could not be halted. The country moved\nahead even under those conditions. The performance of our infrastructure\nwas very good. Likewise, the process of industrialisation continued at a fast\npace and we did not allow it to falter.\n      For the first time, the country came out of such a difficult period and\nthe pace of development did not suffer. For the first time, we did not go to\nothers with a begging bowl. That we were able to achieve this is a matter of\ngreat pride. We were able to do it because of the work done by Panditji and\nIndiraji during the last 40 years- the result of which we see today. Even\nwhile passing through difficult times, there was no slackening of attention\nwe devoted the poor. We reinforced our programmes of poverty alleviation,\nprogrammes for women, for development of children and for Scheduled\nCastes and Scheduled Tribes. We worked for the rapid and effective\nimplementation of these programmes. Never before have so much of\nresources been invested in poverty alleviation programmes as had been\ndone during these years.\n       Even so, sometimes certain painful incidents occur. A few days back,\na major incident occurred in Jehanabad. It brought down the prestige of the\nentire country. Our endeavour will be to prevent recurrence of such\nincidents. I am aware that our laws have their lacunae and we are unable\nto take the kind of action we would like to. If need be, we will change the\nlaws to ensure that such incidents are not repeated and that the guilty are\nswiftly and suitably punished. Similarly, we have to ensure that our\nminorities get full opportunity to progress and make their contribution to\nnation building. Our weaker sections also require help and we will provide it\nto them. We have to ensure that the backward classes in our country are\nstrengthened and that they get an opportunity to progress.\n       Our economic position has become strong and, during these years,\nwe have also strengthened the country politically. You may recall how the\ncountry was placed three-and-a-half years ago in November 1984. You will\nrecall that a dark cloud hung over it and the single question that agitated\nthe hearts and minds of the people was- what will happen to the country;\nwill India remain united or disintegrate? Indiraji had been assassinated,\nthere were riots in Delhi, the conditions in Punjab were bad, there w\nagitations in Assam and Mizoram, terrorism stalked Tripura and a new\nagitation had started in the Darjeeling hills of West Bengal. In the south, the\npeople were concerned because of the serious Tamil problem in Sri Lanka.\n       When we look around us today, we find a great improvement. There\nhas been an Accord with Sri Lanka which we hope will soon be fully\nimplemented. Meanwhile, the concern among the people in South India has\nbeen removed. Peace has come to Darjeeling following an agreement.\nThere has been a settlement in Tripura bringing terrorism to an end. Peace\nhas been restored in Mizoram and also in Assam. There have been\nchanges in the Punjab situation though not to the desired extent. When we\ncompare the Punjab of 1984 with the Punjab of 1988, we see the\ndifference. The same old feelings are no longer there. Today the\nadministration is firmly moving ahead together with the people of Punjab\nwho have stood up firmly for the country and everyone in Punjab is\ndeterminedly facing the challenge of extremism and terrorism.\n       We have demonstrated that if we want we can act firmly and show a\nfirm hand. The Operation \"Black Thunder\" showed to all of us and to the\nwhole world that India's security forces can act firmly and with great\ndiscipline. It also proved that the terrorists are mere terrorists and that\nreligion finds no place in their hearts. The kind of things they did in that holy\nplace, have perhaps never before been indulged in in any sacred place in\nthe country. We had never witnessed such desecration of a holy place and,\nI hope, we never have to see such a thing in future.\n      We are taking swift action to secure our borders to prevent infiltration\nand control terrorists. We regret that terrorists are still getting help from\nacross the border. We hope that those helping the terrorists will soon\nrealise the seriousness of their mistake. We would not like to take any\naction that may force them to repent later.\n      During these years, we have totally changed the country's spirit. The\ndepressing dark clouds of 1984 prevail no more. Today, people find a\nstrong country forging steadily ahead with pride. Today, no one raises the\nquestion of disintegration of the country because India has proved to the\nworld that it is a power which cannot be weakened by anyone.\n       But, there is a weakness which we have to completely eliminate. We\nhave to destroy the communal forces. We have to ensure that secularism is\nstrengthened and that no one mixes religion with politics. If a law is\nrequired or any other action is called for, we will do that. But we will fight\nthe communal forces with all our strength. Our endeavour will be to unite all\nthose who want to fight communalism and carry them together to fight\nthese forces. It is our constant endeavour that the spirit of amity among\nreligions prevailing in India, is not only maintained but strengthened.\n       We have also given a great deal of attention to India's security.\nToday, our armed forces are stronger than ever before. We are today\ncapable of facing aggression from any side. This was never the case\nearlier. We have provided a great deal of impetus to defence research and\ndevelopment and to technology and science. For the first time, our defence\ntechnology has forged ahead and is now comparable to that of the\nadvanced countries. In many areas we are on a level with them and we\nhope that in the coming years we will strongly move ahead in this direction\nand show to the world that India can fully stand on its own feet and can\ntotally face any challenge. No one can deviate us from our path.\n       On this day, I would like to congratulate my brothers and sisters in the\narmed forces for their discipline, their perseverance and for their\ndetermination. It is due to their strength that we sleep peacefully every\nnight.\n      In the same manner, we have taken the prestige of India to great\nheights in the world during these years. We desire friendship with all. We\ndesire that the whole world is enveloped in the spirit of humanism and unity\nso that we are able to devote ourselves to poverty alleviation and to\nimproving the lot of the weaker sections.\n      We wish that the ideals of Mahatma Gandhi- the ideals of ahimsa and\ntolerance- spread throughout the world. We have made every endeavour to\npropagate these principles to every corner of the world. Through the\nNon-aligned Movement, we have carried this spirit to 101 nations of the\nworld. We have moved even farther to carry this spirit even to those\ncountries which did not subscribe to these principles. These principles have\nalso made an impact on the great powers. We hope to move ahead on this\npath with greater determination and create in the world a new environment\nof peace, tolerance, unity of mankind and progress. This was the path\nshown to us by Pt. Nehru and by Indiraji. We will not deviate from this path\nand will move ahead with determination.\n       We desire friendship with all our neighbouring countries. We wish that\nall of us co-operate to work for the development of our peoples. We\ninitiated this co-operation through the SAARC and the movement has\nprogressed well. There are still many problems and the path is not easy,\nbut the difficulties are not of our making. We have friendship in our hearts\nand we have tolerance. We want our region to be strong, and we will strive\nhard to this end.\n      In our neighbourhood, a conflict has been going on in Afghanistan.\nWe are happy that an agreement has been reached and that peace will be\nrestored there. It is, however. essential that the Agreement reached in\nGeneva is implemented and that there is no deviation from it. If the\nAgreement fails, it will lead to the weakening of the entire region. We hope\nthat all the concerned parties will observe the Geneva Agreement.\n      There is today only one part of the globe- South Africa- where racial\ndiscrimination is still practised. India, even before Independence, came out\nagainst apartheid, under the leadership of Gandhiji and later under\nJawaharlal Nehru. Even today, we are raising our voice with all our strength\nto end apartheid. We will not rest till apartheid is ended, till slavery is\nbanished from the world.\n      Similarly, India is also firmly supporting the Palestinian movement.\nWe would like an agreement to be reached so that Palestinians find a\nhome and return to their motherland. We want peace to return to that part\nof the world.\n     If poverty has to be removed and if weaker nations have to progress,\nthen it is essential to have nuclear disarmament. No country in the world\nhas raised its voice in favour of nuclear disarmament as strongly as India.\nFor the first time, an Action Plan was presented to the United Nations\nwhich would lead to disarmament and peace throughout the world. For the\nfirst time we presented a programme to secure everyone's co-operation.\nWe hope that nations will soon veer round and accept our plan. We know\nthat it cannot be achieved quickly. This is not an easy path.\n      About 40 years ago, Jawaharlal Nehru had framed a new foreign\npolicy based on the principles enunciated by Gandhiji. About 30 years ago\nPanditji had raised the flag of Non-alignment. Today we find that for the first\ntime there has been some action on Disarmament and on Non-alignment.\nThirty to thirty-five years after Jawaharlal Nehru had raised the question of\nDisarmament, an agreement has been reached on destroying nuclear\nweapons. We know that it is not an easy path. Nor will we be able to\ncomplete the course quickly. But we realise that if there has to be peace in\nthe world and if countries like India have to progress and become strong,\nand above all if the poor peoples of the world have to be uplifted, then we\nhave to cease spending funds on weapons and divert those resources to\neradicate poverty and uplift humanity. We are moving firmly in this direction\nand we will not allow any infirmity to creep in.\n       India's stock has risen high in the world. The country has earned\nrecognition and has participated in many major world decisions. We hope\nthat in the coming years also India will continue to play its role in\nworld affairs. We will carry the traditional spirit of India to the entire world,\nbecause only then will we be able to carve out the right path and reach the\nprinciples and ideology of Gandhiji to all corners of the world.\n       Today, on 15th August, we have to look to the future. We have to\nrecognise the challenges before the country. There are many challenges\nbut if I were to list them, I would rate poverty and unemployment as the\nmain challenges, followed by the task to make our country great and to\ntake it to the summit of glory where it was before the country was enslaved.\nWe have to do a lot to remove poverty. We have initiated many\nprogrammes, but a lot more has to be done. If we have to remove poverty\nand provide employment, we have first to look at our villages. When we\nlook at rural India, we have to look at the farmers and farm labourers who\nface enormous difficulties. Our effort is that, before anything else, we\nshould help this sector to progress. If we really have to develop agriculture,\nwe have to pay serious attention to land reforms. If land reforms are not\nimplemented particularly in eastern India, the green revolution will not be\nable to reach there. We will look at this problem seriously and\ntry to resolve it.\n        We have found that over the years we had the same agricultural plan\nfor farmers of the plains, for the hills, for desert areas and the south. We\nhave changed all that. We have divided the country into 15-16 agro-climatic\nzones. We are now minutely examining the problems that the farmers face-\nwhat kind of soil they have, what are their irrigation needs, how much\nfertiliser and the seeds they require and the crops they should sow. For the\nfirst time we are examining all this minutely. We hope that this year our\nagricultural sector makes fast progress. We are making every effort to raise\nour level of production and return to the targets we fixed three years ago,\nbecause only then shall we be able to help our farmers and farm labourers.\n       We are also faced with another enormous problem. During the last\n40-50 years our population has increased tremendously. While a lot of\ndevelopment has taken place, we find that where three-foul persons\nsubsisted on a bigha of land, there are 30-40 persons living off the same\nland now. Agricultural land has been utilised for constructing roads,\nhospitals, schools and other institutions. A lot development has taken place\nbut in the process land has become scarce. What we have to think about is\nhow many people can subsist on land. We have also to consider how\nothers can be provided employment. What is most essential is that\nemployment has to be provided in the village itself. We have to remove\nunemployment and we have to begin with the villages. This is what we are\nstriving to do. We have to see how value addition to the farmer’s produce\ncan take place; that the produce is processed, sells better and that the\nfarmer gets a good price. We have to establish small processing plants.\nOur endeavour would be to introduce the produce of Indian farmers to the\nwhole world and export our fruit, vegetables and foodgrains. We have, in\nthe Government, given special attention to this. We hope that we will be\nable to achieve rapid development especially in the backward and rural\nareas.\n       At the same time, we have also to ensure faster industrialisation\nbecause without it employment cannot be generated and unemployment\ncannot be removed. We have to identify new areas of employment. The\nworld is changing. A lot of changes have taken place in industry as also in\nthe life-styles. We have to keep pace with it and to find out new areas of\nemployment. We have moved fast in this direction also and hope that in the\ncoming months and years we will find a sea-change in the country, so that\nthe country gets stronger. Our poor and our youth will find employment and\nwe will be able to move rapidly ahead.\n      There is a great drawback that we have not been able to overcome. I\nreceive many complaints that our programmes do not fully reach the\ngrassroots level in rural areas. We have to think why this happens. I had\nhad many meetings and debated the matter for hours. It then became clear\nthat unless we made our Panchayati Raj institutions stronger and handed\nover responsibility to the people down below, nothing could be achieved.\nGandhiji had said this very clearly. He had said that his concept of Swaraj\ndid not mean that power should concentrate in the hands of a few. Rather it\nmeant that the people should have the capability to check misuse of power.\nThis is what we also want to do. If it requires a change in the law or even\nan amendment of the Constitution, we will certainly do it and leave no\nlacunae. We will see that power vests in the hands of the people because\nwe know that this is the only way to ensure the success of our programmes\nand to take them to the masses.\n      When we look towards the future, our thoughts turn to our nation and\nour country. We have to consider what kind of India we would like to make.\nWe shall remove poverty and we shall eliminate unemployment, but in what\nimages shall we mould our country? Our endeavour should be to take the\ncountry to the heights to which it belonged about 250-300 years ago,\nbefore people from different corners of the world set out to discover India.\nWe shall be able to achieve this only when we strengthen the unity and\nintegrity of India and battle with all those who wish to weaken the country.\nIndia will be strong only when every part of the nation is strong. India will\nremain strong only when the Centre remains strong. We will see at no one\nis able to weaken the Centre and that the Centre remains strong. We\ntogether carry on our shoulders the country's heritage. All of us are carrying\nforward the traditions of Gandhiji, Jawaharlal Nehru and Indiraji. We have\nto ensure that we follow their principles and their ideas. At the same time,\nwe have to remember that it is we who have to find answers to the\nproblems facing us today. We will not be able to find the answers in history.\nWe have to carve out our own path with courage and determination. We\nhave to remember that, if need be, we will have to make sacrifices.\nGandhiji made the sacrifice, Panditji made sacrifices and Indiraji sacrificed\nherself. All of us should be ready for whatever sacrifices are to be made. I\nam also ready to make sacrifices to make the country strong, to make it go\nforward, to take it to the pinnacle and make a place for itself in the world.\n     Let all of us pledge today that we will eradicate poverty and\nunemployment from the country, make India great and be ready for\nwhatever sacrifices are required. Today, on 15th August, I pledge from the\nramparts of the Red Fort that together we will restore India to its glory."},{"year":1987,"pm":"Rajiv Gandhi","party":"INC","title":"Forty Years of Independence","footnote":"Free rendering of address in Hindi from the ramparts of the Red Fort on the occasion of the Independence Day, Delhi, 15 August 1987","source":"Rajiv Gandhi, Selected Speeches and Writings, Vol 3","text":"Each anniversary of Independence is sacred to the country. On each\nanniversary we remember our freedom fighters. On this day we recall the\nbuilders of modern India. Today, standing on the sacred soil of Red Fort, I\nrecall 1857, when our first freedom fighters came to this Red Fort. I recall\n1945, when soldiers of the Indian National Army were prosecuted here.\nTheir only crime was that they fought for the freedom of of the motherland.\nIn 1947 at this very place, Panditji hoisted the flag of Independent India.\nToday, when we are assembled here, we remember the ideals, the\nprinciples, the values, and the dreams which inspired our freedom fighters\nto win freedom for the country. Today, all of us assembled here rededicate\nourselves to that cause. Jawaharlal Nehru had said, \"If we want to achieve\ngreat things, if we want to build a great India of our dreams, we shall have\nto become great ourselves and be worthy children of mother India.\"\n      On this fortieth anniversary, we naturally think not only of the events\nof the last one year but of the last 40 years. At the same time we look\nforward to the future as well.\n     Our elders got us freedom and entrusted us with the responsibility of\nsafeguarding and maintaining that freedom. It is our responsibility to protect\nit.\n        During these four decades we faced many situations, a number of\nthreats and also pressures. We faced conspiracies, we faced aggressions.\nWe did not bend, we protected the unity and integrity of India with our\ncourage, our blood and our sacrifices. We showed to the world that India is\nstrong, India is one and it cannot be divided. We demonstrated to the world\nthat no one can enslave us again. We made it clear that nobody can\nweaken the unity of India. We made it evident that no sacrifice is too big for\nthe security of our country, the independence of our country and the unity\nof our country. No amount of labour, no amount of sacrifice is too high a\nprice to pay of this purpose. Our soldiers, our officers give the best years of\ntheir lives to guard our frontiers and to defend us. In return we look after\nthem, we provide them with the best of weaponry and ammunition. We see\nto it that they get the best tools they need. We are pledged to do so. The\nfreedom of India means the freedom of the people of India. The freedom of\nIndia means that we should strengthen the roots of democracy, and hold\nimpartial elections in which every citizen can participate. We conduct\nParliament in such a way that the voice of the people of India is listened to.\nIt looks after and builds the future of the country. The meaning of free India\nis that it has an independent judiciary and rule of law. Free India means\nthat it has a free and unfettered press. But it is not so easy to protect\ndemocracy, especially when we find that there are people who endanger\nour freedom through irresponsibility and indiscipline, who show disrespect\nto the Constitution and its institutions through their behaviour. Still we have\ndemonstrated that the roots of democracy in our country are deep, Our\npeople must remain alert. It is only a Government based on democracy that\ncan function in a country like India.\n       Our great economic achievements have been acclaimed all over the\nworld. Gandhiji had taught us that the process of development and the task\nof building the country should begin with the people by eradicating poverty.\nHe taught us that the moral duties should be kept in the forefront in our\nnational life.\n      We have taken the country forward towards these very objectives.\nEradication of poverty has been given the highest priority. We have used\nour entire energy in eradicating poverty. Indiraji gave a call for eradicating\npoverty. She brought about a new awakening in the country as a result of\nwhich there was reduction in poverty. Because of her 20-Point Programme\nand other programmes for rural development, be it NREP or IRDP or any\nother, there has been improvement in the lives of the poor people of the\ncountry. We see that the picture has changed during the last 40 years.\nForty years ago two-third of India's population was below the poverty line.\nToday two-third of the population has come above the poverty line.\n      This achievement is due to our anti-poverty programmes. They have\nalso smashed the hold of feudalism. Eradication of poverty has been\ncarried forward through the Green Revolution. As a result, in just a few\nyears' time our production of foodgrains tripled. I remember the time when\nthere was drought 21 years ago, and Indiraji had to seek foodgrains from\nforeign countries. How small she felt when she had to bow down to others\nfor foodgrains. It was then that she decided that never again would India\nappeal to foreign countries for foodgrains. She overruled her technocrats\nand her other advisers and took steps which brought about the Green\nRevolution in the North-Western part of the country. Indiraji’s foresight and\nher determination coupled with the sweat and hard work of farmers of India,\nproduced these desired results. Today we can say with pride that India will\nnever go to others for food.\n       Similarly, at the time of independence, our manufactures were\nrestricted to a few simple things. Today, with the development that has\ntaken place during the last 40 years, our industries have progressed to\nsuch an extent that India can manufacture products comparable with those\nof advanced countries. We have today reached a stage from where we can\nleap forward with greater energy and compete with others. Our scientists\nhave shown to the world that they are capable of achieving the highest in\nthe field of science. Our technocrats have proved that they can master all\ntypes of technology successfully. The path ahead is long but none can say\nthat we have not traversed far enough during the last 40 years. We are\nbuilding the India of our future on the foundations of development that have\nbeen soundly laid during these 40 years. We shall see to it that our\nindustries grow and expand rapidly. We shall see to it that our youth get\nnew and more opportunities of employment. We have to see that our\nproductivity rises, prices go down and quality improves. It should be our\neffort to associate our workers in the public sector units with management.\nWe should ensure that our science and technology are not borrowed from\nforeign countries but develop in a way that benefits the country and also\nthe poor people of the country. They should be able to meet our demands\nand requirements. We also have to see that they go ahead and see the\nwork done in other parts of the world, meet the challenges and show the\nway to the world. The most important thing, however, is that we should not\nallow our attention to be diverted. Our attention must be concentrated all\nthe time on the poorest and the weakest person.\n       In the field of agriculture, production has increased a great deal, it\nhas reached 15 crore tonnes. But we find that it is stagnating at 15 crore\ntonnes for the last three years. It is true that the monsoon has not been\ngood during these years. Farmers in many regions and parts of the country\nhave to face difficulties but we are resolved to ensure that the farmers'\nproduce is not affected by the vagaries of weather in future. We have to\ntake steps to ensure increase in agricultural production in spite of adverse\nweather. Some 70 percent of our population reside in rural areas, and\nalmost the same percentage of people are poor and they earn their\nlivelihood in the agricultural farms. The number of agricultural labourers is\nmuch more than that of farmers. We have to pay special attention towards\nthem. If we want to eradicate poverty we have to begin with the farmers’\nfields. We have started spreading the Green Revolution and we are happy\nto see that during the last two years, an improvement has been noticed for\nthe first time in Uttar Pradesh. Improvement has also been noticed in Bihar,\nOrissa and Bengal where the output of farmers is increasing. Poverty has\nbeen reduced in the rural areas. At the same time we have to pay special\nattention to the production of cotton, oilseeds and pulses. In this way we\nwill see that with the spread of greenery poverty would be gradually\nreduced and would ultimately vanish.\n      This year we have provided more resources than ever before for\nprogrammes meant for the eradication of poverty. At the same time we\nhave strengthened the administration as part of the poverty eradication\nprogramme. I have myself travelled far and wide, and after seeing the work\nwith my own eyes and discussing the matter with the officers, strengthened\nthese programmes and intensified them. Most important of all we have\ntreated education as a part the poverty eradication programme because as\nlong as the children of the poor people do not get good education, poverty\ncannot be eradicated.\n      Today, however, we find another problem before us, a very serious\nproblem, that is of unemployment of the youth. We find signs of pessimism\nin our youth. Millions of our young people do not succeed in getting\nemployment and millions remain dissatisfied even after getting employment\nbecause they do not get what they want. We have to concentrate on the\nemployment scene. There are some weaknesses and deficiencies in our\nset-up. There is employment, there are jobs, but the education, the skills\nthat are required to fill up the vacancies are not there. Millions of boys and\ngirls are matriculates, millions of them are degree holders but all cannot get\nwhite-collar jobs. We have taken care of these things in our new education\npolicy. It has been our endeavour to make up the deficiency in our set-up.\nThrough this policy we will ensure that the boys and girls coming out of\nschools and colleges, get such education which provides them\nemployment. At the same time we will have to see that the rural\nemployment programmes and other developmental programmes are\nimplemented in such a way that the maximum number of people get jobs.\nBut this will be possible only when we make a rapid progress in all fields-\nagriculture, industry, infrastructure and services. Most important, perhaps,\nis the fact that we should succeed in the matter of self-employment. It is not\nso difficult to give jobs to all if we work with determination, if we examine\nthings properly and if we see to it that our education matches the required\nskills. If we increase the pace of progress, bring maximum number of\nyoung people to the technical trades and inspire them to start small\nenterprises, place maximum number of people in services, then that\nobjective can be achieved. We have to see that all people do not aspire for\njust government jobs; they should also go elsewhere. This can reduce\nunemployment and we are determined to eliminate unemployment. We\nshall place programmes before the country in the coming years to ensure\nthat unemployment is eradicated.\n      This year we are facing a difficult situation because of drought. Such\na widespread drought has not been experienced for many years. We had\nfaced a drought in 1965-66, that was grave but was grave but was confined\nto one or two regions. This year's drought has affected virtually all parts of\nthe country. However, thanks to Indiraji's far-sightedness which increased\nthe production of our farmers; our economy today is quite strong and we\ncan face the drought. There will be no shortage. No doubt there is drought,\nbut we can face it today because of the Green Revolution brought about by\nIndiraji. In many States this is the third or fourth year of drought. The poor\nare facing great hardships. Their basic needs are uppermost in our minds.\nOur minds also go out to the landless people and the marginal farmers who\nhave been rendered unemployed and who are not getting any work today.\nIn many States there is scarcity of drinking water as well. In many States\nthere is shortage of fodder for the cattle.\n       We will face the situation with all our might. As the head of the\nGovernment, I pledge that we will concentrate all our attention and accord\nthe highest priority to deal with this drought situation. We will see to it that\nwe are able to reach foodgrains to every nook and corner of rural India\nfrom our granaries. We will ensure that enough employment is provided to\nthe poor people through relief works. We will also ensure that employment\nis provided to all those who really need it. We will see to it that there is no\ndearth of food. Nobody will have to go hungry. We will strengthen our\npublic distribution system so that foodgrains reach all parts of the country,\nat the doorsteps of the people, especially in the rural areas so that people\ndo not have to go far, for food. We will ensure that there is no scarcity of\ndrinking water. We shall also pay special attention to the problem of fodder\nscarcity so that our cattle wealth and animals are also able to face this\ndifficult situation.\n       We have to make a large collective effort to deal with this drought\nsituation. At the Centre, as also in the States, we will see to it that all\nrequired assistance is provided by us. At the same time it is also to be seen\nthat the State Governments act firmly and with speed because it is they\nwho reach down to the villages. We will give all assistance but the State\nGovernments will have to move fast. I have written to the Chief Ministers of\nStates which are facing the drought situation. I shall call a meeting of the\nChief Ministers in which we shall discuss and decide how the drought\nsituation can be met collectively, and identify steps which are necessary to\nsave the poor people from difficulty. A great deal remains to be done. But\nsince the country is strong, we will accomplish the job and successfully\nface this challenge.\n       It is, however, necessary that we devote our full attention and energy\nto this problem. Our granaries are full. We have the experience and\ncapacity today. We can face this challenge of starvation without any foreign\nassistance, but we must be clear that it is not necessary to slow down the\npace of development in order to deal with the drought situation. By stalling\ndevelopment, by suspending development, we will have to face a greater\ncrisis in the days to come. We have to find resources so that without\nreducing or slowing the pace of development we can face the present\nchallenge. There is need for economy, austerity; it is necessary to reduce\nor eliminate non-essential expenditure. We have already advised each\nMinistry to start taking such steps. The State Governments should also\ntake similar steps. The Government will do whatever it can, but it cannot\ndeal with such a drought situation alone. In such a situation, it is necessary\nfor the people to meet this challenge together with the Government. The\nyoung people especially should come forward to face this challenge hand\nin hand with the Government and others. We have to see that each man\nand woman and individual and each community as a social group will join\nhands with the Government to face this grave situation. We should build up\nsuch a movement that reaches all parts of the country.\n       This is the time when more fortunate people should come to the\nrescue of the less fortunate ones. We have to see that no anti-social\nelement takes advantage of this situation to earn money and exploit the\nmiseries of the poor people. We will have to deal firmly with such elements.\nHoarding will have to be stopped, profiteering will have to be eliminated. If\nwe face the anti-social elements resolutely we will be able to keep the\nsituation under control. We will not spare any effort. With all the might of\nthe Government, we will see to it that the anti-social elements are kept\nunder control. Any lacuna in the law that may come in the way of dealing\nwith such people, will be removed, and the Government will acquire the\npowers necessary for dealing with them, but I appeal to all to co-operate\nfully in constructive co-operation from every quarter- from legislators, from\nMembers of Parliament, from the Opposition, from experts, and from the\npress. In the context of this challenge, it is necessary to forge a national\neffort to meet the situation effectively.\n       India has made remarkable social progress during the last 40 years.\nWe find that casteism has decreased during these years. Our women have\nbecome stronger. We have provided more opportunities to our girls to go to\nschools and colleges. We have specially encouraged them to go to\nschools. Last year, we consolidated further the anti-dowry law to strengthen\nthe hands of women and we find that since then the number of girls killed\nbecause of dowry problem has gone down. We hope to further increase the\nstrength of our women. We also have to pay attention towards our\nlabourers and their problems. During the last two years, we have passed a\nlegislation to prevent child labour. This law prohibits all employment of\nchildren in hazardous industries. The legislation provides for the education\nof children and also takes care of their food and health. The problem of\nagricultural labourers had been attended to during the past 40 years. We\nhave set up a National Commission to study the problems of agricultural\nlabourers and suggest programmes to deal with their problems.\n      The tribal people have their own problems, I have myself visited\nthose districts, the villages and also their huts to have an idea of their\nproblems and the way government programmes are being implemented,\nwhere these programmes need to be strengthened and where there is\nneed for assistance. We have paid special attention to the problems of our\nHarijan brothers. We will see to it that the hands of the Commissioner of\nScheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes are so strengthened that he is\nable to deal firmly with the situation wherever the Harijans and the tribal\npeople have not been given their due.\n       We will see to it that the legislation intended to uplift the Harijans and\nthe tribal people are strengthened, the provisions are effectively\nimplemented, and nobody is able to stall this work. We have implemented\nvery effectively the 15-Point directive of Smt. Indira Gandhi relating to the\nminority communities.\n       The middle class population has increased in the country because of\nincrease in economic opportunities. A large number of people now go to\ndifferent parts of the country to find employment. More and more people\nare now undertaking journeys in the country. People from one part of the\ncountry are going to other parts in search of jobs; they are getting\nemployment outside their homes, their villages, their districts and\nsometimes even outside their respective States. This consolidates the unity\nof the country as such people are able to see the vastness of the country.\nThe unity and integrity of the country is strengthened through these people.\nWe have achieved a lot during the last 40 years but even then, in spite of\nthe social progress, a lot still remains to be done.\n      Some of the problems are old and many new ones have cropped up.\nCommunal feelings have come to the fore in some places. We see the\nmisuse of religious places. The religious feelings of the people are being\ntoyed with. We find one community fighting with another community, a\nbrother fighting with his brother, a man fighting with another man; all these\ncause danger to our secularism.\n      Communalism and Sectarian forces were causing harm to the unity\nand integrity of the country during the days of the freedom struggle. We\nhad fought on the basis of concepts denouncing communalism. Even\ntoday, there is no room for communalism in India. India is an ancient\ncountry inhabited by people believing in different faiths since centuries,\nPeople belonging to all religions and all thoughts have resided here since\ntimes immemorial. We have seen that people of all traditions and all faiths\nhave lived like brothers in our society. There is no room at all for\ncommunalism in our society, our democracy. We have to face this\nchallenge. It is the duty of every citizen to ensure this by all his actions and\nthinking, He should maintain cordiality in the society. A majority of the\npeople who are deeply religious believe in true religion, and are secular\nand they should come forward and face those few people who weaken the\ncountry, who believe in sectarianism, who believe in fundamentalism, who\nbelieve in violence and who believe in looting and terrorism. There is no\nplace in India for those people who try to weaken the country in the name\nof religion. People of different communities have lived in this country for\ncenturies, peacefully working together, playing together and participating\nconstructively in each others lives. Sometimes, however, hatred raises its\nhead all of a sudden and things are on fire and there is terror.\n       Generally, outsiders are responsible for this and sometimes because\nof religious leaders. These people weaken us by spreading rumours,\ncreating misunderstanding and spreading falsehood.\n       Normally, innocent people fall victim to such conspiracies. Whenever\nsuch sectarian conflicts come to the fore, maximum harm is caused to the\ninnocent people/ They are the worst sufferers. Our war on sectarian forces\ncannot, however, be fought only through the machinery of law. This should\nbe a people’s war. It must be fought in every locality, in every area. We\nhave to ensure that all of us are one in this war against dangerous\ncriminals, and stop the misuse of religion, and eliminate the people\nspreading hatred. Those who are sowing the seeds of hatred among us\nmust be crushed. We must face such people who are out to destroy our\nsociety. Communalism gives rise to separatism. Communalism produces\nterrorism and efforts are being made to eliminate our democracy through\ncommunalism, separatism and terrorism.\n      We notice all sorts of methods are being employed to weaken our\ncountry and to disturb peace in our country. Efforts are being made to\ncreate ill-feelings among the tolerant and peaceful people of this country.\nWe do not have to submit to separatists; we have to face them. We will\nface all of them with all our might. We will face those who try to weaken our\nfreedom, our security and our future through threats, pressurisation and\ncausing infights. We will not allow them to rise. We will not stop till terrorism\nis completely eliminated or till the terrorists do not return to the country's\nmainstream giving up their arms. We do not have to give up our courage,\nwe do not have to be fearful. Gandhiji has said, \"Independence means\nfearlessness against death. A nation afraid of death cannot become free\nand if it attains freedom it cannot protect it.\"\n      The words of Gandhiji should resound in our ears today and we must\nface this challenge boldly. We must remember that we will not counter\nthem for taking revenge. If we try to take revenge, then it will only serve the\ndesigns of the terrorists. Revenge would only bring victory to terrorism. If\nwe use restraint, terrorism will weaken and will ultimately be defeated. We\nmust not fall into the trap of terrorism. Gandhiji has said that violence\ncannot be an answer to violence. Only non-violence can be the answer.\nIndia holds its head high in the world today. The voice of India is heard in\nthe world with respect. Why? How is it that a country which was a slave,\npoor till 40 years ago, and about which people used to think that it would\nnever stand on its own and could not safeguard its freedom, now speaks\nout in such a strong voice? It has been possible, because we moved\nforward taking with us the concepts of Gandhiji, principles of Panditji and\nthe path shown by Indiraji.\n      We have learnt to speak fearlessly, we have learnt not to submit\nunder pressures, we have learnt to move forward on the path of\nnon-violence with courage and facing the challenges boldly. We launched a\nmovement against the atomic weapons in the world during the last 40\nyears. Today many powerful countries are attracted towards it. The feeling\nthat Gandhiji and Panditji had brought to the fore before our Independence,\nis now spreading throughout the world after 40 or 50 years. It is just\ninsanity that we continue to manufacture weapons while the available\nweapons alone can extinguish the entire world 50 times. It is really\nmadness that 15 to 20 million rupees are spent every minute in the world\non arms race. Even a small fraction of it can be of great help in eradicating\npoverty, disease and unemployment. India is paying attention to these\nthings. We are paying attention to human rights and human dignity.\n       South Africa, where Gandhiji had started his first satyagraha, is still\nreeling under slavery. The flag of freedom has not still been unfurled there.\nIt is shameful that 100 years have passed, hundreds and thousands of\nfreedom fighters have offered sacrifices including their lives, but the place\nfrom where the flame of freedom rose is still under slavery. We have raised\nthe question of poor people in the world. We have taken up the cause of\nsuppressed sections of the world. We have demonstrated that our voice is\nthat of balance tolerance, compassion, truth and non-violence.\n       Last month we signed an agreement in Sri Lanka- an agreement that\nproved the correctness of our policy, which demonstrated that the impact of\nour foreign policy is good and that India was moving on the right path. This\nis an important achievement in these 40 years. The latest agreement that\nwe have reached and signed has brought peace and co-operation in Sri\nLanka. This has strengthened the cause of peace and co-operation in the\nentire region. We have checked the activities of those who were\nendangering the security of the entire region and have prevented rivalries\nof the power blocs reaching our neighbourhood. This has strengthened the\ncause of non-alignment. It has been proved that countries can solve their\nproblems through dialogue without allowing the big powers or other\nsections or parties to come in. We have seen that whenever outsiders\ninterfere, the problems become more serious and difficult. Today, on the\n40th anniversary of our Independence, we have to re-dedicate ourselves to\nthese ideas and concepts.\n        Our greatest asset is the system given to us by our forefathers. We\nhave seen that the system is in tune with our ancient traditions and our\nculture, which have flourished uninterrupted for thousands of years. We\nused that spirit in our struggle for freedom and should use it in building a\nnew India. Today, our greatest attainment is our democracy. We have to\nsafeguard it, consolidate it. No weakness should be allowed to permeate it.\nStill, we find that certain elements are trying to weaken it in a bid to\neliminate it. This system has existed for the last 40 years, and we have\nfound that under it India has gained in strength, it has remained one, it has\nprogressed and has been able to face the world. If some people for their\nown petty political development want to disrupt the faith of the people and\nharm our democracy just for their own development and benefit, we must\nstand up to them. We have to see to it that they do not gain in strength. We\nhave to ensure that they are not able to divert the attention of the country.\nWe must also see that they do not succeed in conspiring internally or from\noutside to weaken the country. It is true that a few things are not well in our\nsociety and our system. We will see to it that the people who are doing\nwrong things are dealt with promptly and firmly and are punished. Our\nconcentration today should, however, be on national reconstruction and not\non rumours. We must pay attention to national reconstruction and take the\ncountry on the path of progress. We should correct the flaws in our system\nand promote such policies which will further strengthen our society and the\nsystem. We are doing so and we are trying to move on the path of\nprogress. We would like to see that all sections of the people, especially\nthe youth, start a national campaign against complacency, sectarianism\nand corruption. We have to abide by the principles which Gandhiji placed\nbefore us. We must safeguard our freedom. We must strengthen our\nsociety. It should be our endeavour to see that people belonging to all\nsections of our society work for the welfare of the poor and the weak, and\nmaintain communal and religious harmony. We must ensure that Harijans,\ntribals and women progress in all respects in our society and consolidate\ntheir position. We have to be guided by Gandhiji's principles of truth,\nnon-violence and human unity.\n       At the same time, we have to ensure that we remain self-reliant. We\nmust remember that only right means can ensure the right end. Gandhiji's\nmessage was not meant for his generation alone. It was for all the future\ngenerations. This message is as important for the reconstruction and\nconsolidation of the country as it was for the achievement of our freedom. It\nis also of importance in the context of making the world stronger.\n       Today, I congratulate all my 78 crore brothers and sisters residing in\ndifferent parts and remote areas of this peaceful country, in this our India -\nyours and mine - of those who are rich, who are poor, young and the old,\npeople belonging to all religions, people belonging to different communities,\npeople belonging to all States, people speaking different languages, and\npeople having different cultures. Our unity is sound, our integrity is eternal.\nWe take inspiration from the past, to move confidently into the future. It is\nour firm resolve that we will unitedly move ahead on the path of progress to\nsafeguard our freedom, our democracy, our secularism, our socialism, our\nsecurity and our non-alignment, stage by stage, and make India really\ngreat."},{"year":1986,"pm":"Rajiv Gandhi","party":"INC","title":"Make India a Land of Peace and Prosperity","footnote":"Free rendering of Independence Day speech in Hindi from the ramparts of the Red Fort, 15 August 1986","source":"Rajiv Gandhi, Selected Speeches and Writings, Vol 2","text":"We are gathered here today at the Red Fort for the fortieth time. This\nFort is a symbol of India's glory. It is a symbol of India's strength. It was\nfrom here that the first call for Independence was given in 1857. It was here\nthat Shah Nawaz, Dhillon and Sehgal, followers of Subhas Chandra Bose,\nstood trial. There can be no greater sacrifice for the love of the country than\ntheirs. It was here that the British flag was lowered and the Indian tricolour\nfirst unfurled by Panditji. This flag, so dear to our hearts, commands our\ndeepest respect. Under this flag we fight for the nation's security and\nprogress. All of us are the children of Mother India. We will make India a\nland of peace, a land of prosperity. As we celebrate Independence Day,\nwhat do we understand by independence? What does freedom which we\nachieved on this day, mean to us? Does independence mean freedom of\nthe people, or do we also think of our land, our forests and the whole\nenvironment? Do we also think of development and progress of our\ncountry? Yes, all these form part of freedom which has a deeper, more\nfundamental meaning. We cannot forget our ancient culture, our values and\nthere cannot be any deviation from our principles. We have to follow\ntraditions and maintain our heritage.\n       What are these values? The foremost is the principle of nationalism.\nThe idea of nationhood is not new for India; it has been deeply embedded\nin the hearts and minds of the people of India for thousands of years.\nNobody has been able to dislodge it. Whether we had political unity or we\nwere under foreign rule, nobody was able to erase the feeling of Indianness\nwhich was always deep in our hearts. Today's free India- a glorious,\nself-reliant nation committed to its ideals of unity and integrity- is the\nmanifestation of this sense of nationalism.\n       If India is strong every Indian is strong; if India is weak every Indian\nwill be weak. Our endeavour has always been to make the people of India\nstrong and the future of the country secure. In our strength lies our honour,\nour progress. Being an Indian does not mean that we are mere inhabitants\nof this country. It means that we are inheritors of a splendid civilization of\nover five thousand years. We have a diversity of cultures. We belong to\ndifferent religions- Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Christians, Jains, Parsis,\nBuddhists. We speak a variety of languages. Our tolerance makes all of\nthem flourish. We accord equal respect to all faiths and religions. Our\nstrength and unity flow from this fact. This is the only path we must follow,\nfor our strength lies in our diversity.\n      Independence meant the opportunity to govern the country in\naccordance with our wishes. Like us, many other nations attained freedom,\nbut in very few of them do we find the people the real masters, as in India.\nIndia has vouchsafed to its citizens all human rights. If we also look at other\nnations, we can see how many nations have been able to follow the same\npath as India and who have been able to give the same kind of freedom\nand rights which we have given to our people and who have been able to\npreserve their democracy. In India, the government is in the hands of the\npeople. The people can change a government whenever they so desire.\nThey shape their destiny.\n     In India free elections have been held in a democratic set-up. We\nhave a free Press and we have laws under which all citizens are equal. We\nhave taken up democratic development. We aim at self-reliance: We\nremain non-aligned in foreign policy. Our path comprises all these three\naspects.\n      We have only to recall the situation during British rule to realise the\nprogress that India has made. During British rule, deaths from hunger and\nfamine were common. Just before Independence, 30 lakh people died in\nthe Bengal famine. During 50 years from 1900 to 1950, our agricultural\noutput remained static. But from 1950 to 1985 the output increased\nthreefold. Wheat production increased sevenfold and that of paddy fivefold.\nOn this occasion, I would like to extend my congratulations to the farmers\nof India, for it is due to their hard work that we are independent today.\n      In public health before Independence, the infant mortality rate was\nvery high. We introduced a vigorous health programme under which\nthousands of primary health centres were set up. We have eradicated\nsmallpox and controlled malaria. The life expectancy of our people has\nvirtually doubled and it is over 56 years now. I should like to congratulate\nour doctors and nurses and others who have made this possible.\n      Likewise, in the field of education, almost every village has a school\ntoday. The education policy which had outlived its relevance and with which\nwe were no longer happy has been changed. We have formulated a new\neducation policy which will provide India a new path leading to strength,\nunity and self-reliance.\n       A vast network of roads has been provided to villages. Drinking water\nis now available in most rural and tribal areas and it will be our endeavour\nto see that by the end of the Seventh Plan there is no village left in the\ncountry without drinking water facility. Industrialisation has provided\nemployment to crores of people. We can see that India has shaken off its\nbackwardness and emerged as a progressive and dynamic nation.\nIndustrial production has gone a long way to improve the quality of their\nlives, and put the country on the path of progress and prosperity.\n       Our scientists and technologists have today brought India at par with\nthe developed countries of the world in many fields. We do not think of\nscience and technology for its own sake, but for the common man, the poor\nand the backward. When we talk of science and technology our objective is\nto bring it within the reach of the poor people in our villages. Today, when\nwe look into the future and visualise the India of the 21st century, we see\nbefore us a strong, self-reliant, self-confident and economically sound\nnation. This will be achieved through our emphasis on self-reliance, by\nmaintaining our dignity and our honour, by seeing to it that our flag flies\nhigh and we move in the world with our head held high. We have been\nfollowing this path in the past and we will continue to do so in future also.\nWe have taken care that India does not sink into the debt trap. Other\nnations have got bogged down in heavy debts in the pursuit of\ndevelopment. We have ensured that India does not give in to the pressures\nof multinationals. This is the only way to our progress and strength. We will\nnot swerve from this path of progress.\n      Of paramount importance to us is the welfare of the poor, the\ndeprived and the backward. With all our might, we are endeavouring to\nbetter their lot and remove poverty through our anti-poverty programmes,\nthrough 20-Point Programme and through our agricultural development\nprogrammes. Agricultural development is the main plank for removal of\npoverty, because of the dominance of agriculture in our economy. During\nthe last five we have succeeded in bringing nearly 10 crore people above\nthe poverty line through these programmes. We hope that by the end of the\nSeventh Plan, we will be able to lift three quarters of the country's\npopulation above the poverty line. Our effort is to wipe out poverty from the\ncountry.\n      I propose to place shortly before the nation a revised 20-Point\nProgramme. We have modified and improved the current 20-Point\nProgramme. Such of these programmes which have been completed and\nhave fulfilled their objectives are being dropped and new ones are being\nintroduced. We will ensure greater employment opportunities under the\nrevised 20-Point Programme.\n       During the last one year, I have toured the country extensively. I\nmade it a point to visit the most backward and most poverty-stricken areas,\namong which are tribal areas. I have talked to the poorest of the poor. I\nhave spoken to villagers, to farmers in their homes, in their huts, in their\nfields. I have met them at places where relief work was in progress. I have\nshared their difficulties, their miseries. At the same time, I have seen their\nsuccess, hopes, tolerance, inner strength, perseverance, hard work and\nstruggle. I have seen how bravely they were facing their problems and\ndifficulties and how they were fighting the vested interests, the landlords,\nthe zamindars and the bureaucracy. I am with the country's poor, the\noppressed and the weaker sections of our society. We are committed to\ntheir uplift.\n       Among the backward and oppressed people are the poor Harijans,\nthe tribals and our womenfolk, who perhaps form the largest oppressed\nsection of our society. We must ensure that all kinds of discrimination\nagainst them is removed and for this, I can assure you, we shall take all the\nnecessary steps. We may have to change our policies, modify our\nprogrammes and strengthen our laws for the uplift of the Harijans, tribals\nand women. It will be our endeavour to see that our womenfolk receive\ngreater respect, equal rights and economic independence.\n       At the same time, we cannot afford to lose sight of our ancient\nphilosophical heritage which teaches us that development does not come\nabout only through acquisition of wealth. Accumulation of wealth generates\ngreed and selfishness. It causes more dissatisfaction and leads to misery.\nTherefore, while we pursue development, we must lay stress on moral\nvalues. We have to see that our cultural heritage, the age-old values which\nhave sustained us down the years and kept us united, are maintained and\npreserved. Since Independence we have made tremendous progress. The\nsigns of progress are visible in all fields. But we have to look into the future\nalso and ensure that it becomes brighter. There is one serious threat to it\nand that is communalism. It is a matter of shame and a disservice to the\nnation that people are being killed, houses burnt and shops looted. We\ncannot afford to let this happen and we will not let it happen. Any kind of\nviolence is wrong, but the worst kind of violence is that which takes place in\nthe name of religion. This, in fact, is a fraud on religion. True religion stands\nfor love and tolerance, love for all fellow beings and respect for all faiths.\nDifferent religions are only different paths leading to the same destination.\nGod is reached through many paths. We also see that the snake of\nfundamentalism is raising its ugly head in our country. Fundamentalism\nleads to hatred and violence, The Government will take steps to wipe it out,\nand if it requires the use of force we will not hesitate to do so. We will not\nallow communalism and violence to spread, we will eliminate them from our\nsociety.\n      Last year when I was speaking to you from here, we had signed the\nPunjab accord. A dialogue followed and we covered a lot of ground.\nElections were held in Punjab and a popular government took office once\nagain and democracy was restored. Because of the accord we have been\nable to fight terrorism and extremism in Punjab. Side by side, we have\ntaken steps to improve the training of the police and to ensure that they get\nthe best possible equipment. We have seen to it that they get the best\npossible equipment. We have seen to it that there are no shortcomings in\nthis sphere. The situation today is that the extremists are on the run and a\nlarge number of them are being apprehended or killed. During the last few\nweeks many extremists have been captured. This objective will be pursued\nmore vigorously. I am sure that over the next few months we will be able to\ntackle terrorism and wipe out the terrorists completely. This will have to\nhappen soon, for we cannot permit this to go on for long. But what is\nhappening is that whenever we meet with some success in tackling this\nproblem, there is a corresponding frustration among them and then they try\nto build up their confidence by doing something drastic. For instance last\nyear we saw the assassination of Sant Longowal. This year they have killed\nGeneral Vaidya. Both these incidents have caused us great grief. The\nterrorists resorted to these killings when they found that they were being\narrested, uprooted and eliminated and the public was turning against them.\n       Now that the pressure is on the extremists, it is possible that they\nmay resort to some further killings to shake the confidence of the people or\nto provoke reprisals from the people. But we will remain calm in the face of\nsuch provocation. We will see to it that no innocent person is harmed. We\nwill not fall into their trap. I am sure the people will not fall prey to the\nterrorists' designs. We will have our own strategy and finish them. We will\nsee that every measure that is called for to wipe out the terrorists is taken.\nWe will not be found lacking in the use of force, police action, political will\nand dedication. This calls for a lot of moral courage and removal a number\nof misconceptions. It is strange that violence and arson take place in the\nname of religion, in the name of saints and gurus. While there is no doubt\nthat the full might of the Government is called for to tackle the question of\nextremism, it is essential that the people also extend their conscious\nsupport and take a firm stand against this menace. If we want to fight\nextremism, we can do so if all the 75 crore Indians stand together. We can\nface extremism unitedly in keeping with the traditions of non-violence.\nGandhiji said that the philosophy of non-violence is not merely for sants\nand rishis but it is also a faith to be followed by the common man.\nNon-violence makes the people strong. Gandhiji taught us that violence\nand intolerance expose our weaknesses. He proved that hatred and\nintolerance should not be countered with hatred and intolerance. He\nshowed us the path of peace and non-violence. We can fight terrorism only\nthrough peace and non-violence. And we will triumph over terrorism\nthrough this path of tolerance and communal harmony. We have to see that\nthe people unite irrespective of their religion, caste and language and fight\nthis war against terrorism just as they fought for Independence.\n        If India has to progress then we have to look not only inward but\noutward also, across our frontiers, at the outside world. The world today is\nfaced with a great danger- a danger that threatens to destroy this planet,\nthreatens to impede the progress of India. If India has to become strong,\nand if we have to ensure regional security in our part of the world, then\nthere is only one way to accomplish this. War will know no frontiers and it\nwill not be confined within the borders of the warring countries. It can\ndestroy the whole world, can annihilate the entire mankind. It is our effort to\nput a stop to the mad race for nuclear weapons. There is only one way and\nthat is disarmament. It is only when nuclear weapons are destroyed that\nthe farmers and the people of India can be assured of security. Our stand\non the question of disarmament is very clear and eloquent- for peace, for\nthe future of the world and for the future of mankind. Our foreign policy\ngives us strength. We have remained independent and contributed to world\npeace. If we have to follow the path of progress and development, world\npeace is essential. In the international forums India's voice is heard loud\nand clear. The voice of India is the voice of the 75 crores of its people. In\nthis lies our strength.\n     Today we command respect in the comity of nations because we\nhave followed the path of non-alignment and self-reliance. We speak with\ncourage, conviction and confidence.\n      In a sense non-alignment is international democracy. It does not pose\nany threat to our independence. The concept of non-alignment was given\nto the world by Panditji. Indiraji carried the torch forward. The Non-aligned\nMovement which began in a small way has a membership of 101 countries\ntoday. Today, two-thirds of the countries in the world speak the voice of the\nnon-alignment. During the last few years, India was the Chairperson of the\nNon-aligned Movement. We were faced with many problems- the problem\nof Grenada, the Libyan issue, apartheid and the flouting of international\nlaws by the bigger countries. The world passed through a difficult phase,\nbut under India's leadership the Non-aligned Movement gained strength\nand contributed to world peace.\n        On the occasion of Independence Day today, I extend my warm\nfelicitations to all my countrymen. My special, greetings to the members of\nour armed forces, to those who are guarding our frontiers whether in the\ndesert, on the high mountains or in the dense forests. It is because of their\nsacrifices that India has been able to preserve her freedom again and\nagain.\n        As I stand here I see before me temples, mosques, gurudwaras and\nchurches. This is the real wealth of India and this is where our real strength\nlies. As I stand here my mind goes to Gandhiji and Panditji. I also think of\nMaulana Azad, Sardar Patel, Rajendra Babu, Rajaji, Subhas Chandra\nBose, Shastriji and Indiraji. Indiraji stood here at this very spot at the Red\nFort sixteen times. She fought for India's poor and the backward throughout\nher life. She fought for India's unity and integrity and laid down her life for it.\nThe responsibility of fulfilling her tasks lies on our shoulders and we will\nfulfil her dreams in every way. Let us dedicate ourselves to preserving and\nsafeguarding our independence, democracy, secularism, socialism and the\nunity, integrity and honour of the country."},{"year":1985,"pm":"Rajiv Gandhi","party":"INC","title":"Let Us Strengthen India","footnote":"Free rendering of Independence Day speech in Hindi from the ramparts of Red Fort, 15 August 1985","source":"Rajiv Gandhi, Selected Speeches and Writings, Vol 1","text":"We are today celebrating the thirty-eighth anniversary of India's\nIndependence. On this occasion, I extend my greetings to all citizens, in\nevery village and town, to our farmers and workers, to our mothers and\nsisters, to the children of India, to menfolk, to our armed forces and to all\nIndians living abroad.\n       Thirty-eight years ago, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru for the first time\nunfurled the tricolour at this very Red Fort. Indiraji should have been here\ntoday but she has been snatched away from us. The task has fallen on me.\nI did not see the struggle for Independence. When the tricolour was\nunfurled here for the first time, I was only three years old. Today, two-thirds\nof the people of India are like me, who have not participated in the country's\nstruggle for Independence. A new generation has come to the fore. The\nstruggle for Independence is as much our inheritance as the Himalayas,\nthe Ganges, the Plateau of Deccan, Ajanta, Taj Mahal and Mahabalipuram,\nthe arts, philosophy and science of India.\n      Who is not filled with pride when thinking of the Buddha, Kabir, Nanak\nand Gandhiji? We are filled with pride when we think of the sacrifices by\nour freedom fighters who trailed a new path of truth and non-violence\nduring our freedom struggle.\n      We have achieved considerable progress in the last 38 years. During\nthese years, we have been able to lift nearly 63 percent of our population\nabove the poverty line. A new middle class has emerged. We have become\nself-sufficient in foodgrains. The entire world wonders at the way we have\nbeen able to mould and advance our science and technology, our\nindependent foreign policy, our democracy, liberty and secularism. And we\nhave been able to achieve this despite the three or four wars we had to\nface, preserving all the time the unity and integrity of India. We have been\nable to do it because we were shown the right path by Gandhiji, Panditji\nand Indiraji. The journey, however, is still very long and difficult. We have to\nbattle with poverty and eradicate it altogether. This is the only path for us to\nfollow and we have to eliminate poverty with all the strength at our\ncommand.\n       How was it that India could achieve all this while many other\ndeveloping countries have fallen on the wayside, embroiled in their own\ndifficulties? We could do it because we took recourse to science and\ntechnology for the amelioration of poverty. We saw to it that science and\ntechnology were applied in the right manner. The initiative was taken by\nPanditji, by constructing huge dams, setting up large steel plants and\nencouraging the promotion of science. He focussed his attention on the\npoor and the farmers of India. The foundation laid by Panditji enabled the\nfarmers to treble their production with the help of science and technology.\nThis saved our confidence.\n       Indiraji gave a new impetus to the eradication of poverty. In the last\nfew years, the percentage of people brought above the poverty line has\ngone up from 49 to 63. In the last few weeks I have travelled over various\nparts of the country. I have gone to tribal districts and villages and visited\nhutments of the Harijans. I have travelled from from the hills to the desert of\nRajasthan. The problems of the poor were identical. In the cities too, I have\nvisited the hutments of the poor. The purpose of all this was to find how we\ncould improve our programmes and streamline the administration to ensure\nthat the poor people of India are able to receive full benefits from these\nprogrammes.\n      The path we have followed is the same which was shown to us by\nPanditji to take science and technology to the hearths and homes of the\npoorest of the poor. We are considering how this objective can be achieved\nand how science and technology can be utilised to provide the maximum\nbenefit to the poor. For instance, we do not find a drop of water in the\ndeserts of Rajasthan. We can, however, use satellite pictures to locate\nunderground water. Similarly, we can provide better quality seeds to the\nfarmers to increase production. We would like to see that power, water and\nother inputs reach\nfarmers and workers to help increase production and make the country\nstronger. The country will forge ahead only when rural India is able to\nmarch forward. We should devote our full energy for the uplift of rural India.\n      We must see that regional imbalances in the growth of various parts\nof the country are removed and all the States progress evenly. We shall\nensure that all citizens of the country get full opportunity to contribute their\nmight towards India's progress. It is towards this end that we have\nformulated the Seventh Plan which aims not only at economic development\nbut the total advancement and\nstrengthening of Indian society. The framework of this Plan will be shortly\nbefore you. We hope that the country will progress substantially under the\nPlan and that in these five years, we shall march ahead at a pace at which\nIndia has never marched before.\n      There is no change in our principles. Following the path shown to us\nby Gandhiji and Panditji, we want the development process to reach every\nnook and corner of our country. Gandhiji talked of Swadeshi. Thirty eight\nyears ago, not even a needle was made in India. Swadeshi, then, meant\nonly Khadi. Panditji opened the vistas of science and technology for us and\nIndia moved ahead. Today, when we talk of Swadeshi, we do not mean\nKhadi alone. We mean indigenous industry, indigenous computer and\npower from indigenous atomic energy sources. The meaning of Swadeshi\nhas undergone a sea-change in the last 38 years and it goes to prove how\nmuch progress India has made. This is what we are proud of.\n       However much we might progress and develop economically, I would\nthink that we have not really progressed if, in the process we lose our\ninheritance, our traditions, our culture and civilisation. We have to see that\nalong with economic development, we develop and strengthen our\ncharacter. It is for this purpose that during this very month we shall present\nto you a new format of education which we hope will bring about new\nawareness in every corner and every\nvillage country and will provide a new impetus to the country's progress.\nWe have to see that human development takes place with full vigour all\nover the country.\n     There are obstacles in our way, the biggest being internal\ndissensions based on religion, caste, language or region. We must make\nsure that these dissensions do not acquire extremist dimensions. We have\nalso to ensure that such disputes weaken the foundations of our\ndemocracy. They weaken the coun and retard its progress.\n       Many people have lost their lives due to extremist activities. Gandhiii\nlost his life 38 years ago and Indiraji only ten months ago. Communal\nconflicts have done immense harm to the country and we have to root out\ncommunalism from the midst of us all. They have taken toll of not only\nGandhiji and Indiraji but have harmed every one in the country. Whenever\nbig leaders like Gandhiji and Indiraji die, its impact is felt all over the world.\nIndira Gandhi was not the leader of India alone. The whole world\nrecognised her as a leader of the poor. There have been few leaders who\nwere able to make such a name for themselves in the world. Today the\ncountry has to make a pledge to end communal differences and raise it\nvoice against terrorism. We have to make sure that we use our energies for\ncreating an atmosphere in which we can live like brothers.\n      You thrust a responsibility on me 41 weeks ago. In these 41 weeks,\nwe have done many things to redeem our pledges. The biggest challenge\nconfronting us was to maintain the unity and integrity of India. Ten months\nago, the world was watching whether India would remain united or\ndisintegrate into pieces. Today, that question just does not arise. Today\nIndia has emerged before the world as a very strong country. We had the\nproblem of terrorism in Punjab. We took steps and, a few weeks ago, an\nagreement was signed. We hope that complete peace will be restored in\nPunjab and the State will make rapid progress on the road to development.\nThe tension that existed has eased and the country can now move rapidly\nahead.\n      The other problem was of Assam. Negotiations were going on for\nmany years but a solution had eluded us. I am happy to tell you that last\nnight, or rather today at 2.45 a.m., an agreement was signed between the\nAssam students and the Government of India. We hope that with the\nsigning of this agreement, another element of tension will be removed and\nthe country will be able to address itself to rapid development.\n       During the elections, we had promised to wage a battle against\ncorruption. We have taken a couple of steps and are in the process of\ntaking a third one in this direction. First of all, we brought the anti-defection\nbill, got it passed and implemented it, removing thereby a great infirmity\nfrom our politics. Secondly, we allowed political parties to accept donations.\nThis will minimise corruption. We are now ready to take the third step and\nintroduce the Lokpal bill. We hope this bill will be presented soon and a\nmajor cause of complaint will be removed.\n       We had also promised to cleanse the Ganga. The purity of Ganga\nhad a special significance for every Indian heart. But the Ganga is getting\npolluted because we are dumping a great lot of rubbish into it. We are\ntaking firm and swift action to cleanse the Ganga. Likewise, we have vast\nexpanses of waste land in the country. We are going to plant crores of\ntrees in the waste lands to be able to provide firewood for the poor and\nfodder for cattle. Recently, we have modified our textile policy. In\nrestructuring this policy, our endeavour is to see that our weavers are able\nto sell more and earn larger profits.\n       We had also pledged to strive for peace in our neighbourhood. We\ninitiated talks with Sri Lanka and these talks are being continued today in\nBhutan. We hope that just as we have been able to resolve the problem of\nPunjab and Assam, they will also be able to bring about peace in Sri Lanka.\nThis will lead to an easing of tension in the South and our people will be\nless worried. We are trying to improve further our friendly relations with\nBhutan, Nepal and China. We are also talking to Pakistan and have made\nsome progress. However, there is one major hurdle in our way. Their\nAtomic Energy Programme makes us feel that Pakistan is moving towards\ndeveloping an atomic bomb. If there is to be complete friendship and\nconfidence between our two countries, Pakistan should reconsider this\nprogramme.\n      In the last few months I went to the Soviet Union and to the United\nStates of America and held the Indian Flag higher. Today, every citizen of\nIndia can stand upright and look the world in the eye. India is independent\nin every respect and strong and cannot be subjected to any pressure.\nIn certain parts of the world, the struggle for freedom started along with the\nfreedom struggle launched by Congress. When Congress won freedom,\nmany countries of Africa and Asia were able to gain their independence.\nBut in South Africa, where Gandhiji had first launched his movement, the\npeople are still enslaved and oppressed. We have extended our full support\nto our brothers and sisters in South Africa who are struggling for their\nindependence. We wish that other countries too, especially the developed\ncountries, will extend similar support to them. We must see that slavery,\nespecially the kind of slavery practised in South Africa, is ended at the\nearliest.\n      All our pledges and all the measures we might take will be nullified if\nwe fail to remove poverty in our country. So, we are focussing our special\nattention to poverty alleviation programmes. Wherever there are loopholes,\nwe are trying to plug them and implement our programmes more\nvigorously. Where extra help is needed we are ready to give it. We are\nreviewing these programmes and will shortly bring forth a modified\nProgramme structured in a manner that will ensure greater benefits to the\npoor and lesser financial involvement of the administration. We hope that\nthe 63 percent lifted above the poverty line will grow into a larger proportion\nrapidly in the coming years so that we are really able to proclaim to the\nworld that poverty has been eradicated from India.\n     Today, on August 15, every citizen of the country should pledge to\ndedicate his life for strengthening the nation and the values it stands for.\nHand in hand let us move forward faster to achieve our goals.

It is not a mere ritual\nfunction. We assemble here in the memory of those of our brave\ncountrymen who suffered during the long struggle for Independence and\nalso sacrificed their lives. This movement had a long time-span and people\ntoday do not know about it as much as they should. The younger\ngeneration is hardly familiar with it. I cannot describe it all here. However,\njust to illustrate, how people belonging to different religions were\nassociated with the struggle, I should like to mention of some of our leaders\nwho participated in the freedom movement. Tilak, Dadabhai Naoroji, Dr.\nAnsari of Delhi, Tayabji Saheb were people of one generation. Then,\nMahatma Gandhi returned to India and the course of the freedom\nmovement took a new turn in which not only the intelligentsia and other\ndistinguished people participated, but also farmers, workers, the younger\ngeneration and people drawn from various walks of life became\nco-partners.\n       Why do we hoist the national flag on the Red Fort? This place had\nnot been a symbol of Independence. In fact, it is a symbol of the olden\ndays. Netaji Subhas Bose declared that when we became independent, we\nwould hoist the national flag on the Red Fort. For this reason, the first\nPrime Minister of India, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, hoisted the national in\nAugust 1947, and since then, every Prime Minister is performing this duty.\nPrior to that, three of our brave countrymen were imprisoned in this Red\nFort. They had not adopted our path. Although their path was different, they\ntoo were prepared to sacrifice everything for the cause of freedom and their\nlove for the country. People of Delhi know Shri Shah Nawaz Khan. He was\na Muslim. Then, there were Prem Sehgal and Dhillon. This selection was\nneither ours, nor of the alien rulers. Still, by coincidence, they belonged to\nthree different religions. I am saying all this because I feel we should know\nhow the country became independent.\n      We got independence because people of all religions, all provinces\nand all communities were united. There was only one objective-- freedom\nof the country. Freedom is our birthright. Today we have different issues\nbefore us. During those days, we had only one objective and we fought for\nit. Today, we have to preserve the Independence thus gained and the\nefforts for this cannot be less arduous. The obstacles, the barriers, the\ndangers and the threats we faced during those days are all present even\ntoday, though in different shapes.\n       Some people say that I talk of these external dangers in order to\ndivert the people's attention from the domestic issues. There cannot be a\ngreater misunderstanding than this, because we cannot maintain the\nsolidarity of the nation and solve our problems without knowing fully the\ntravails the country is confronted with and the difficulties that people of all\nwalks of life are facing. We are glad that we are free, but our hearts today\nare not full of joy. We have sorrows and anxieties. We are sad because we\nhave not learnt the lessons of our history. We are sad because such forces\nare again raising their head which may endanger the unity of the country by\nspreading poison.\n      I should like to remind you that communal disturbances which take\nplace in the name of religion and cost lives of numerous innocent people\nand lead to destruction of property, are not communal alone, though they\nappear to be so. Behind these are political and economic considerations\nand narrowness of mind.\n      Communal disturbances have occurred in Andhra Pradesh,\nKarnataka, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh in the recent past. Some have\nalso taken place in other States. The sorrow is not only that of individuals,\nfamilies or communities but of entire India. It is a black spot on the entire\ncountry and it is our duty to root out all such elements from our soil.\n      In our democratic system, there may be differences in many spheres\nbut we rise above them. To achieve the objective of keeping the country\nunited, we have to transcend political and party-based differences which\ncreate dissensions between one another. If we cannot remain united and\nthe country does not remain strong, with whom shall we have differences?\nAgainst whom shall we fight? With whom shall we make friendship, if\nnobody exists? Brothers and sisters, if the country falls, nobody survives.\nWhen we were fighting for the freedom of our country, it did not mean only\npolitical freedom. It also meant social justice, equality and economic justice.\nOnly one phase is over and another one is under way. We have to cover a\nlong and difficult path. Whereas the enemies were visible during those\ndays, now they are in disguise. Some of them are open enemies, but many\nbecome unintentional pawns of others.\n        Everyone of us has now Punjab in mind. I do not want to go into the\nstory of Punjab here. I have spoken about it a number of times. However,\nsince some sinister propaganda is being carried on, I should like to say a\nfew words. A vast number of people are participating in this function though\nall of them are not present and visible here.\n      Since I spoke to you last year, TV and radio have reached a large\nnumber of remote villages. So also power supply has improved and\ndrinking water has reached many new areas. All efforts have been made to\nhelp the poor, be it in the field of medical assistance or educational. I shall\ntalk about this later. At the moment, I should like to say that whatever\nmovements are conducted in one or another State with any ostensible\npurpose, in course of time these pass into the hands of elements who do\nnot subscribe to the objectives of the movement or have something else in\ntheir mind, giving a new turn to the entire movement. They bring violence,\nmurder, intimidation and so on into the movements and the organizers of\nthe\nmovement lose control over the situation. This is exactly what has\nhappened in Punjab.\n      Propaganda is being carried on, specially in foreign newspapers and\ntelevision, giving the impression as if we did not even discuss the demands\nthat had been put forward. You all know how long-drawn-out the\ndiscussions were. Differences were narrowed down to only a few points. As\ntaught by Gandhiji, Jawaharlal Nehru and Maulana Azad, it has been our\npolicy, whether within the country or in the international field, to reach the\nmaximum possible extent of understanding, thus maintaining friendship,\nand not giving any offence from our side.\n       Whosoever has any demand, be he pro or against me, I have always\nlistened to it and have tried to meet it as far as possible. But I have my\nlimitations. The resources are limited. Funds are limited. We cannot go\nbeyond these limitations. Sometimes there are demands which please\nsome sections of the people but annoy others and can lead to serious\ndiscontent in other States. Therefore, we have to consider all the relevant\nfactors. I should like to request those who have some demands either in\nthe name of a State or a religion or a language or some other issue, to look\naround to ensure that the fulfilment of their demand does not aggrieve\nothers. They should think whether their demand would not impose an\neconomic burden on the country which may weaken the country or crush it\naltogether under its load. Economic hardship will not spare them either. We\nhave taken care of everyone in our plans and it is our effort to help all\nsections of the people and States, so that they may all progress and\ndevelop.\n       Nowadays, the relations between the Centre and the States are being\ndiscussed. I too, have said that we can discuss them and I am confident\nthat if the issue is approached sincerely, a compromise can be arrived at\neasily.\n      In 1960-61, the States were getting a sum of Rs. 500 crore from the\nCentre. Now, they are getting Rs. 12,000 crore. A stupendous increase,\nindeed. Still neither the States are happy nor the Central Ministries\ncontented. They all say that they are not getting enough. I agree that\namount does not suffice for their needs but we must also not forget that\neven in rich countries, the needs of all cannot be met fully.\n       Demands will not only remain, but will in fact increase. What we have\nto see is that while meeting the demands of those people who are\ncomparatively well off, we do not ignore or cause harm to those people who\nare weak and underprivileged. They must not get poorer as a result of the\nfulfilment of the demands of the affluent. The country will become strong\nonly if the poor people of the country also become strong. In their strength\nlies the welfare of the affluent as well.\n       I hope that demands will be put forth not to further self-interests but to\nsecure the welfare of the country and for helping the relatively weaker\nsections as well as for the all-round progress of the country. This is why our\nemphasis has been on helping the weaker sections as far as possible. This\nis the objective of the 20-Point Programme through which 15 million\nfamilies have been helped to raise their standard of living. Many countries\ndo not have even a total population of 15 million. But in a country with a\npopulation of 700 million, the figure is not that impressive. There is no\nmagic that can benefit all these 700 million people immediately.\n       The 20-Point Programme was initiated only recently. Employment\nhas been arranged through it and successes have been achieved in\nproviding employment to a good number of young men, rural as well as\nurban. Progress has also been made in providing loans as well as in other\nfields. I know there are shortcomings. I know that some people have made\nmistakes. Some people have complained to me in this regard.\n       Those who do not reside in Delhi, or are listening to me for the first\ntime, may be surprised to know that whenever I am in Delhi, barring the\nholidays, I meet people in my house every morning, ranging from a few to a\nfew thousand. These people come from all walks of life, all religions and all\nparts of the country. Some people say they come just to see me, some\nothers narrate their woes, a few others lodge complaints and some others\npraise the progress made. There are people who think that I waste my time\nby meeting them. Many leaders of other countries do not do so. But I feel\nthat this helps me in getting an idea of the true picture of the country and\nthe feelings of the people. It is certainly not a waste of time.\n      The area under irrigation has increased considerably. Some of our\nfarmer friends have launched agitations. But whatever we could achieve for\nthe farmers during the last four years remains unparalleled. Of course, the\nfarmers were always given due consideration during the freedom\nmovement as also afterwards. Actually, they were at the root of our\nmovement. They are our food-givers. I know that the prices of some of the\ncommodities that they consume have gone up. We are trying to help them,\nhave actually done so. Chemical fertilizers are being supplied to them at\nrates lower than the actuals by providing subsidies to the extent of Rs. 800\ncrore. This is not an easy task for a poor country. The prices of their\nproducts have also comparatively increased. It is, however, true that the\ncommodities that they need have become dearer in our country as well as\nin other countries. It is also true that along with progress, demands keep on\nincreasing.\n      People who could not even think of tractors and threshers and were\nnot using chemical fertilizers or pesticides two or three years ago have now\nstarted using them and their demands for these commodities are on the\nincrease. Demands, however, outpace production. This results in rise in\nprices. We have to take all these factors into consideration. If we are\ndependent on them, they too are dependent on the production of the\nfactories. We have to pay attention to the industrial workers also and\nensure justice to them. Sometimes we are at fault, at times the millowners\nare to blame and at other times they are themselves at fault. The existence\nof many unions in a factory or a unit and their internal rivalries not only\nresult in wastage of time, but also harm production. We have to pay\nattention to such things.\n      Every section should view its problems in the larger perspective of\nIndia to be able to appreciate the difficulties of others-farmers, industrial\nworkers, housewives, etc. Housewives are trying to run their households\nmost economically in these days of rising prices. Not only the people of\nIndia but of the entire world are victims of rising prices. We are trying our\nbest to make available essential commodities to the people throughout the\ncountry.\n      A sum of Rs. 850 crore is being spent to help the rationing system to\ncarry food grains to the remotest areas. We are trying to augment this\namount. If somebody indulges in dishonest practices and corruption,\nstringent action should be taken against him. For this, however, it is\nnecessary to know immediately who did what and where. If people say it is\ndone by all and everywhere, it will be difficult to take action against the\nculprits. Local people have to be vigilant in this regard. If they remain alert,\nno atrocities can be perpetuated on the Harijans, people of the minority\ncommunities and womenfolk. Alertness will help solutions to problems. We\nare trying to further tighten legislation in this regard. We also try to foresee\nthe problems and solutions thereof, even before they come to the surface.\n       This is an age of self-reliance. Our slogan is that our nation should be\nself-reliant. What does a nation mean? It is not the land, but each one of\nyou wheresoever you may be living. We want all of you to be self-reliant.\nWe are trying to help you to become that. It casts a responsibility upon you\n-- the responsibility to do your duty. Please see that violence does not take\nplace. Please see that holy or religious places are not converted into focal\npoints of violence and crime and accumulation of arms. It is your duty to\nsee that communalism does not raise its head. Wherever there are\nindications, please go there, as our workers used to do during the days of\nthe freedom movement. They used to bring about peace in the area by\npacifying the people's anger.\n      This is feasible, because we have done it in the past. India has\naccomplished many tremendous tasks in the past and I am confident about\nthe future as well.\n       Dangers always exist in a country. In a country of diversities of\nreligions and languages, beliefs and traditions, internal rivalries are quite\nnatural to an extent. But we have never considered diversities to be a\nsymbol of weakness. On the contrary, diversities enrich us and add to the\npicturesqueness of our society. We do not want any religion or tradition to\nbe curtailed. Everyone should be able to follow his own path.\n       But all the paths should merge in the ocean of Indianness, as the\nrivers merge into the sea. The synthesis of different beliefs and traditions\nconstitutes Indianness: We must follow our faiths sincerely and should not\nimpose ourselves on people not belonging to our own faith. If the people\nfollow their faiths sincerely, they will prove better citizens. No religion\npreaches violence. Every religion urges brotherhood, love and compassion.\nIf the country follows this path, we shall be able to build a new society.\n      A new society is even now being shaped, and modernity is emerging\nout of the old traditions. This is one reason why some problems have\ncropped up in our country. Some pressures and problems have also come\nfrom outside. Life is a mixture of sorrows and happiness. Each one of you,\nwhether a child or the grown up, must have experienced this in your life. To\nrise above our sorrows or to be crushed under them lies in our hands. No\nGovernment or political party can offer help in this regard. It is our\nself-confidence and the internal power that help us to overcome them.\nToday, on Independence Day, we should bear this in mind.\n      During the last four years, as you would have seen or heard or read,\nsome events have taken place every year which enhanced the prestige of\nour country in the community of nations and also in our hearts. We,\nhowever, do not take advantage of that as other countries do. By 'we', I do\nnot mean me or the Government, but the people of India. We did not make\nuse of them to strengthen further our unity and the national pride, as all\nothers do. This has been our shortcoming.\n      When the Asian Games were held here, I know how pleased the\npeople of Delhi were. Young men belonging to Opposition parties also\ncame to me and expressed their happiness and thanked me for holding the\nGames, although they said they did not agree with me in many other\nmatters. A propaganda was, however, carried on that so much of money\nwas being wasted without any useful return. You saw recently, in what spirit\nanother country took up the same job. We have to see in what spirit the\nentire country should utilize such occasions so as to strengthen the unity,\nmorale and self-respect of the country, instead of viewing events from a\npartisan angle. This is the greatest need.\n      Now, another responsibility has developed upon us the responsibility\nfor some other countries besides our own. People call it leadership. I am\nnot fond of becoming a leader. I would only say that we have been\nprovided with an opportunity to serve a hundred other countries in the best\npossible manner. I admit there are differences amongst us.\n     Fighting is going on in some countries and we are trying to stop it,\nalthough we have not succeeded so far. For example, the war between Iran\nand Iraq. We are in constant touch with the leaders of these countries. We\nare also corresponding with other leaders to explore possible solutions.\nMany people have come here. Our officers and ministers have also visited\nthese two countries besides other countries and our efforts are still on.\nSome other countries are also facing disturbances.\n       Recently, disturbances have broken out in one of our neighbouring\ncountries. As you know, our policy has been of friendship and we have not\nignored any avenue that leads to improved friendship, whether it is\nPakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, or Sri Lanka. They are our close neighbours.\nMany years ago, when Jawaharlal Nehru was Prime Minister, he had\nsuggested that India and Pakistan should enter into a No-War Pact. The\nsame thing was repeated by the late respected Shastriji and myself in\ndifferent forms and on different occasions. Pakistan, however, did not\nrespond. After I became the Prime Minister again, and they acquired\nsophisticated weapons, they linked it with the idea of such a pact. We are\nnot against it. We ourselves want it, but we said: So far you had been\nignoring our suggestions and now, since you have raised this issue, will it\nnot be proper to have a treaty of friendship, co-operation and peace\nbetween us, so as to create a better atmosphere? If we enter into such a\npact, naturally, there will be no war. Otherwise also, all these were part of\nthe Simla Agreement. These have been recorded and duly signed by the\ntwo countries. If, however, you do not like that agreement, we can have a\nnew agreement on these lines. But to say no to a treaty of friendship,\ncooperation and peace, and still ask for a No-War Pact, I ask you, my\nfriends, how is it possible? How can we take it seriously? Still, we are trying\nto have something. I am sorry to find that their TV and newspapers carry\nreports about India which are far from reality and which may also be termed\nas interference in our internal matters. Still, we are taking up matters with\nthem in all courtesy and in a friendly manner. But no government can\noverlook the interests of the country and its self-respect.\n      The situation in Sri Lanka is quite grave and my heart is full of grief\nfor those innocent people who are being attacked without having done\nanything wrong. There are extremists and terrorists there as well and it is\nevident that a government is required to counter them. But the manner in\nwhich a particular community is being attacked for the last so many years\nhas come in the way of restoration of peace and the situation has gradually\ndeteriorated. We do not want to interfere. We do not want to put any\nobstacle in the unity of another country. That would not be in our interest.\nWe want our neighbouring countries to be stable and friendly towards us.\nWe extended our hand of friendship and offered help in having a dialogue\nand arriving at some conclusions acceptable to all.\n       The grief is of our entire country, although our Tamil brothers are\naffected most by the happenings there. Already 40,000 refugees have\narrived. It is possible that people other than the sufferers may also have\ncome with them and there may also be some spies amongst them. I cannot\nsay what is the actual position. Our frontiers are such that in spite of our\nbest efforts, such intrusions cannot always be checked. Still, we are making\nefforts. Patrolling has been intensified. I urged the President of Sri Lanka to\nhave a dialogue somehow. He had himself suggested this and we had\nhoped that under his leadership progress would be made and an\nagreement would be arrived at. But so far I find only reports of unpleasant\nincidents. We are fully seized of the problem and we have all sympathy for\nthe suffering people.\n       Our sea frontiers are vulnerable. But when I talk about these, it is not\nfor diverting attention from our internal problems. I want our internal\nproblems to be solved expeditiously so that we remain united and strong\nenough to face any danger. By accusing each other, or by lowering the\nmorale of the police force and the army, we cannot make the country\nstrong. Whenever aggressions have taken place, our jawans have faced\nthem bravely and sacrificed their lives. Whenever a calamity has occurred,\nwhether in the form of floods or something else- our jawans have\nparticipated in the fight for peace and helped people. How can we not\npraise them? It is natural for a human being to err sometimes, whether a\njawan or a politician or a public servant. Just because of the fault of one,\nwe should not weaken the morale of the country. This will be neither in the\ninterest of the country nor in that of a citizen, or a political party. I am very\nsorry to see that some people do not hesitate in raising any point if it helps\nthem get some publicity or benefit. I do not think that will really benefit\nthem. On the other hand, this will harm the country and our morale.\n      We must remember, on this Independence Day, that just to attain\nIndependence is not enough. We have to strive consistently to preserve it.\nWe must guard this flame of freedom from every storm through our labour\nand, if necessary, by laying down our life. Each one of us must take this\nvow today.\n       Earlier, when I referred to the 20-Point Programme, I stated that the\nuplift of the poor people and weaker sections of the society and to help the\nsmall farmers were our objectives. More than Rs. 1.000 crore have been\nallotted for these programmes. If a problem is faced in any part of the\ncountry, we take care of it. Soon the Seventh Plan will be launched. The\nobjectives of this Plan are already known to you. These are: food,\nemployment and productivity. All these are interrelated. If production does\nnot increase, there cannot be employment, as also food. To achieve these\nobjectives, we have placed adequate funds exclusively for the purpose.\nThis will strengthen further the foundations of our country. Simultaneously,\nwe have to help each other.\n      The struggle for the country's freedom had started even prior to our\nmovement, but it did not succeed, because it was not a combined effort.\nYou know what happened in 1857. You may hear about it more this\nevening. Why did not that revolution succeed? Because the people, in spite\nof sympathizing with it, did not step forward as soldiers for the cause.\n      We know that the last phase of the movement led by Gandhiji started\non August 9, 1942. We celebrate the day every year. Why did we succeed?\nIt was not because of violence, or enmity towards anyone. Our enmity was\nnot towards Englishmen or England, but towards imperialism. We fought\nagainst imperialism and even today we are with people fighting against\nimperialism, as in South Africa. Besides the local population, Indians too\nare there. They do not have any freedom. They do not enjoy even the\nelementary rights of citizenship. Therefore, how can we not raise our voice\nin their favour?\n     You have to think over all this. One great leader had said, if one\nperson is deprived of freedom, all of us lose our freedom. If any country is\nenslaved, the shadows of slavery fall on us all. Freedom and peace must\nprevail universally. Their blessing must be available to all.\n       India had been trying for peace everywhere. Recently, along with the\nPresidents or Prime Ministers of five other countries, I issued an appeal to\nthe nations of the world against nuclear weapons. A one-hundredth part of\nthe nuclear weapons now in store is enough to annihilate the entire\nhumanity. Still, these weapons are being manufactured and accumulated.\nAnd India is blamed. India has some nuclear capacity. Our scientists have\nproved that they can do it. But we do not want to develop our nuclear\ncapacity to produce a bomb. We do not have a single bomb. We want to\nuse nuclear power to produce energy so as to help the farmers, we want to\nuse it for medical science.\n      No programme of ours, whether it relates to space, sports, or\nscience, can succeed if our young men do not come forward. Had they not\nenough capability, we could not have advanced. We are doing all this to\nminimize the sufferings of the poor people and the middle class people of\nthe country in whom lies the nation's strength. In some fields we lag behind.\nThis is but natural in view of the fact that the industrial revolution took place\nin some major countries 200 years ago. Now, how do we catch up with\nthem, if our young people do not engage themselves in constructive work\nbut indulge in destruction?\n      I am repeating this time and again because I know the creative\ncapacity of our new generation. Our young people who are at school or\ncollege or in other institutions, have constructive talents. We have only to\nbring them out. We are forgetting our ancient ideals. We talk of religions\nand tradition, but do not pay attention to their basics. Their spirit calls for\nbeing good to others, helping others and creating a peaceful atmosphere. If\nwe forget these ideals, we cannot advance. We have to bring about a\nsocial change and improve economic conditions. At the same time, we\nhave to develop our spiritual strength without which we cannot be a great\nnation. We have to develop our moral values which are in abundance in\nIndia. We must not lose them.\n      This flag is a symbol, and not a mere piece of cloth. It is a symbol of\nthe Independence of India, the sacrifice of India and the bright future of\nIndia. Today, we all express our sympathies for all those who are suffering\non account of drought or floods or communal riots or some other reasons,\nand pray for their well-being. I also pray for good rains, so that food\nproduction goes up and reaches one and all. This will help our country to\nmarch on the path of progress and show to the world a new road of peace\nand friendship."},{"year":1983,"pm":"Indira Gandhi","party":"INC","title":"Make India Strong and Great","footnote":"Free rendering of an address in Hindi from the Red Fort, Delhi, August 15, 1983","source":"Selected Speeches of Indira Gandhi: January 1, 1982-October 30, 1984","text":"A birth anniversary, be it of an individual or of a country. is an\nauspicious occasion and a day of rejoicing. All of us celebrate it, be it here\nor in our homes. In earlier years, the radio carried the voice from here to\nthe other parts of the country. Last year, however, television began carrying\nthe images from here to a few big cities. But today television pictures of this\nceremony will reach many small towns also, marking the beginning of the\nprogramme to reach television to 70 percent area of the country. This is\nhow all progress takes place- gradually.\n      It is a day when we recall our struggle for independence. We\nremember Mahatma Gandhi, his other colleagues and disciples and many\nothers about whom you must have read. But there were hundreds and\nthousands of other brave freedom fighters who also sacrificed everything. A\nfew thousand of them fortunately are still with us. We remember them all\nand when we remember them, we also ponder as to what lesson we should\nlearn from their sacrifices.\n      There are some who say that whichever Prime Minister spoke from\nthe Red Fort, repeated the same thing every year. What a strange thing to\nsay! The ideals that we set for ourselves, the things that build up character\nand raise the morale of the people, concern for the security, progress and\ndevelopment of the country- are not all these duties incumbent on us\ntoday? Can our basic thinking ever get outdated? Should we not remember\nthese duties each year, indeed each day! And repeat them to ourselves, in\nour hearts and minds? This is true not only of our country, it is true of all\ncountries. This is not the occasion to talk at great length about our\nachievements, of the big things that have been done for raising the\nstandard of living of the common people. But the record is there for\neveryone to see. Our own countrymen, as also people of other countries,\nknow about it and you must have read how the leaders of big countries\nhave been talking about it. It does not mean, however, that our task has\nbeen completed. It also does not mean that we have turned all our\naspirations into reality. But it does mean that we have progressed along the\npath shown to us by our great leaders and that we continue to advance\ndespite all difficulties and dangers and despite the fact that at times we\nhave also faltered. Perhaps many of the difficulties we face today are due\nto this fact.\n       Once enslaved, poor, oppressed and timid, this country is today able\nto hold its head high. You look at the achievements. Some of them are\nreally big. We have increased power generation. Earlier, power was\navailable in a mere 3,000 cities and towns, and hardly any villages. Today,\n3 lakh villages have been electrified and, of course, power is available in all\ntowns. This is only a small example of what has indeed happened. I have\nalready mentioned about television. You also know how we have sent our\nown satellites into space and how we can utilize them for the benefit of the\nfarmers and others. At Kalpakkam, near Madras, our engineers, with wholly\nindigenous know-how, have set up an atomic power plant. In another two\nmonths we plan to send another satellite into space. All these are big steps\nwhich have relevance to our life, to the lives of the working class and\nstudents and also the everyday lives of housewives. Since we met here\nlast, the Asian Games were organized in this city. It was a show of young\npeople. That was followed by the Nonaligned Summit, which was an\nindication of India's capabilities, and the whole world had occasion witness\nit.\n      I also take this opportunity to congratulate our young sportsmen who\nhave kept the country's head high. I specially want to congratulate our\ncricket team for winning the World Cup recently. Those young men remind\nus of the brave youth whose courage shone through during our freedom\nstruggle.\n       But do not imagine that other young men, our children, our farmers\nand our workers, don't deserve congratulations. All of them sweat hard in\ntheir given field of activity and step by step they are carrying India forward. I\ncongratulate them all. We do not know their names, we have not seen\nthem, nor can we identify them. Yet, they are the foundation of India- the\npoor belonging to the Scheduled Castes, the tribals and the backward\ncommunities. I myself do not believe in caste and I would wish that it is\nrooted out from our country. We should all consider ourselves one. We are\nequal citizens of a great country.\n      Today, when we look at our achievements, we should also cast a\nglance at our shortcomings. What are the things that have held us back\nand what are the stumbling blocks which do not let us progress fast enough\nif we were to learn a lesson from the freedom struggle, we would find that\nonly unity and discipline lead to success. We find today that intentionally or\nunintentionally some people and some sections of the community hurt\nsociety in the name of that community, hurt religion in the name of religion,\nand hurt the country in the name of their region. These are our\nweaknesses. These are the elements that have held India back, eroded\nmorale and sapped self-confidence.\n       There are agitations in many parts of the country and people are\nmaking demands. This is but natural in a democracy. We are always\nprepared to talk to people and also meet their demands to the extent\npossible. But we also have to be careful all the time that while meeting the\ndemands of one group, we do not hurt the interests of others or weaken\nthem. Therefore, while considering these demands we have to discuss with\nall concerned and take into consideration their interests. We cannot satisfy\nall, but the least we can attempt is to see that there is minimum\ndissatisfaction. Whether the leaders of agitations want it or not, experience\nshows that violence creeps in. We cannot always find out who indulges in\nviolence. When we find out, we do punish such people. Sometimes the\nagitators themselves do not know who is indulging in violence, but it harms\nthe country all the same and the developmental process stops. Thus, those\nwho launch agitations complaining of neglect contribute to the slowing\ndown of development.\n       Let us look at some of the problems that dog us. There is the problem\nof Assam, about which there has been some strange propaganda. There\nare certain aspects of the problem which have an element of truth. It is true\nthat foreigners have come and our effort is to stop their infiltration, identify\nthose who have entered illegally and make some other arrangements for\nthem. This is not something new. When I discussed in the first time, I made\nsome suggestions to the leaders of the Assam agitation. They said, \"Either\nyou accede to all our demands or we will not let you go forward with\nwhatever you want to do.\" The result was that the process of identification,\nwhich could have gone ahead in the last few years, was held up. Now they\nwant that process to be started and this work has begun just as we had\nearlier offered.\n       There is another strange accusation. Many people lost their lives in\nthe attacks that took place there. Many of them were our Muslim brothers\nand sisters. Their villages were burnt. But also those of Hindus, tribals,\nScheduled Castes, labourers from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. I have\nexpressed sympathy towards all the victims and condemned those who\ntook the law into their own hands. Yet, the propaganda is as though we had\na hand in the killings. If you go and talk to the affected people, they will say\nclearly who was really engaged in rescuing and protecting them and\nmaking their lives secure. It is true that at places the security was lax which\nresulted in killings. To that extent it is our responsibility but the propaganda\nsuggests as though we instigated the killings. Who are the people indulging\nin this propaganda? They are the very persons who delivered inflammatory\nspeeches, instigated people and created an atmosphere of threat and\nviolence.\n       There is also the problem of Punjab. I do not want to go into the\ndetails: they have been repeatedly mentioned. Our effort in this country has\nalways been to see that every community and every region receives justice\nand a fair share of the total wealth and resources of the country. Whatever\ndemands I could meet from my side were accepted by me at the very\nbeginning, but will it be just on my part to take decisions which may\nconcern other regions and on which there may be no agreement? I may\nrecall that it is being alleged that I am deliberately stalling a decision. Can\nthe Central Government gain if any region or any community were to\nremain weak? Won't it rather weaken the Central Government itself\nbecause our strength depends on the strength of our regions? What is the\nCentre? Is it only the City of Delhi or the Secretariat or the Prime Minister's\nOffice? The Centre is that which holds everyone together and is\nresponsible for the security of the country. It is also responsible for\nensuring justice to all. Therefore, no one who is at a comparative\nadvantage whether an individual or a State should claim more than due. All\nthe same, the real power belongs to our States. Whenever there are\nconstraints on resources, it puts strain on us as well. There are cuts\nimposed on the Central ministries and also on the States. We are not\nhappy about it, but we are helpless. If there are rains, it immediately\nchanges our prospects: but in the event of drought or floods we all suffer. If\nthe agitations, on which so much money is spent, were not there, we could\nmake headway faster.\n      I was speaking about Punjab. This problem came up before me about\ntwo years back. My Government came into power in 1980. I should like to\nremind you that the people who are today agitating and making demands\nwere in power in Punjab for three years earlier. During those three years\nthey had all the opportunities to resolve their problems and meet their own\ndemands. However, they did not raise their voice then. I should like to ask\nthem and also pose this question to you, as to why they did not resolve\nthese problems. Aren't they guilty of failure to act when they had the\nopportunities? Why did they not act? Probably because even at that time\nthey could not have got whatever they wanted. So, when we came to\npower the entire responsibility was thrust on us. We are ready to resolve\nthe problem provided the agitators are willing to sit down and reach an\nagreement with those others also who are concerned with this problem.\n      There are many other voices being raised which make us feel that the\nstrength and unity of the country may be threatened. Fortunately, the sense\nof unity in the country is very strong. In connection with Assam, another\nfalse propaganda is being carried out throughout India. When I spoke about\nthe minorities, I used to be accused of being more concerned about\nMuslims, Sikhs, Christians and other minorities. It was alleged that I was\nnot bothered about the Hindu majority. May I remind you that in our\ncountry one community may be in a minority in one part and in a majority in\nanother? Similarly, people belonging to one religion may be in a minority at\none place and in a majority at another. The new line taken by detractors is\nthat I am not at all worried about the minorities and that I go along with\nwhat the majority wants.\n      All political parties want votes at the time of elections. But today,\nstanding here on the ramparts of the Red Fort and recalling our freedom\nstruggle, let us also remember the era in which we were born, the life we\nspent, the sacrifices we made and the services we rendered. While it is\nnatural to rejoice in victory and be saddened by defeat, our tradition\nteaches us that there is something above victory and defeat, and that is our\nduty. Our duty is to take care of our country. Even though we may not be\nable to complete the task, we should proceed along the path of progress to\nthe extent we are capable.\n      Many people laid down their lives during the freedom struggle. Many\ndid not live to see Independence. When we were young we did not imagine\nthat we would be able to attain freedom within our lifetime. Yet that thought\ndid not let us falter in our step nor did it weaken our resolve. We knew that\nwe would take the country up to the point we were capable of and that later\nothers would carry the flag. Today we are engaged in the task of\ndevelopment in the same spirit and the same spirit moves us in making the\ncountry stronger.\n       The country faces many dangers. There are external dangers and our\ninternal weaknesses. I do not want to scare you and I know that you are not\nthe ones to be scared. It is our responsibility, however, to recognize the\nsituation. Only when we recognize the crisis can we keep ourselves fully\nprepared to face it. Today imperialism is not of the kind it used to be. Today\nit does not intrude into a country with troops. It exerts a variety of pressures\nin a surreptitious manner, pressures which are economic, political and of\nother kinds, which are not less pernicious than armed intrusion and in fact\nmore dangerous because the common people are not able to recognize\nthem. We have seen what has happened in many countries. They are\nindependent and yet there is a shadow over their independence. India does\nnot want that. Our path is clear. We want to be self-reliant through\ndemocracy, socialism and nonalignment. Some say that we are tilting this\nway or that, but we take all our decisions keeping the interest of India in\nview as also the interest of world peace. We might be more friendly with\nsome than others but we have not allowed friendship or disagreement to\ncome in the way of our decisions. We take the right decision and it is that\nwhich accounts for whatever success we have had in all spheres. Everyone\nknows that we are a country with ideals. It does not mean that we are able\nto achieve all our ideals or that we do not have failings and do not commit\nmistakes.\n       Unfortunately, the problem of corruption comes up and we regret to\nsay that corruption is there. But it will be wrong if we were to raise the issue\nof corruption to the level of a bogey and insist that it will grow stronger. We\nhave to see how to eradicate this evil from our life. There is corruption in\nother countries, too, but we are not concerned with them. We are\nconcerned with ourselves and we must fully strive to root out this problem\nfrom all spheres-- from politics, from among the officials, from traders and\nothers. We must raise our sights above our own gains and ask ourselves\nwhether we are prepared to weaken the entire society for our own petty\ngain. We should ask ourselves whether we are prepared to bring in a\nsituation wherein our future generations will be harmed. Every citizen has\nto give thought to it. Atrocities have been committed against women. This is\nnot something new. The time has come when this cannot be tolerated any\nmore. The time has come when the entire society must see that no atrocity\nis tolerated either against women or against men. Our women, our young\nmen, our farmers who are the country's backbone, our workers who are our\nlimbs and all our people- whatever region, language or religion they may\nbelong to-- must be strengthened. All of them have the right to receive\njustice and they will be strong only when they do receive justice. This\nstupendous task cannot be carried out by the Government or the officials\nalone. It can be accomplished only when every citizen realizes that as a\ncitizen of India it is equally his responsibility because that alone will ensure\nhis future. And if the future were dim, it will not only hurt him but will also\nhurt the coming generations. This is the spirit that must be imbibed.\n       I said just now that the country faced dangers. There may be no\ndirect threat to our borders at this time. But there is an atmosphere of war\nthroughout the world. India has always been peaceful and that is why we\nhave had a big role in initiating the Nonaligned Movement. We want\nfriendship with our neighbours. There have been some recent\ndevelopments and I should like to reiterate that we do not want to interfere\nin the affairs of any other country. Countries must resolve their internal\nproblems themselves. But if there is large-scale violence, killings and loot,\nwe have to condemn it. And we have always done so. In our neighbouring\ncountry, Sri Lanka, with whom India has had close relations, things have\nhappened which have also affected the Indian citizens there. It is natural for\nus to be concerned. We have no intention to interfere. We want to maintain\nour friendship and our relations. We do not want that anyone should suffer\nbut because our people have been attacked, our own citizens and those\nwho emigrated from here, we are particularly concerned and we express\nour sympathy with those who have been the victims of violence. We must\ndeal with all these problems in the most responsible manner. One wrong\nstep taken in excitement could lead to far-reaching harm, making it difficult\nto restore balance. By God's grace we have so far shown great\nforbearance in all these international problems.\n       We have always tried first to understand the problem and then take\nsteps with great care and caution. In this way we have succeeded in our\nefforts. We should not do anything which may harm those whom we want\nto help. People of Indian origin are living in several countries and some of\nthem have become citizens of the countries of their adoption but some\nhave remained Indian citizens. We should keep the interests of all those\npeople in mind. We do not want to interfere in anybody's internal affairs.\nWhen humanitarian aspect is involved, we must speak out.\n      As I have said earlier, I am not concerned with any one caste or\nreligion. I am concerned for all, whether they are Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs or\nof other religions. I am concerned because they all belong to India, not\nbecause they belong to any particular religion. They are all human beings.\nToday's world is convulsed by an economic crisis. There are challenges\neverywhere. There is unemployment. Here, I want to say something about\nthe unemployment in our own country. It is a serious problem and we have\nbeen paying attention to it. We have just evolved two schemes, one for the\nlandless people who are the worst hit in our countryside and who bear the\nbrunt of the problem of unemployment. We want that at least one member\nof each family should get employment. This programme is going to be\nlaunched shortly and a big sum has been provided for it. Initially, this\nprogramme was started in Maharashtra where it was a success. We are,\ntherefore, now extending it to the entire country. But I should like to remind\nyou that we cannot cover everyone all at once. We hope that initially we will\nbe able to cover about 30 lakh persons and as we achieve success, others\nalso will be covered by the programme.\n      Similarly, in the urban areas, the educated young men are under\nsevere strain. It is our effort, therefore, to provide resources every year for\n2.5 lakh educated unemployed young men to stand on their own legs.\nThus, each year new programmes are introduced.\n      Many people have ridiculed our 20-Point Programme, but the fact\nremains that it has made an impact. There have been some shortcomings\nbut generally it has benefited people and is continuing to benefit them. You\ncan see its impact if you go to the villages. Those who ridiculed the\nprogramme perhaps don't remember what the countryside was like and\nwhat kind of poverty prevailed. It is a matter of satisfaction that the old\nscenario has now faded out. We are progressing and we shall continue to\nprogress.\n      We do not want to fight with anyone, but you know that we have been\nattacked in the past and it has been an experience which we cannot forget.\nWe, therefore, have to keep ourselves in readiness. Here I want to say a\nword about the brave officers and jawans of our armed forces. They have\ndefended our borders with great courage and bravery. With the same\ndevotion, they are also helping our people during floods and other natural\ncalamities in peace time. They deserve our congratulations.\n        We must forget high or low, we must forget where we live, what is our\nstatus and what are our views. But we must remember our motto to make\nIndia strong and great and all our thoughts must be how to progress along\nthat path. I greet you all once again, particularly our young men and\nwomen. In their eyes there is new hope, on their shoulders new\nresponsibilities, and in their hearts new courage. We are all full of this new\nspirit, whatever be our age. In this I include myself. You and I are but\nservants of one nation. We must not think about our status; we must\nalways think in terms of serving the weaker sections and those who, due to\nsome reason, have remained backward. We must always think how to list\nthe downtrodden so that we may march forward together and make the\ncountry strong and great. We must strengthen the country not only from the\neconomic or political point of view but also morally and intellectually. Let us\ntoday take a pledge that we will not do or say anything which may\ndenigrate our country in any way. We must keep the common man's morale\nhigh, make him self-confident and self-reliant. If we take this pledge and act\naccordingly in the next year, then we can work wonders. Not once but\nmany times we the people of India have shown that whenever we take a\ndecision with firm determination, we can achieve success. Let us show this\nonce again, my brothers and sisters. I again salute you and wish you a\nhappy future."},{"year":1982,"pm":"Indira Gandhi","party":"INC","title":"Let us all Build a Strong Nation","footnote":"Free rendering of an address in Hindi from the Red Fort, Delhi, August 15, 1982","source":"Selected Speeches of Indira Gandhi: January 1, 1982-October 30, 1984","text":"I want to reach the millions of my countrymen, not only those who are\nsitting in front of me, or the people of Delhi, but also those who are\nwitnessing this function through INSAT and are participating with us in this\nhappy celebration. I also want my voice to reach those millions of my Indian\nbrothers and sisters who are outside the country and those who cannot\nlisten to me either through the radio or the INSAT but only through their\nhearts.\n      Today is our 36th Independence Day, and we are standing in front of\nthe historic Red Fort which throughout modern history has been the symbol\nof our urge for Independence. From 1858 to the time when Gandhiji\nlaunched his non-violent movement and to the time when Netaji Subhash\nBose created an army, all Indians had but one desire to see the flag of\nindependent India flying on the Red Fort. And then 35 years ago\nJawaharlal Nehru for the first time unfurled our flag here. His connection\nwith the Red Fort had been established even earlier when he, together with\nother brave people of the country, had come forward in defence of the\npeople imprisoned at the Red Fort.\n       In a way, we can say that today is a day of tears for those millions\nwho fought and gave their lives in our struggle for freedom and those who\nstrove to safeguard this Independence. But this land is not a land of tears.\nToday is the day when we are proud of the fact that we did not let our\nvision become blurred because of tears, nor did we succumb to our\ninjuries. We have gone ahead, overcoming all dangers and difficulties,\nwhether in our struggle against alien rule, or in the struggle to safeguard\nour borders, or in the struggle that we are waging today against poverty,\neconomic backwardness and injustice. India has a tradition of overcoming\nits sorrows and marching forward with determination.\n       Today all of us-- the farmers, the labourers, the unemployed, the\nwomenfolk, the Scheduled Caste people and the backward classes, the\ntribal people-- all those who are still not fully within reach of the fruits of\nfreedom, and industrialization and modernity, all are together in this\nstruggle. If we have not been successful completely in our goals it is not\nbecause the desire was not there or the effort was not there, but because\nsuch gigantic tasks cannot be accomplished through magic or in a day. No\nmatter how high we set our goals and how hard we try, such things take\ntheir own time. But if we remain united and show the same determination\nthat we did during our struggle for Independence or that we do at times of\nexternal aggression, we can certainly make quicker progress in our battle\nagainst poverty.\n       But I am sad to say that this determination is not always manifest.\nWhen we were under alien rule they exploited our greatest weakness. They\ntried somehow or the other to create dissensions among us either in the\nname religion or on some other grounds. Thus they sought to sow the\nseeds of disunity and weaken our fight for Independence which we carried\non through peaceful means under the leadership of Gandhiji. But we did\nnot become victims of their machinations. There were occasional riots and\ndisturbances, but generally we progressed along our chosen path.\n        When we set forth on a journey, we come across all types of roads\nand paths. Some are wide, others are narrow and we have to select the\npath along which we want to move forward. There are not many ways open\nto a country like ours which was poverty-stricken and oppressed, at times\nbeset with fears. In fact, we have only one path open to us, the path of\nunity. We tried to create a society which would not fear oppression or\nsuccumb to suffering. There are many sitting before me who were born\nafter the advent of Independence and who cannot even imagine the\nhumiliations we had to go through and the poverty that prevailed. Today we\nstill have poverty in the country, but together with this the middle class has\ngrown in strength and in numbers too. There is some unemployment today\nbut many people have also gained opportunities for better employment.\nThe more we progress, the more such opportunities will increase.\n     Earlier, we had to stretch our hands to beg for food, but today we\nproduce enough food. But this is not enough. With the increase in\npopulation, we need more land for cultivation, more grains, more education,\nand more health services. Things which we could not even dream of\nearlier, have become necessities today for every person and every family.\nOur effort is to see that whatever little we have is so distributed that no one\nsuffers. People may have a little less but there should be no injustice.\n      Today, who are our enemies? It may be that we have external\nenemies and will have them in future, too. Then, like many other countries,\nwe have poverty and economic backwardness as our common enemy. But\nwhat was it that weakened India in the first place because of which we lost\nour Independence? The same thing exists today, which can, and is,\nweakening the country. It is divisiveness in the name of religion and\nlanguage, as also provincialism and casteism. I ask you, my brothers, my\nsisters and dear children, which country has been able to progress without\nunity and hard work? We want our defence forces to be strong. Why? Not\nto launch an attack on others, but to defend our own borders, to keep our\ncountry safe. We want that our industries should flourish, our agricultural\nproduction should grow, employment opportunities should increase, as also\nthe production of those goods which can help raise our living standards and\nprovide comfort and happiness.\n      We are a peace-loving nation and want that a peaceful atmosphere\nshould prevail not only in our country but in the entire world. But when will\nthis be possible! Only when rumour mongering and injustices are curbed.\nWe know that there are cases of injustice, oppression and corruption. But\nwhat is the way to overcome these? Can a weak government launch a\nstruggle against these forces? Can a government which itself is constantly\nunder attack, keep safe the interests of the poor and of the minorities? Can\na weak government build a country which can raise its head with pride in\nthe world? Today the time has come to create a strong government, a\nstrong nation. Of course, the time was always there but today this need is\nbeing felt all the more because dangers have increased all over the world.\nThe dangers and the difficulties which we, specially the poorer and the\neconomically backward nations, are trying to overcome, are existent more\nor less throughout the world.\n      Even the richest and the strongest of nations are facing the problems\nof unemployment and inflation. In those countries too the economic\nsituation is not satisfactory. I have had the opportunity of visiting many\ncountries. From other countries which I or my ministers have not been able\nto visit, we constantly receive reports. Today all countries are worried. And\nthe greatest worry is about the direction in which the human community is\nheading after having extended its limits of knowledge and ability. Are we\nheading for suicide and annihilation of this beautiful earth of ours? This is\nthe question which is facing more and more people today. In world capitals\nand important towns there is a movement on the subject and people are\nthinking, writing and speaking about it.\n      There are three big dangers. One is the amassing of the worst kinds\nof weapons which can destroy the human species, entire cities and lands.\nSecond, the gap between the rich and the poor nations continues to widen.\nThe gap between the rich and the poor exists in our country and in other\npoor countries also. This is a fact we do not seek to conceal. At least we\nare trying to establish a socialistic pattern of society and socialism itself\nmeans that this difference between the rich and the poor should diminish,\nthat equality should prevail in society and that the fruits of Independence\nshould reach each individual and every family. The third danger is that\nbecause of greed we continue to exploit the natural resources of the earth\nlike mining coal and extracting oil without giving a thought to what effect\nsuch acts will have on the coming generations.\n       We are proud of being Indians not because India is far more beautiful\nor better than other countries. Wherein then lies her greatness? What is\nthat inherent quality which has seen her flourish through centuries and\nages and which has given our poor people strength and capability? It is\nessentially the high ideals of our ancient tradition. Our country may have\nmade mistakes, but we have always set ourselves lofty goals. We have\nthought not merely in terms of India's unity but have viewed all issues in the\ncontext of humanity as a whole.\n     India has had a tradition of peace and tolerance: tolerance not only\ntowards fellow-men but even towards animals and plants. This has been\nour tradition, whether you look at the teachings of the Buddha or those of\nthe Sikh Gurus. You know how Emperor Asoka propagated his teachings of\npeace throughout the country and how Akbar brought together peoples of\ndifferent religions and profited from their teachings. Such things have given\nour country inherent strength.\n       Our Independence Day also coincides with the birth anniversary of\nSri Aurobindo. Where else in the world can you find the example of a\nrevolutionary believing in violence giving up the violent path and turning to\nspiritualism, all the while retaining his love for his country and seeking out\nways to increase the inherent strength and morale of the nation? Then\nthere was Gandhiji who assimilated the best of various religions and forged\nthe weapon of peace, friendship and a sense of brotherhood to fight for our\nIndependence. We were fighting our battle for Independence but not with\nguns and cannons. Our weapons were unity and patriotism, and our\ndedication and determination to achieve the goal. Have we lost these\nweapons today? Does that sense of patriotism exist no more? Are we no\nmore prepared to make sacrifices? I see many children sitting in front of\nme, and many young men must be listening at this moment to my voice. I\ncall\nupon all of them to join hands and be one in their patriotism to strengthen\nour nation. Those who exploit religion, caste, language and provincialism\nfor political gains do not have the welfare of the nation at heart. There are\npeople who imagine that progress can be achieved only through violence.\nThis gets their names into the newspapers and creates a little stir. But we\nhave to ask ourselves whether we want our names in print or we want to\nstrengthen the country and work for its progress. Now is the time for you to\nchoose your path. I am confident that our children, our elders who\nparticipated in the freedom struggle, and those who fought in times of\nexternal aggression, will give evidence of the old spirit of unity and\nstrength.\n       Today we have to reinforce the ancient values of India. We are\ncitizens of India and we should not do anything, say anything and even\nthink anything that lowers the prestige of Mother India. We all have a\ntremendous responsibility cast on us, not only towards ourselves but also\ntowards future generations. India is not a country which has been in\nexistence for five or ten or a 100 years. Her history goes back to thousands\nof years and it will continue to exist for thousands more. If we have to make\nsacrifices today for the sake of a better future, I call upon you to make\nthose sacrifices and render the necessary services. I have full confidence\nthat no matter what ideology we subscribe to, and whatever political or\nother differences we may have, we will all be one when it comes to being\nsoldiers for India. We do not don uniforms. We respect those who do and\nwe take pride in them. But we too are soldiers, no less, in the fight for\nIndia's progress. With this in view, I once again entreat you to stand united,\nto remain strong, and overcome difficulties with a cheer and a smile. We\nwant our beautiful country to be even more beautiful, and should cleanse it\nof all dirt whether it is the dirt in the street, the dirt in our houses or in our\nhearts. Everybody has to voluntarily accept his own responsibility. We have\na habit of blaming others. Let each one of us ask ourselves whether we are\ndoing the right thing or not and whether we are prepared to exert ourselves\nto the utmost to check those who are doing the wrong things. If the\nhumblest of our citizens, and also the most important, think about these\nproblems, realize their own responsibilities and change accordingly, will not\nthe entire society change, and with this, will not the entire nation change?\nThis is a question which every one of us has to address to his own heart.\n      I once again felicitate you on this happy day and call upon you to be\nprepared for every suffering, every risk and every obstacle so that we can\nbring about a united India which can hold its head high in the community of\nnations."},{"year":1981,"pm":"Indira Gandhi","party":"INC","title":"Call for Unity, Discipline and Hard Work","footnote":"Free rendering of the Independence Day speech delivered in Hindi from the Red Fort, Delhi, August 15, 1981","source":"Selected Speeches of Indira Gandhi: January 1980-December 1981","text":"Today again is the birthday of Free India. I greet you all. We come\nhere every year to unfurl the flag. This is no mere ritual or custom; it is a\nduty.\n       This is the day when we recall those years when people of all\nreligions, all castes, all languages, all States, rich and poor, women and\nmen, old and young, were all one and united. What was our slogan? 'We\nmay lose our head but India must become free'. To achieve this goal we did\nnot care for the insults and humiliations inflicted on us, and, put into our\nfreedom struggle all our physical, material and moral resources. Many\nfamilies were ruined, many lakhs of people sacrificed their lives and many\njails were filled. In this Red Fort itself, there were prisoners who had\npassed through the jaws of death. There is no village in India which does\nnot have its own saga of courage and bravery of its people. Today, we\nremember all that and pay our homage to those freedom fighters whether\nthey were in our peaceful and non-violent movement or whether they\nfollowed other paths. Today we have to tell these old accounts of freedom\nstruggle specially to our younger generation, because it is from that seed\nthat the New India is sprouting. The plant is still frail, we have to nurse it\nwith our sweat and hard labour, and with all the care make it grow just as\nwe plant trees to make India green.\n      I had spoken from this place a year ago. During this year, like in other\nyears, you have faced many difficulties. Your problems are known to me\nand I view them not only as a Prime Minister but also as a woman and a\nmother. But, if there were problems and difficulties- and they exist also-\nthere were successes and achievements too. APPLE, which was\ninaugurated yesterday, is one such achievement. For the first time, through\nthis satellite APPLE, not only those who are present here but lakhs of\nothers in different parts of the country are able to listen and watch today's\nfunction and thus participate in it. This is not a small achievement for a\nnation which only a few years back was enmeshed in the mire of\ncolonialism.\n      You may ask that if we can perform such big tasks for which we are\nall proud and happy and congratulate our scientists and engineers, why is it\nthat we do not accomplish other lesser jobs? Why cannot we control\nprices? This is a moot question. The prices are still high and I know the\ndifficulties you face, specially my sisters who have to run the homes. I\nwould, however, like to tell you that though prices have not come down, the\nrate of increase in prices has certainly been controlled to some extent and\nthe situation is improving gradually. There are many reasons for the rise in\nprices. One is less production and we are engaged in increasing it. But\nanother reason is-- we have some selfish people in our country, as\nelsewhere also, who try to take advantage out of such problems. In trying\nto satisfy their self-interest, they forget the overall interest of the country.\nEven today, hoarding, blackmarketing and profiteering are going on,\nbecause those who indulge in these anti-social activities had received\nencouragement a few years back and have still not come into our net.\nAlthough in some areas there has been some impact of the action taken by\nus, it is still not as much as it should have been. People demand from us as\nto why we do not take stern measures. But, if we try to take even slight stiff\nsteps, so many obstacles come in the way. Some steps have been taken\nand these have had some effect; more such measures will certainly be\ntaken against the anti-social elements.\n      Some shortages occurred because of the nature and the weather and\nsometimes even because of our mistakes. However, we are making an all\nout effort to increase production. In fact, agricultural production has gone\nup. As you all know, agricultural production this year has been exceedingly\ngood. You may ask: If wheat production has gone up, why are we importing\nwheat? This is because here, in the country, an effort is being made by\nsome people to purchase and hoard it with a view to raising the prices later.\nThis may cause suffering to many people, especially the poorest or those\nwho live in remote areas. This is why, even though we did not need it\nimmediately, we made the purchase as wheat was available easily and at\nlow prices abroad. As one should be prepared all the time to face\nproblems, we took this step so that we may protect our people from\ndifficulties.\n     There has been increase in industrial production also. Our emphasis\nhas been to improve the infrastructure on which depends all production,\nprogress and development, whether of the farmers or of the factories.\nThere has thus been growth in energy, coal and rail transport system\nthough we have not been able to accomplish all that is needed.\n      In these years, there has been considerable improvement in social\nservices like health, education and others. Even then it is not enough and\nwe cannot reach them to the people. Why? Because, while these services\nincrease, our population increases at a still faster rate. So, whatever may\nbe the number of new schools, colleges and universities, and, howsoever\nmany new hospitals and dispensaries are opened, the number of people\nwho need them is always more.\n       Whether it is a question of inflation or population or any other\nquestion, the job cannot be completed unless there is fullest co-operation\nfrom all of you. The Government has heavy responsibility which, through\nyour vote, you have entrusted it with; but in a democracy the ordinary\ncitizen also has an equal amount of duties. The atmosphere gets vitiated if\npeople are spendthrift and keep on buying things whatever may be the\nprice and whether they need a thing or not. I would even say that in these\ndifficult times anyone who acts against the interest of the society acts\nagainst the nation. How to check these elements? Laws and rules are\nmade but they cannot always be fully implemented because it is not for the\ngovernment alone to implement them. At different levels, many people\ncontribute to complete this work and the slightest lapse anywhere can\ndislocate the entire programme and the policy. We want your co-operation\nin this also. I do not mean in the least that you take law in your hands. I\nwant to say that you should create such an atmosphere in the society that\npeople who want to do wrong things are not able to prosper and are\nidentified and made to feel ashamed before others. If you create such an\natmosphere, you will see how quickly the situation can be reformed.\n       Whatever we do now, like this purchase of wheat from abroad, some\npeople raise their voices against it. Who are behind them? Voices are\nraised by people because they are provoked to do so by others. What are\nthe forces behind them? It is these forces that want that the prices of\nfoodgrains should go up in the market, not that the farmers should get a\nhigher price.\n       There are many such things which either get stuck in the courts or\nsome other obstacles come in the way, because of which they remain\nunresolved and get delayed. We have to create a new atmosphere in our\nsociety so that everybody may understand his duties. Like the freedom\nfighters I just mentioned, all of you have also to act as soldiers to safeguard\nthe freedom. You have to involve yourself in this task with the same spirit of\nsacrifice and service. This is not someone else's work, not of any\nGovernment or of any political party only. This is the work of the country, of\nthe common citizen of India, of the poor, of the backward, of the middle\nclass, in fact, of all the people. In the conditions of today some people may\nearn profits, but if the country does not become strong, they will not benefit\nfrom profits for long; they will not be able to remain happy for long. We\nhave to keep all these matters in view.\n       In today's world, not only in our country but in other countries also,\nwherever I have gone or where others have gone and have described the\nsituation, we find there is violence, crime and lawlessness everywhere. We\nare not concerned with what happens in other countries, although it does\ninfluence the situation here. We have to see that we bring about\nimprovement in our own attitudes. We should spread our own humanism\nand bring back again basic moral values in the society, which is the\nfoundation of all religions, from which not only we, in India, but I think, the\nentire humanity has departed to take a wrong road. With all this wisdom,\nknowledge and capability, instead of using it for good causes, how is this\npower being used? We see that big powers are using their resources not in\ndevelopment work, not in helping the poor, but in increasing their\narmaments - bigger and bigger and more sophisticated ones. What for? For\nthe annihilation of people, or, destruction of houses, farms and fields or\nnations. This is being done knowingly by the human race. Is it the path\nIndia should follow? Time has come when every Indian must consider this\nmatter in depth and understand his responsibility.\n       Before we tell others anything, we have to set things right in our own\nhome. In this country where peace used to prevail, where people always\nlived together amicably — though sometimes small quarrels take place why\ndo disturbances take place on petty matters, sometimes in the name of\nlanguages? These are the things which come in the way of our progress\nand development. We have to remove these from our path. If there is any\ncause behind it we have to find it and root it out. We have to create an\natmosphere in which no impediment comes in the way of our development\nand progress. This is the message of our Independence Day, this year and\nevery year.\n      We have reached one stage in our progress, but the journey is still\nvery long. Stockpile of armaments is increasing all around us, posing\nincreasing danger not only to India but to the entire region and, I think, to\nthe whole world. When there is danger, everybody suffers but burden falls\nmore on those who are poor and have shortage of resources, commodities,\nmoney or the like. Therefore, while others have to be vigilant anyway, we\nIndians have to be more vigilant and alert.\n       We have to give a new direction to our society. We have to learn\nmany things from our history and heritage. If there are superstitions or\nother evils, we should not have the least hesitation to remove them. We\nhave to develop our own strength. Everyone has his share of problems and\ndifficulties, individuals as well as countries. You all know what I have\nsuffered as a mother, but, for me much bigger is my duty towards you who\nare like my children. And, that is why these things can hold back neither me\nnor you. Time waits for none. Our children are growing, whether you help\nthem or not. Their's and other people's demands are increasing, and rightly\nso, because if some people are getting things, why not the others — the\npoor and the backward.\n     At this time, all of us must develop the feelings of unity and strength.\nWe have always strived for friendship with our neighbouring countries and\nothers. But, when they spurned and attacked us, we did face the\naggression with courage. And, I congratulate and express gratefulness\nagain on your behalf to our jawans and officers of the Defence Forces for\nthe way in which they kept our borders secure, and, I know they will\ncontinue to do so. But our effort is that there should be no war; there should\nbe friendship with our neighbours and with far-off countries. Nobody need\nconsider it as our weakness. It is not because of any weakness; we do it for\nthe sake of our ideals. It is our effort that those ideals should guide our\ncountry.\n      It is our policy that all regions of the country should progress and\ndevelop — including the hill regions, the desert areas and the people living\nin the forests. In the Five Year Plan, there are schemes for everyone —\nfarmers, workers, students, harijans, adivasis, poor people and those\nbelonging to middle class. Millions of new opportunities for employment will\nopen up for people and I have confidence that our youth will take full\nadvantage of them. They will also, I am sure, find new avenues for\nself-employment. It has been our constant effort to push forward schemes\nthat are beneficial to the farmers and the workers.\n       There was some misunderstanding because recently an Ordinance\nwas issued which prevents strikes in essential public services. I want to\nassure the workers that this Ordinance is not against them. It has never\nbeen our intention and we will never do anything to suppress them or\ncreate difficulties for them in any way. But it is necessary that the public\nservices are kept going, not because that these are governmental\nprogrammes, but because it is in the interest of the good of the country.\nThese things are required by the common man, and are needed for the\nstrength and security of the nation. Workers have always discharged their\nresponsibilities and I have confidence that they and our farmers, our\nintellectuals and other sections will continue to discharge their\nresponsibilities.\n      Today is a special day, being Raksha-Bandhan. This is not a religious\nfestival. It is a social festival for cordiality and for friendship. This is the day\nwhen people extend their hands of friendship. What for? For protecting\neach other. On this day we seek the co-operation of all countries in\nmaintaining peace and in protecting the humanity. To our own countrymen,\nwe say that they should celebrate this day not only in the manner of\nbrother-sister relationship but see how they can protect Mother india, how\nthe unity in the country could be further strengthened and how each\nindividual can be a protector of the nation.\n       Earlier, I had told you about a slogan. Now I want to say that the flag\nunder which we are standing is not just a piece of cloth. This is a symbol of\nthe sacrifices made in our struggle for freedom, later, of the sacrifices by\nour brave soldiers on our borders in various wars, and now of those who\nwith their hard labour are engaged in the struggle for India's progress, and\nalso of our promising youth. Our flag and our National Anthem are no\nordinary things. They unite the country and bind it together. That is why I\nwant to say that 'the glory of the flag must be protected even at the cost of\nlife'."},{"year":1980,"pm":"Indira Gandhi","party":"INC","title":"At a Turning Point","footnote":"Free rendering of the Independence Day speech delivered in Hindi from the Red Delhi, August 15, 1980","source":"Selected Speeches of Indira Gandhi: January 1980-December 1981","text":"After a few years I have again the privilege to unfurl our dear national\nflag from this historic place.\n      This should have been an occasion for rejoicing, but my heart is full\nof sorrow. The incident which has taken place in Moradabad, not very far\nfrom here, has inflicted an injury to our country. Our sympathies are with\nthe families of all those who have died or have been injured or have\nsuffered in some way. On behalf of all of you I offer my sympathies to them.\nI should like to say that whoever has played mischief or is guilty, whether\nhe is an official or a non-official, will be very severely punished. At the\nsame time, I urge upon you that we should not allow the feeling of\ncommunalism, casteism or of revenge to spread.\n      It is the duty of everyone, in every city or village, to use all our energy\nto maintain peace and law and order. The poison of communalism has\nbeen there in our society for many years. We had thought that the\nmartyrdom of Gandhiji had eliminated this poison but we see how easily it\nbursts out again.\n       You know that from my childhood I have been taught that special\nattention should be given to the weaker sections in our country- whether\nthey are weak because of their numbers or because of poverty and\nbackwardness. Our first duty is to protect them, help them and to raise\nthem up, because only then can there be peace in our society. We have all\nto get on to this task. We have to think why these things, which had been\ncontrolled or were in check, have again emerged, particularly during the\nlast three years. Besides communalism, casteism has surfaced in a\npowerful manner. There must be some conspiracy and some kind of effort\nthat on every issue there is some agitation or some clash or violence, so\nthat no work is done.\n       Violence and lawlessness have spread all over the country. If we do\nnot succeed in putting a stop to it, we shall not be able to accomplish\nanything. It is like a river which breaks its banks and overflows in every\ndirection. Its water then can be of little use or beneficence. It can only\ncause harm to the people. Such is the present state of affairs. Such groups\nwere encouraged and a climate was created in the country so that no could\ngrab anything they could get.\n     We know that in a poor and backward country everybody has\ndemands to make. Some of these can be just demands, the people need\nthose things. But the question is how the demands should be put forward.\nCan agitatations, which impose burdens on others, take our country\nforward? And if the country cannot march forward, then how can the\ndemands be satisfied?\n      We have to stop this lawlessness. We have to remove the\nweaknesses that have crept in at every level, not only among the youth, but\nin the entire society and in the administration.\n      We find that the discipline, the spirit of working together, the spirit of\nmarching together, the spirit of sacrifice and the spirit of service which were\nthere earlier have disappeared now. People say that so many months have\ngone by but nothing has been done, but when water is spilt, can it again be\ncollected easily? I assure you that it is my earnest endeavour to bring about\nimprovement in the administration so that it may accomplish its tasks with\ndedication, patriotism, courage and speed.\n       Corruption has gone up and I am amazed at the extent of its increase\nat every level. We must root it out, whether it is in bureaucracy or in politics,\nwhether it is in high places or low. Whoever it may be, we have to check\nthis vigorously so that the instruments for implementing our policies are\nsharpened and take our programmes forward.\n      One of our main tasks is to see how to strengthen the services,\nwhose duty it is to protect society. They should be enabled to do their work\nbetter and win the confidence and friendship of the people.\n     We are not unaware of the difficulties which we are facing today.\nThere is the problem of Assam, where a powerful agitation has been going\non.\n     I regard the children and students of Assam as my own children. I\nhave sympathy for them. It is our earnest effort to remove their difficulties\nwhich are genuine and have substance. But I would also tell them that it is\nnot correct to hold the country to ransom and cause suffering to the nation.\nI believe that there are some sections, small in number but determined to\ndo mischief, who want to take undue advantage of this agitation or for that\nmatter any agitation anywhere else.\n       At some places, anti-social elements come to the surface; at others,\nanti-national elements raise their heads. If this evil, this poison, however\nsmall, is not combated it can spread and cause great damage. I have no\ndoubt that the people of Assam and other parts of the country will not allow\nthis poison to spread and will bravely fight the evil forces, agitation or no\nagitation.\n      Prices have risen and I know fully well the agonies of our people,\nparticularly the difficulties and burdens on housewives and on women. But\nyou also know the reasons why prices have gone up.\n      The prices of some commodities like oil, diesel and fertilizers are not\nwholly in our hands. But there are other commodities the prices of which\nshould be under check. But how can the prices come down if there are\nagitations, if so much of money has to be spent on maintaining law and\norder and on fulfilling the demands of some sections of the people?\n      I appeal to you all, to the entire society, to sisters and brothers, to old\nand young, to realize that they also have some responsibility in the matter.\nOf course, it is the responsibility of the traders at this time not to take\nadvantage of the difficulties and the helplessness of the people. It is also\nthe responsibility of the people not to buy non-essential goods. Each in his\nown way should see what he can do in this direction.\n       If something improper is being done, if the ration shop is not being\nrun properly, or if the traders are raising prices without reason, people\nshould see what they can do. I can assure them that the government will\nfully co-operate with them in this task. But unless there is full backing of the\npeople, this rampant evil cannot be easily curbed.\n      At the same time there is no problem which we cannot solve if you\nhelp and co-operate. If we had recorded some achievements earlier, it was\nnot because of any outside support, but because of the support and\nco-operation you gave us. We were able to consolidate the nation's power\nand did not allow it to be frittered away. You and we were thus able to\nachieve some remarkable things.\n     If agricultural production or industrial production increased, it was\nbecause of the sweat and labour of the Indian people. Today, we have\nagain to revive the spirit of working hard.\n      The farmers of India are our very backbone. The country cannot\nsurvive without them, nor can we achieve self-reliance.\n      Cultivators are today in distress because of rising prices and the\nshortage of some inputs. We are trying our best to help them in every\npossible way.\n      After the terrible drought of last year, the rains have been fairly good\nso far this year. This has brought some relief. But many people have\nsuffered because of floods. I offer my sympathies to the flood-affected\npeople.\n      We have to increase the agriculture production in all possible ways so\nthat our needs are met and foodgrains and other essential commodities are\ntaken to the people in remote areas, whether they live in mountains, in\nforests or in deserts.\n      Similarly, industrial workers constitute the foundation of a modern\nnation. We can help our agriculture and strengthen the country only if our\nfactories are kept running and industrial production goes up.\n      Our problems are many. But India is not the only country which faces\nan economic crisis. It is a world-wide phenomenon. Even the bigger nations\nare facing all the problems that we face. But this is no excuse for us.\n       No single country or a group of countries can help us. We have got to\nstand on our own feet and march towards the goal of self-reliance. And I\nthink that one of the major causes of the lack of discipline and selfishness\nthat we see around us is that we have given up the tried and tested path\nduring the last three years. Our basic policies and objectives and our ideals\nwhich had inspired us to march forward were repudiated and new ways\nwere sought out. We would have understood if they did find a new way, but\nthey went in different directions. This was the reason why all those who had\ncome together broke up and our speed slowed down.\n       Wherever there is poverty and backwardness, internal danger is\nalways present; but, today there is external danger also. You are not\nunaware of the state of affairs around our country, of the massive arms\nbuild-up that it going on. Earlier, the danger came only from one or two\ndirections; but today the vast ocean is also full of all kinds of military\nconcentrations. So the peril to us has further aggravated.\n      Our policy has always been that of friendship and it will continue to be\nso. We extend our hand of friendship, especially towards our neighbouring\ncountries. The Government and the people of India know very well that\nnothing comes out of confrontation. It is only through co-operation and\nfriendship that everyone can solve problems and help each other.\n      Whosoever tries to weaken us, puts pressure on us or is hostile to us.\nwe shall face them unitedly, not through weapons, not through war, but on\nthe basis of our strength, our stability, our unity and our ideals.\n       It has been our desire to show to the world that the countries of the\nentire sub-continent and those outside can live together and work together.\nBut again, there is confrontation between countries. As I said earlier, no\none can help a country as large as India. We have to stand on our own\nfeet. Any help can at best be marginal. If we fall, nobody can lift us. We\nhave to rise ourselves.\n      Our country can ensure its security on its own. It cannot depend on\nothers. This is why we lean neither towards this country nor that, neither\ntowards this bloc nor that bloc.\n      We are Indians and India is our concern. The building up of India is\nour endeavour. Whatever is our policy, whatever is our direction and\nwhatever steps or programmes we undertake, they are all designed only to\nmake the people of India strong and to raise them above poverty and\nbackwardness. This is our only objective.\n      I wish to assure our neighbouring countries that our people desire\nfriendship with them. We do not want war. We know that there cannot be\nagreement on everything. There are bound to be differences among\nnations as among individuals. But wherever there is similarity of views, we\nshould help each other, work together and co-operate with each other. If\nwe are prepared to do that, much of our expenditure could be cut down and\nwe can become stronger. But if anybody threatens us, we are prepared for\nit.\n       Present here amidst us today are the brave jawans of our three\nServices. No praise is too high for them. They are constantly engaged in\nthe service of people, whether in war or peace. We, the citizens of India,\nare also soldiers of a kind, whether we put on a uniform or not. It is our duty\nto further strengthen our defence forces through unity among ourselves.\n      I see before me a large number of children, the hope and promise of\nIndia. What kind of future do we want to build for them? We have to work\ntoday for that future. If our young men, our farmers and workers, our\nmiddle-class and housewives and people of other professions get lost in\nthe worries of the day and cannot come out of the present day crisis, how\nshall we march forward and complete the journey?\n        More than 28 crore people of our country were born after\nIndependence. They have no conception of the appalling poverty that\nexisted in India before Independence, the insults and indignities which were\ninflicted upon Indian citizens, our religion and our culture. Almost a\nmiraculous change has taken place during these years.\n      All our problems have not been solved but, one by one, many\nproblems have also been set right. If your co-operation is forthcoming,\nmany more will be solved.\n     When our Government was formed, I had said, “Let us forget what\nhappened in the past. Let us again be united.” We may have different\npolicies and cannot adopt identical programmes. At the same time, no\nobstacles should be created in the way of building up of the nation.\n      Democracy can function only when the Government and the\nOpposition parties accept each other and try to work in harmony. This does\nnot mean that the Opposition has no right to oppose. That right is inherent\nin a democracy. But no attempt should be made to stop the functioning of\nthe Government.\n      Who suffers—the Government or the people—when work stops? And\nwhen the people suffer, the worst hit are the poor, particularly the women.\nWho will suffer if the schools and colleges are closed? Certainly the\nchildren whose years of education are wasted. We should consider all this.\n      We are at a turning point in the life of our country. Either we gain all\nor we lose all. Of course, it is the responsibility of the Government to\nimplement programmes but it is equally up to the Opposition parties and\nalso to you who are citizens of India. We should understand these\nproblems.\n      During our freedom struggle, we marched forward unitedly and in a\ndisciplined fashion. We had then no thought of our own selves, nor of our\ndemands. Were there no demands then? Was there no agony or suffering\nwhen we were fighting for independence? There were few employment\nopportunities in those days. Availability of goods was meagre, people were\npushed around and there was discrimination against us in our own\nrailways. But Gandhiji turned all the suppressed and illiterate people into a\nstrong force which shook the entire world. That power is still within us. Only\na fraction of that power is represented at the Red Fort today and the rest—\nthe vast masses of the people are spread in the four corners of the country.\n      We are a powerful force, a force for culture, a force for wisdom of the\nkind hardly seen in any other country. Shall we fritter away this asset? We\nhave a precious heritage. Shall we throw it away? We have to consider all\nthis.\n      Our goal is to make India great. We want to make India strong. We\ndo not ask for anything from the world. All we seek is peace. All we seek is\nto strengthen our freedom. All we want is to establish true democracy in our\ncountry— democracy not for the few but for the poorest of the poor, so that\ntheir problems are solved, so that they can have two full meals a day and\nbe usefully employed and preserve their self-respect.\n       It is these things we want for our country. Only when we are able to\nprovide these things can we say that the vow which our leaders had taken,\nthe pledge Jawaharlal Nehru took for the first time at this spot under this\nflag, has been fulfilled.\n      Independence, the dream which Gandhiji shared with us and said we\nshould do or die to reach it, has been realized. But we have to go ahead. If\nwe stand together, there is no task which we cannot accomplish, no\nproblem that we cannot solve and no danger that we cannot face.\n     I call upon you once again to rise and march ahead. We have fallen\ndown sometimes, we may fall down again, but we shall rise and move\nforward and reach our destination.\n      Brothers and sisters, I appeal to you again to look to the future and\nnot to the present. The future of India, your future, is bright and shining.\nSometimes its very glitter can dazzle our vision, but we have to move\nforward to that glorious future and raise our country to a much higher plane."},{"year":1979,"pm":"Charan Singh","party":"Janata Party","title":"Pledge to go ahead","footnote":"Independence Day speech from the ramparts of the Red Fort, New Delhi, 15 August 1979","source":"Charan Singh, selected speeches, July 1979-December 1979","text":"We are today celebrating the thirty second anniversary of our\nIndependence. It was through the sacrifice and endeavour of Mahatma\nGandhi and other leaders that the country won its Independence after 200\nyears of British rule. On this occasion, it is proper that we pay our homage\nto the Father of the Nation and other colleagues. However, just paying\nhomage will not be enough.\n       The recent change in the Central Government was brought about in a\npeaceful and democratic manner. A variety of things are said by people in\nthis regard. They say this is an SVD Government and ask how will it run?\nBut I would like to tell you that the Janata Government also was an SVD\nGovernment. It had one label and yet it was an SVD Government with\nmany constituents. I would not go into details but would only mention that\nsome persons tried to discard the ladder with the help of which they had\nstepped up to the seat of power. I had publicly expressed my disagreement\nwith my closest ally, Shri Raj Narain, on 24th of June. But the events that\ntook place after that forced me and my colleagues to leave that SVD\nGovernment. Today, the Congress, the Janata (S) and our friends in the\nSocialist Party, the Peasants and Workers Party of Maharashtra and the\nCommunist Party members, who had expressed themselves in favour of\nthis Government in the last week of July, together have a strength of 200\nand more; call it SVD or what you like. The day, the other people or the\nparties or leaders are able to form a larger party and challenge us and the\nmoment we feel that we are in a minority, we will not hesitate even for a\nminute to step down.\n      I and my colleagues do not want a mid-term poll which is very\nexpensive and creates lot of problems. But I think, no party wants a\nmid-term poll. If, however, we have to go in for one, we will come to you to\nseek your vote and confidence. I have every hope that in that event, the\nCongress, the Janata(S) and other partners, I have mentioned, will be able\nto form a united party which will be able to secure majority throughout the\ncountry.\n     Among the number of problems facing this country, the most serious\nis poverty. Of the 125 nations of the world, our position is 111th which\nmeans that there are 110 countries which are more affluent than us. Three\nyears ago, our position was 104th and during this period we have slided\ndown to the 111th position. This speaks of the level of our poverty.\n      The second problem is of unemployment. From the time the Janata\nParty took up the reins of power, 25 lakh more young unemployed have\nregistered their names with the Employment Exchanges. Unemployment\nthus is on the increase. In the rural areas, both the educated and\nuneducated are unemployed. In the cities too, the educated unemployed\nare on the streets. Therefore, we have to eradicate unemployment.\n       The third problem, we face in the economic field is the growing\ndisparity between the poor and the affluent. This disparity existed even at\nthe time of the British. In a small measure, this disparity exists everywhere\nand it will be impossible to erase it completely. But that Government alone\nwill be considered good which minimises this disparity instead of letting it\nincrease further. Since Independence, in our country the gap between the\nrich and the poor has increased and economic power is getting\nconcentrated in the hands of a few people.\nBesides, social tensions also persist. I would not like to go into the reasons\nfor this. But the poor, the Harijans and the weaker sections are not feeling\nsecure. The minorities, that is the followers of religions other than Hindu,\nhave also begun to sense similar tension. The reasons may be historic and\nneed not be elaborated just now. It will be the endeavour of this\nGovernment to eliminate the root causes of these continuing tensions and\nestablish peace and prosperity in the country. We will be deemed to have\nsucceeded only if no communal riots are reported for one year or for the\ntenure of this Government.\n      Friends, one immediate problem before us is price rise. In the last two\nFive Year Plans, investment for cement, coal and power production was\nmeagre and in the last six months of the Janata Government, that is from\nJanuary to June 1979, these sectors were handled indifferently. Coal,\npower, rail movement are critical sectors which have an impact on the total\neconomy. In addition, there have been strikes and ships held-up at ports\nunloaded for as long as one month and even 45 days. The result of all this\nhas been the rise in price level. This Government and my colleagues in the\nDepartments will make every effort to see that production increases. They\nwill not be confining themselves to Delhi, they will go to the power plants\nand to the coal mines.\n      As long as production does not increase and the prices keep going\nup, this country will never be able to progress.\n      Another thing to be noted is that the prices of even such commodities\nas foodgrains etc., which are not in short supply are also increasing. In this\nconnection I would appeal to the retail and wholesale traders that they\nshould desist from being greedy and earning profits which will only hurt our\npeople and our country. We are determined not to allow black-marketing\nand profiteering that has continued so far; we will not permit it to continue\nfurther.\n      Friends, all of us know which sections of our people deserve\nGovernment help most. But before I go into that, I would like to tell that\ndespite the rise in prices of certain commodities, we are not short of food\ngrains; our warehouses are full and for that, we should be grateful to the\nfarmers. The farmers will continue to work hard, even if the rainfall is scanty\nor there is no rain. Therefore, so far as foodgrains are concerned, the\ncountry will not face any shortage. Another silver lining is that we have no\nshortage of foreign exchange and this can help us import things needed by\nthe country.\n      I was referring to the sections which deserve greater attention from\nthe Government— the harijans, the tribals, the landless, the unemployed or\nunderemployed and 50 percent of our farmers who have got an hectare or\nless of land. These poorer sections have so far been neglected and the\nGovernment will pay special attention to them. According to the latest\nestimates of the Planning Commission, 48 percent of those living below the\npoverty line are in the villages and 41 percent in the towns. These are the\nones, who do not get even frugal meals to feed themselves. You can ask a\nquestion as to why there is hunger when our silos are full of foodgrains.\nThe reason is that they do not have the purchasing power. Even if there is\nplenty of food around, a man will remain hungry if he does not have the\nmoney to buy it. Therefore, the Government will pay the utmost attention to\nthe poor and the hungry, 41 percent of whom live behind the big palaces\nand bungalows in the cities and 48 percent of whom live in the villages. If\nwe can not give them the attention they deserve, the Government will not\nbe fit to remain in power.\n      It will be our endeavour that everyone in the country finds\nemployment. For this, we have to pay special attention for increasing\nagricultural production and establishing cottage and village industries.\nWhen the Britisher's came here first, 25 percent of our population was\nengaged in such industries. Today, despite big plants and factories, only 9\npercent of the population is engaged in industries. Therefore, despite lakhs\nof cars and large number of skyscrapers in Bombay and Delhi and the\nnumber of people who have televisions and radio sets, I feel that we are\ntoday, poorer and weaker than the time of Jahangir and Aurangzeb.\n       To my friends in the cities, I would say that I am not inclined to\nanswer the criticism appearing in the newspapers or the comments that\nvarious people make. I would like to say only that trade, transport and\nindustries can develop only when there is purchasing power with the\npeople. If the villagers, the unemployed and the poor do not have the\npurchasing power, our industries will not be able to develop and the country\nwill not be able to attain affluence. Only that country is considered affluent\nwhich has a larger percentage of people engaged in non-agricultural\noccupations. In our country, however, only 10 percent of the population\nwas engaged in industries in 1951 and this percentage remained static in\n1961 and again in 1971. Industry cannot grow unless agriculture also\ndevelops. There is no other way. We will, therefore, attempt to encourage\ncottage and village industries in the rural areas.\n      Our womenfolk today break stones on the roads. What were their\nforefathers engaged in? They were independently engaged in small\nindustries or were craftsmen. These crafts were lost during the time of\nBritish and we too continue to be indifferent in this respect. Our emphasis,\ntherefore, will be to establish cottage industries in the villages. We will also\nstrive to increase farm production. It will also be our endeavour to assist the\nrural people to diversify to other occupations because prosperity cannot be\nachieved if majority of our people continue to depend on land.\n      I would like to draw your attention as well as the attention of my\ncolleagues and public workers to the teachings of Mahatma Gandhi.\nMahatmaji used to say that “ends don't justify means\". It is as though you\ncan adopt any means to achieve your objectives, howsoever noble. To be\nable to achieve noble objectives, your means should also be equally noble.\nYou, and especially the public workers and all of us should keep in mind\nthis advice; otherwise we will not be able to root out corruption. Corruption\nknows no bounds. A country where people are corrupt, will never be able to\nprogress whosoever may be the leader of the party or whatever be the\nsound programme he might follow.\n       Mahatmaji also used to say that for a public worker, there is no\nprivate life different from his public life. To him, life is one and there is no\ncompartmentalisation. If man's public life is not clean, you can well imagine,\nhis private life cannot be any better either and he cannot truely serve the\ncountry.\n      The third thing, Gandhiji always emphasised and which we have\ntended to forget, is that \"rights flow out of duties well performed”. All\naround, you will find people asserting their rights, their demands to secure\nbetter wages and allowances. This is all right. It is necessary that people\nshould have their rights but their rights emerge from their duties and\nresponsibilities. How do we get our rights if we do not carry out our duties?\nThere is need for hard work and enterprise. If you want to be prosperous,\nyou will have to put in hard work. You will pardon me, if I say that we are\nnot prepared to put in hard work. If you look at the other countries, you will\ngo that people start working in their factories, schools and offices at 8 in the\nmorning till 5 in the evening, getting a break of 40 minutes in between.\nThere are very few strikes. The emphasis there on demands is much less.\nIn Japan, if a worker is annoyed, he only bears a black band on his arm\nand does not think in terms of striking work.\n       If other countries have become prosperous, it is because they have\nshown greater endeavour and enterprise. We want to earn more, have all\nthe comforts and enjoy life without having to pay the price for it, without\nwhich nothing really in this world can be obtained, either by a person or by\na nation. If the West today is more affluent, if Japan and Israel where the\ncows living in arid land, still give the world's best milk yield, are prosperous,\nit is because of the hard work and enterprise of these countries. If our\ncountry is to progress, we will have to put in hard work and show enterprise\nand when I say that, I include myself and my ministers. Only through our\nceaseless hard work will this country be able to advance.\n      Coming to the foreign policy, we continue to adhere to the old policy\nof not aligning ourselves with any particular bloc. This will continue to be\nour policy because we consider it to be beneficial to the country— we will\nnot be particularly inclined towards any country however big it might be. We\nbelieve that in the world peace can be achieved and people can find\nhappiness only by following the preachings of Mahatma Gandhi. If not\ntoday, the world will reach same conclusion the day after tomorrow.\n       So far as the countries of South Asia are concerned, our relations\nwith them have improved, barring some cases, where too, we hope, there\nwill be improvement in our relations.\n      In this connection I would like to mention our neighbour, Pakistan\nwhose people, till the other day, were part of us. Our information is that\nPakistan is trying to manufacture nuclear bomb. Against whom are they\nmaking this bomb? They are friends with China; and with Russia they have\nno disputes. As for Afghanistan, it is a small country and Pakistan has no\ndisputes with it either. If, therefore, I and my colleagues as also my\ncountrymen reach the conclusion that this bomb is aimed at us, is aimed at\nIndia, then our conclusion will not be far from the truth.\n      It has been our decision and it remains our decision so far that we do\nnot want to manufacture nuclear bombs, or join the race for nuclear\nweapons. However, if Pakistan sticks to its decision and continues in its\nefforts to manufacture the bomb or stockpiling of these bombs, I and my\ncolleagues will probably be forced to reconsider the entire question.\n     With these words, I would like to appeal all those democratic forces,\nwho believe in secularism, to cast aside their petty differences, and come\nforward to help me and my colleagues and my Government."},{"year":1978,"pm":"Morarji Desai","party":"Janata Party","title":"A New Revolution","source":"Prime Ministers of India's Independence Day and Other Speeches (Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru to Dr. Manmohan Sing), Vol 1. Edited by K.V. Singh. Vista International Publishing House, Delhi, India","text":"Sixteen months have passed since the people gave the mandate to\nthe Janata Party to run the government. Last year when I addressed you\non the same day, I had spoken about the problems facing the country and\nthe tasks ahead. During the last one year from August 15, many things\nhave happened and are happening at home and abroad. The first task was\nto restore the freedom of every citizen, the freedom of the press and the\nindependence of the judiciary. This has been done. These freedoms have\nbeen restored. I have every faith that they will remain inviolate. It is\nnecessary that the people should be fearless, strong and dedicated, and\nshould do everything with the good of the country in mind.\n      We have to work hard and get rid of many ills inherited from the past\nand not only to regain but even excel the past glory of a happy and\nprosperous India which had a place of honour in the world. It does not take\nmuch time for weaknesses to creep in but it certainly takes time to remove\nthem. This has been my experience. But I have no doubt that we should try\nto remove the ills as fast as we can. We cannot and should not rest till we\nachieve our cherished ideals. We have to march forward together. It is only\nthen that we can accomplish the task.\n     It is clear that things have improved in many ways. But even then\ncomplaints are loudly voiced that prices have risen, and there is growing\nunrest. But it is my experience that those who complain are the very people\nwho do nothing to improve matters but only worsen matters. On this day I\ndo not want to enter into any controversy about this as it may make our\ntask even more difficult. But one thing is clear : conditions on the price front\nhave not deteriorated. Prices which were going up for 10 years are not\nrising now. It is also clear that the prices of some commodities have even\ncome down. We want the prices to come down further but unless prices of\nall commodities come down, it will not benefit the growers and production\nmight fall. This general reduction should be our aim in every field and we\nare engaging in this task.\n      During the last 10 years our economic growth has been 2 per cent\nbut last year it was 5 per cent. We do not want to boast about this so long\nas the progress does not satisfy everyone. But it is a fact that there has\nbeen progress despite obstacles. For two years, the people were gagged,\ntheir minds were almost closed and it was natural that when they got\nfreedom there should be some unusual activity. There have been strikes in\nsome industries. We have to find solutions for these. But whatever\nsolutions we find, we should keep in view the interest of the entire country,\nand not of any particular section at the cost of others. We have to make\npeople understand this and only this way can we move forward.\n       At some places people indulge in rowdyism and then blame the\ngovernment. It is true that the Government should look after this and we\nare trying to do that. But whatever we do has to be according to the law\nand cannot be autocratic. We have to take the people with us. This is the\npath we are following, and we are getting results - good results. But I can\nwell understand that the people will not be satisfied unless results are\napparent in all spheres. Doubts arise in the public mind on many\noccasions. I consider it the duty of every worker to remove the doubts. We\ncan make the progress that we want only if there is contentment and peace\nin the country and every one feels that he should do nothing which might\nharm the country or his neighbour. We are engaged in this task, the results\nare coming and I am sure that soon we will be able to bring about a\nsituation when all of us will move forward together.\n        But it so happens that our old ills crop up and create problems. It is a\nmatter of shame for all of us that there should be any atrocities on Harijans.\nIt is a disgrace for the country. But it is only by working together that we\ncan eradicate the ignorance and the evil which have entered our society\nover the centuries. I have no doubt about this nor about the fact that we\nhave to take stern action against those who indulge in wrong deeds over\nthis matter. All of you must have heard of the incident outside my residence\nthe day before yesterday. It is a matter of shame for those who indulged in\nsuch action. Unless they understand this they will continue doing these\nwrong things. They had come to see me. They had assured the police that\nthey would be peaceful and would not disturb the peace. In the beginning,\nthey were somewhat peaceful. Five or six of them saw me. They said that\nthe land had been given to the Harijans and other backward poor, was\npasture land, and should be taken back and converted into pasture again.\nThis is what the farmers demanded. These grazing lands were given in\n1970. There is some other land also in the grazing land. I do not agree that\nhis (giving of the land) has created any difficulty for anybody. But the\nfarmers insisted that these lands not be given to those people. A few\nthousand people had gathered from nearby villages a few days ago and\nhad decided to create trouble. This trouble they created the day before.\n       I told them I could not agree to their demands. The land had been\ngiven to Harijans, it would remain with them and nobody could take it back.\nThis has to be understood clearly. They asked why were special privileges\ngiven to Harijans? These privileges should be given to all the poor people\nalike whether they were poor Harijans, Brahmins, Rajputs or others. I told\nthem that the Constitution gave certain privileges to Harijans because they\nhad suffered for centuries and for no fault of theirs had been forced to live\nin a miserable condition. The responsibility was ours, of the entire society.\nIt was necessary to give them some privileges to remove their difficulties\nand to enable them to live on par with others. They said the Constitution\nmust be amended. I said “How can you say this?\" Then they were angry\nand they would have it done. I said \"if this is your decision and you are bent\non creating trouble, you please go. I will not talk to you\". They taken went\nout and incited the people outside and what did they do? All of a sudden,\nthey became unruly. They had some lathis and arms with them when\nforced police starting firing. But we must understand that if the crowd is\nbent upon creating mischief, harms others and listens to no one, then there\nis no way but to open fire. Nobody is happy to resort to firing. But it is for\nthe people to tell such element that so long as they indulge in such wrong\nacts, the people would criticize them and support the Government when it\ndeals with them sternly. I believe such things will go on happening so long\nas the people do not express themselves clearly. Therefore, it is necessary\nto face such a situation and I am confident the people will always support\nus, they are supporting us. But it needs a lot of fearlessness, discipline and\ndedication to the interest of the country.\n      The task we are engaged in now is vital and it is\nnecessary to complete it more speedily. It is therefore that we are\ncontinuously engaged in improving the efficiency of the administration. I\nbelieve, there is no example in the world of the way in which the\nadministration had been distorted. But why should I find fault with the\nAdministration. The fault was of those people who were running the\nadministration. Those at the helm of affairs issued orders and the people\ndid not have the strength and courage not to do wrong things. They should\nhave refused wrong order, and resign from the service. It is not very easy\nto give up jobs. We have not yet reached the stage when it is possible to\ntake up another job after giving up the previous one. This makes people\nanxious.\n       We, however, have to create within ourselves, the force which can\nprevent misuse of the administrative machinery. We want to strengthen the\nadministrative machinery in the manner, that it works fearlessly. In this task\nwe have also to enlist the cooperation of all. This we are doing. We are\nhappy that our efforts are producing some results. But we have to make all\nefforts in the direction so long as this machinery does not become fully\nefficient and the people are not convinced that the administrative\nmachinery is there for the service of the people and not for passing orders.\nI am sure that we will get all cooperation from the people in fulfilling this\ntask.\n      Many disturbances take place in our country. At places Hindus and\nMuslims quarrel among themselves. We have also to ensure that this does\nnot happen at all. We can be proud only if such incidents do not take place\nanywhere at all, and everything in the country goes on in an orderly\nfashion. This is the only country where secularism has flourished for\ncenturies. In difficult times of the British, this concept was perverted and we\nwere forced to adopt wrong practices, which continue to with us even\ntoday. In order to eschew these practices, all of us have to work with\ndedication. These are people in the country who create an atmosphere of\nviolence. I have been meeting the leaders of the opposition regularly to\nfight this violence and to find a way out. I am happy that the leaders in the\nOpposition too, are giving serious thought to the problem. I am happy that\nthey are taking the problem seriously. But they too, at times, find\nthemselves helpless because of compulsions of politics. I can foresee\nsome difficulties it but we have to carry our work forward. The opposition is\nas necessary as the ruling party for the proper running of the democratic\norder. That is why we do not want weak opposition. The opposition should\nbe strong but they must keep in the mind the interest of the nation in view\nand work for it. I agree that this is what their hearts also but it takes time to\ngive up old habits, which are difficult to give up. The measures, I am sure,\nwill succeed and I am grateful to the opposition for the cooperation it is\nextending me.\n      You all know that we have a good image in foreign countries and\namong our immediate neighbours. The prestige of India has gone up in all\ncountries but some people in the Opposition say things are to the contrary.\nThey are not ashamed to say it. I am unable to understand how this\nGovernment, the Janata Government, is selling out country to foreign\nhands. Those who were doing this previously are today saying this. I do not\nknow with what face they do so. The prestige of our country has gone high\nin every land and our relations with all countries are on the basis of\nequality. I can go any country to ask for help, my visits are meant to\nstrengthening fraternal relations and I have not asked for any other thing\nfrom any country I have visited. Why should I ask anybody. I have no doubt\nthe prestige of the country will go up in the time to come and it will become\nstrong, which is possible only if we are able to stand on their own feet. If\nany friendly country comes out to help us we will accept it and should be\ngrateful for it. But there should be any compulsion for us to ask for\nanything. But when we get help, we should be prepared to help other\ncountries. That is why we are working steadily in cooperation with other\ncountries and are giving help to other as a part of our duty. This is the\nreason why our relation have improved with our immediate neighbours like\nBangladesh, Sri Lanka, Burma, Afghanistan and Iran.\n      I am happy and grateful to these countries for the cooperation they\nare giving. I am convinced that our relations with Pakistan would also\nimprove. We are also working in improving our relations with China. They\nalso have shown their willingness for this. We welcome it and are\nconvinced that our relations with that country also would improve.\n      You can also share this conviction and we can move forward with\ngreat confidence. We have to remove whatever uneasiness there may be.\nThis cannot be done without discipline. I have full faith in discipline and in\nthe purity of means. This is what Gandhiji taught us. On this point I will not\nmake any compromise with anybody we will pay whatever price I have to\npay for it. The country can become strong only if it moves forward in a\ndisciplined manner and puts up pure means. This is exactly what the\nJanata Party is doing. Some people say that the Janta Party is becoming\nweak. It is wrong because only those say all this who want to see us weak.\nI have a doubt about that the party will emerge stronger from all this. I invite\nyour cooperation, as also blessings, in this task.

Vista International Publishing House, Delhi, India","text":"Thirty years ago the British left this country on this day India became\nIndependent. Jawaharlalji unfurled our National flag at this very historic\nplace and on this same day Gandhiji fasted to bring peace to Calcutta. Ever\nsince on this historic day for the last 30 years, every year we have been\ngreeting the nation.\n       During these 30 years we saw many ups and downs, passed through\nmany crises and also shared common joys and sorrows. We made some\nprogress, specially in industries. We made gentle headway in the field of\neducation, and we achieved some targets in agriculture as well. But, during\nthese thirty years, we were attacked thrice. We came out successful and\nemerged stronger from these wars retaining our national pride. We made\nprogress, but the fruits of progress did not reach all specially 60 to 70 per\ncent of our population, who could benefit from it only marginally. I do not\nlike to find fault with anyone. We all are to be blamed. But we should learn\nfrom whatever had happened. If we do not ponder over it and continue to\nrepeat the same mistakes the very purpose of our freedom, which was to\nimprove the lot of our countrymen and to invest Indian culture with dignity\nso that we could hold our head high in the world, otherwise our dreams\nwould remain unfulfilled. It was not possible either to full it during the past\nthirty years.\n       But the greatest drawback we have suffered from is that at we have\ndrifted from the path shown by Gandhiji a bid to emulate the West. Today\nwe lack a feeling of pride in our country's strength, and therefore, we have\nmoved away from that path. The situation the country deteriorated to a\ngreat extent during the past six to seven years. Democracy was in danger.\nOur prestige in the world went done. People were of the view that\ndemocracy could not function in this country and that Indians do not have\nfaith in democracy. It has caused immense harm.\n     An atmosphere of terror was prevalent and many excesses were\ncommitted during the past two years. The Emergency that was imposed\nwas uncalled for. There should not be any doubt about it. But some people\ncommit mistakes. It is not so blameworthy to commit a mistake as to justify\nit and continue to maintain it. The public had to suffer much during\nemergency. An atmosphere of terror and despondence prevailed\neverywhere.\n      A new wind of change appeared as soon as the elections were\nannounced. Those who were detained were slowly released. The number\nof those detained ran into thousands and was certainly over a lakh. The\nfeeling of helplessness began to disappear and the atmosphere of fear\nbegan to melt away. I can not say that fear has completely disappeared.\nFear does not disappear suddenly. But it has considerably lessened. With\nthe formation of Janata Party in accordance with the wishes of the people,\na new era was ushered in for the first time. We had been fighting among\nourselves since the fifteenth century which had made us weak. We knew\nonly to split one into two and two into four, but we did not know how to unite\ntwo into one. That is why we were placed in such a predicament.\n      Even after Independence, this state of things continued in the\nnational parties and also other parties. Each of them continued splitting. A\nchange came about for the first time when five parties united into one.\nWhat was more important was that all the constituents discarded their\nprevious ways and accepted the Gandhian way. They decided to take this\ncourse and all of those who had been elected took an oath at Rajgath.\nThus started a new phase. This need was felt by us for some years past.\nThis unity of purpose adds to the responsibilities of all of us, particularly\nthose whom the people have given the reins of power with great\nenthusiasm and hopes. Their duties to the people are greater than all the\nother duties. They have to mould their lives in the service of the country in\nsuch a way as to enable the people to march to progress and to become\nfearless, and to raise the country to such heights as to make it the happiest\nnation in the world within the occurs of the next 10 years. This task has to\nbe performed by all of us. There are many difficulties in the way. What has\nbeen done during the last 6-7 years has been responsible for many trouble\nand several shortcomings.\n      I hope that our people will appreciate that it takes time to start any\nnew work but how can it be started without correcting the past defects. We\nhave undertaken this work, we have to work fast and have to remove those\ndefects within the shortest possible time in order to march forward speedily.\nI hope all will cooperate with us in this task, the people will cooperate and\nthose who have been given the opportunity to administer the country, will\ncontinue to serve the people. Not that, they will simply pass Orders. The\npath is beset with difficulties.\n     We have to see to it particularly that the backward classes, who are\nnot small but very large in numbers, do\nnot remain backward. They should breathe new courage, become fearless\nand free from anxieties, and should attain equality with the rest. I would\nrather wish that they forge ahead of others. We have to create such a\nsituation. Atrocities are being perpetrated on our Harijan brothers even\ntoday, of course, those who used to defame, the opposition parties for the\npast seven months, are engaged in this business even today. I am,\nhowever, not bothered by it. We will work steadily in the hope that those\nwho make such derogatory efforts will have to correct themselves and\nunderstand the situation. If the Harijans are attacked, no one will want to\ndeny it. Such incidents will continue until untouchability is completely wiped\nout. We have not worked as much in this direction during the last 30 years\nas we should have done. We are all responsible for it. We have to wipe out\nthis stigma completely during the next five years. We have been subjected\nto much suffering because half of our people are poor and destitute. We\nhave to pay for our sins. It is not a small sin, but a very big sin that has\nbeen committed in this country all along. Even today, we have not come\nout of it completely, we have to expiate it and have to atone for the past. If\nwe do not do so, we will not gain strength necessary to make our country\nhappy. That is why we have to wipe out the stigma of untouchability\ncompletely during the next five years. Not only that; we have to create an\natmosphere to instil equality in the hearts of all we have to work in a\nmanner that this feeling of equality is maintained.\n      Government officers will have to change their attitude. They should\ndo so, I don't blame them as much as those we gave them orders. It will be\nour endeavour to harness the administrative apparatus completely to the\nservice of the people. It will then really become the government worthy of\nour administration. But the Officers will also have to recognise that they\nhave a duty. Those, who have gone astray should have remembered that\nthey are the servants of the people and are paid to serve them. They must\nperform this service to the best of their capacity. If all of them\ndischarge their duties, repression will be a thing of the past. We can then\ncreate an atmosphere in which such things will not be possible again. That\nis why we have issued directives to all of them that they should serve the\npeople in such a manner. If they fail to do so, they will be punished. Let\nthere be no doubt about it. This is the manner in which we have to march\nforward. Our tasks will be accomplished, only if we are able to inspire\nconfidence in the hearts of our countrymen. That is why we request the\npeople to be vigilant and fearless. Otherwise, laxity can overtake the\nadministrators.\n       Administrators will never dare go wrong, if the people are awake and\nexpress themselves without any fear. We want to create and maintain an\nawareness of this power in the people. Therefore we want to turn our\nattention to our villages, which have been neglected in the past. I do not\nsay that they have been allowed to languish completely, but they have\ncertainly not received the attention that should have been given to them.\nEighty per cent, of our people live in the villages which are plagued with\nunemployment and underemployment. Many people run out to the cities,\nwhere slums come up in increasing numbers. The responsibilities towards\nthem also go on increasing. No one can live decently in these slums. If I\nlive there, I will also become like them. There is no doubt about it. So, we\nhave to improve conditions of these slums. It is more important to avoid\ntheir creation. So we have to develop our villages so that people may not\nrun upto the\ncities. On the other hand we would like the urban dweller to go back to\nvillages to improve chances of better health and happiness. We have to\naccomplish a tremendous job. The job is difficult but it is worth doing. We\ncan do it only when we strive hard for it. There is no cause for\nhopelessness. Hopelessness kills a man. It finishes him. The atmosphere\nof fear create helplessness. We have to get out of this atmosphere.\nTherefore government has to instil courage in the people, so that they may\nbecome fearless, I think this is the most urgent task before the government.\nSo long as this is not achieved, we cannot really be effective. I realize we\nmay not be able to achieve it full. There are so many difficulties.\n       Janata Party has come into existence. It is a new party. If certain old\nthings linger in it, it does not mean that the strength of the Janata Party has\nbeen impaired. The party will emerge stronger. It will continuously derive\nsustenance and strength from the people. I am confident that nobody will\nbe able to break the party. We want people's help in this task. I request you\nnot to be misled by anyone. If you have any doubt or misgiving, you may\nask me. I will certainly explain things to you. I can assure you that wherever\nany corrective action, is needed, I and my colleagues will take that action.\nTherefore, you should be vigilant, fearless and stand by the right things.\nYou have the right to point out to us our mistakes. We will listen to you. We\nwill also tell you the correct position. Wherever mistakes are detected we\nwill remove thern. It is our duty to rectify mistakes and we want people's\nassistance in this task. My dream that the whole of India should be like a\nfamily is bound to come true. We are marching towards this goal with\nconfidence. Our country will really become one when we are transformed\ninto one family. Only then will India be able to cooperate with the whole\nworld and help it. We have to become competent to serve the world. We\nhave to serve others rather than be served by them. If we accept, such\nservice, it is only to enable us serve the world better. Only then, Gandhiji's\ndream will come true. Gandhiji wanted Ram-Rajya in this country. Ram\nRajya means that those. Who run the Government should bear the\ndifficulties themselves but not allow the people to suffer.\n      They should set an example to the people of their own lives of\nsimplicity. We should not forget that we have to serve the people all the\ntime. We should be people's servants and the people should keep us as\nsuch. We want to create this power in the people. That is why I have been\nrepeatedly requesting the people to let us know our shortcomings. They\nshould point out our drawbacks without any hesitation.\n       Once I had said that if I am on the wrong path you can pull up my\nears, and also those of my colleagues. We colleagues are all one. We are\nnot separate. All are combined to make us one. There is nobody, who is\nhigh or low among us. But one should not forget that the people are even\nbigger. This is what we have to prepare our people to realise. This is our\nmain duty, I have no doubt about this; But all these things cannot be\ncompleted till unemployment is removed. We have to provide full\nemployment in our villages. Nobody should be unemployed or\nunderemployed. Only then production will increase and the cost of\nproduction will go down which is very essential. If prices fall, the country's\nprestige will go up. It is very essential to bring down prices. Some people\nhave been disappointed that even now this has not been accomplished.\nBut I would plead with you to remember that such messy conditions were\nbequeathed to us that to bring about immediate result was impossible. But\nwe have taken certain steps and there have been some results. I know\ntheir impact has not yet reached the people. But I am sure that very soon,\nsuch an impact will be created and people will realise this. We have to\nincrease production which can be done by the people and government\ntogether. We have to go ahead with full confidence, with cooperation and\nwith affection for each other. This is the lesson that every Indian has to\nadopt in his life. Only then we will be able to make the country as great as\nGandhiji wanted it to be. We will then have Ram Raj, which will be free\nfrom strife or sorrow, and where people will help each other. The basis of\nour culture is that man should not think about himself alone. He should be\nable to have consideration for others and share their joys and sorrows. This\nfoundation of our culture has weakened. We have to reinforce it with this\nquality. I have every hope that people will cooperate in this. Therefore we\nmust move ahead with hope and faith. We should discard despondency.\nWe should take this pledge today. I have no doubt about our capacity to\nmarch ahead. Nobody has been able to destroy India. Many civilizations\nhave disappeared from the surface of this earth. But our country has\nsurvived. Poet Iqbal had said “Kuch bat hai hasti mit ti nahin hamari” (That\nthere is something which keeps us going). This is the beauty and\ncharacteristic of our culture. We should never lose heart. Let us pledge\ntoday to march forward. Then nobody will be able to stop us and we will be\nable to serve the entire world.\nJai Hind!"},{"year":1976,"pm":"Indira Gandhi","party":"INC","title":"With Discipline, a Better Life","footnote":"Free rendering of the speech delivered in Hindi from the ramparts of the Red Fort, New Delhi, on August 15, 1976","source":"Selected Speeches of Indira Gandhi: September 1972-March 1977","text":"Whenever I hoist the National Flag here, I am reminded of the historic\noccasion when Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru had first unfurled the flag here. We\nare reminded of the suffering and hardships through which we had to pass\nand the hopes with which we had put up our flag. When we look back, we\nfind that we have advanced a good deal along the path we had chosen for\nourselves. We also find that we have committed mistakes. We have had\nour shortcomings. And the farther we have come, the longer the road has\nseemed to be. At every turn we have found that the difficulties have only\nincreased instead of decreasing and that if we have been able to meet\nsome demands, there are many more to take their place. But life is like that\nand our effort has been to follow in the footsteps of the great leaders of the\npast.\n       Freedom is of various kinds. We deliberately chose the goal of Purna\nSwaraj (complete independence) as any other freedom would not have\nbeen real. Purna Swaraj does not merely mean the freedom to choose our\nrepresentatives, the freedom for newspapers to make as much noise as\nthey want, although they may be representing the views of a small minority.\nWhat it means is that the fruits of freedom should reach every home,\nspecially the homes of those who cannot raise their voice and who do not\nknow what they want. We are trying to take our country towards this kind of\nfreedom. But, there are all kinds of difficulties on the way. It is also bound\nto hurt some section of the people or the other. We want to improve the\nstandard of living of all people, big or small. But, I am sure you will realise\nthat if the “haves” get even more, not much will be left for the “have-nots”.\nThat's why our socio-economic programmes, though meant for all, have\nspecially the interests of the weaker sections as their objective, whatever\nthe reason for their condition- caste, economic or the regional situation.\n     Thus, at every step, we have to confront some problem or the other.\nBut we have not faltered in our steps and I am glad to report that the\ncountry has taken a big stride forward during the past year.\n      There was one particular programme which called for action both on\nthe part of the Government and the people. The programme was based on\nour feeling that there was a new wave of discipline and awakening in the\ncountry. I don't claim that all our hopes were fulfilled. Still, we have taken\nsome concrete steps forward and the programme is still underway. It has\nmade marked progress in those parts of the country where the people were\nmore responsive. You must be aware that production has increased by\nseven percent. Similarly, we have provided houses to seven million families\nunder our housing programme. Power production too has gone up to 2000\nmegawatts. The expansion of irrigation facilities too is going on apace.\nLand reforms have not been as fast as we wanted. This is not a new\nscheme, but new problems crop up every time in land distribution.\n      In far off places, they escape our eyes with the result that sometimes\nmistakes are committed. That is why I keep on saying, time and again, that\npeople themselves should bring to our notice cases of injustice. This should\nbe not merely by way of complaint but also to suggest to us how the\nproblem is to be tackled. We have received greater co-operation from the\npeople during the past year. This is not to suggest that nothing had been\ndone in the previous years. If we had not laid a sound industrial and\nagricultural base, we could not have progressed as we did last year. At the\nsame time, it is also true that nothing could have been achieved without\ndiscipline, howsoever strong the foundation. You would recall that\nindiscipline was rampant in schools, colleges, factories and elsewhere. It\nnot merely affected production leading to greater shortage of the\nnecessities of life, but all around one only heard slogans of strike and\nrevolution.\n      We too believe in revolution. I believe that Gandhiji was the biggest\nrevolutionary. But his was the path of non-violence, of peace, of friendship\nand if we had strayed from that path, we would not have been able to\nachieve Independence and lay the foundation of our democracy. We tried\nto step up industrialisation and add to the country's strength in every\npossible way. Howsoever people may try to denigrate our country, there is\nno one who can deny that India was never as strong as she is today.\nWithout strength, we cannot improve the condition of the masses. We\nimagined that once we had won the struggle for freedom, our\nIndependence would be secure. But, we had to contend with foreign\naggressions. More dangerous than these are, however, the secret\ncampaigns which are not visible on the surface. We could hear whispers\nhere and there even earlier. But last year, they turned into an open\nchallenge. These countries which did not help India preferred to support\ndictatorial regimes, which liquidated hundreds, even thousands of people.\nNot one of these countries talked about these killings. But, they had the\ntemerity to criticise us.\n       You may perhaps, recall that this is not the first time it has happened.\nWhen Gandhiji was alive, he was also roundly criticised. So was Nehru.\nAnd before these sections had turned their attention to me, they had\nswitched over to India as the target of their attacks. Why should India\nconduct an atomic explosion, they asked, as if this was going to pose a big\ndanger to the world. On the other hand, many of these countries were\nspending billions on their nuclear arsenal without any excuse of an external\ndanger. They can keep on arming themselves, but we don't have the right\nto do anything even for our economic development. When we started\nsetting up our steel plants, we were asked why should we need them when\nour villages were still so poor. You know that steel is the basis of industrial\ndevelopment. It is needed by farmers, factories and the people. If\nJawaharlal Nehru had not planned for steel production, we would have\nbeen begging abroad for it. Today, we don't have to beg for anything,\nalthough we still need a lot of things.\n       Only a few years back, the prophets of doom said that India would\nnever be able to feed its millions. Today, we have had a harvest of 120\nmillion tons of foodgrains and we don't know where to store them. It is true\nthat Nature had been kind. But we would not have reached this level of\nproduction without the help offered by the Government to which the farmers\nreadily responded. Some areas, specially in the south, have suffered from\ndrought and in a few other places, rainfall has been too heavy. I\nsympathise with the farmers who have suffered as a result. I know they will\nbe able to face the situation courageously with the help of scientific\nadvancement. We have to see that our Plan schemes reach the remotest\ncorners. We would also like to have special programmes for the various\nregions, which should take into account their specific needs. We will be\nable to march forward briskly only when we are imbued with the desire to\nmake the fullest use of our resources and not by demanding the setting up\nof steel plants or big industrial factories.\n      We have seen this year that some of our public sector undertakings\nhave registered a profit, although the big industrialists were never tired of\nsaying that the Government was not capable of running factories. Whatever\nincrease in production we have had is because of these factories and I am\nconfident that those which have been lagging behind will also catch up. So,\nwe have to be vigilant all the time to maintain the improvement. I would like\nto congratulate our workers who have contributed to it.\n       I will be leaving in a short while for Sri Lanka where, you know, there\nis big conference of the non-aligned nations. The problems there too is how\nto safeguard freedom- freedom to think, act and work for each country's\nfuture. This is the main problem. If we cooperate and assist each other, we\ncan create a new strength. Poet Tagore has said that if the weak act boldly\nand firmly, they can generate their own power. This has been our\nexperience also. What was our strength during the freedom movement?\nWe were poor and oppressed. And yet, when we came together and stuck\ntogether, we created a force which was even mightier than any army.\n       This is the strength we have to inculcate among the poor. The\nproblem is that there are some countries which are misled by others. They\nare keen to seek assistance if they can get it. They don't care if this is going\nto affect their freedom, for it cannot bring the strength. We have also\naccepted assistance from other countries, irrespective of their ideologies.\nBut we were firm on one point. We were prepared to accept it only on the\ncondition that our freedom of action for our country's betterment will not be\neroded. But we are not prepared to seek aid on any terms. We have stuck\nto this policy right from the beginning. Today, we are criticised, because of\nsome restrictions on newspapers and some arrests. The real reason is that\nour critics cannot tolerate the idea of a poor country like ours marching\nahead without the assistance of others. My reply to them is only this: the\nmore they condemn us, the greater will be our resolve to stick to our own\npath of progress.\n       You have seen in the past how we have stood up to foreign\naggressions. The history of this country has been full of such struggles. We\nhave always stood for peace and tolerance, but we should remember that\nours is also a history of courage, bravery and idealism. You are all the\nrepresentatives of a resurgent India, the symbols of a new awakening. This\nis important for all, young or old. Criticism or praise is a small matter in\none's life. There is only one question before us: How can we take our\ncountry forward? This should be our aim, whether others like it or not. If the\nyounger generation is not imbued with the ideal of service to the nation, it\nwill prove to be our greatest weakness.\n      We have to guard our frontiers and take pride in our armed forces.\nBut they can fight bravely if the nation is behind them. Let us take a look\ntoday at our past and future and then decide the direction in which we have\nto move towards progress. This is our own responsibility which we have to\ndischarge with the strength of our hands and the intellect of our minds.\nAnd, if we have this resolve, no one can push us back. I am confident that\nwe will be able to add more to the discipline we have acquired.\n      There is some speculation these days about the lifting of the\nemergency that had been declared. No one bothers to notice that it has\nalready been relaxed for several months. What's the result of this\nrelaxation? Has any one of those released admitted that violence, strikes or\nstoppage of work is bad for the country? Is it not that they are still bent on\nthe same path? What happens in future is not in our hands. It depends on\nthe attitude of those who are engaged in fomenting unrest and indiscipline\nand in acts of violence and sabotage. They are encouraging forces which\nhave no faith in democracy and secularism or in the kind of freedom that\nwe stand for.\n       We are again on the march and we have to see that the schemes\nlaunched to remove poverty after so many years keep up the tempo that\nhas been acquired. Maybe, the pace is not as fast as we would like it to be.\nSeven million houses in a big country like ours is not a substantial figure.\nBut it is still some achievement, looking at the fact that there was none\nearlier.\n      We want people to take part in schemes for their betterment of their\nown volition, with a will to serve the country. Gandhiji always stressed that\nthere was no right which did not flow out of a responsibility. Only on the\nbasis of such rights can we achieve true democracy in which the poorest of\nthe poor will also be able to make himself heard in which no section will be\nable to dominate others because of its social or economic privileges and\nwhere the people will try to safeguard not merely their own rights but also\nthose of their under-privileged brothers and sisters. If we care only for the\nrights of a few, we will only be relapsing into a situation which has proved\nharmful in the past.\n      Today, in this country, we need courage and vision to fashion a new\nIndia. This will need united efforts on the part of all to lift our country to a\nposition of glory. We have to improve the living conditions of the masses\nand to see that the future of our children is better and bright. My prayer is\nthat we all should march shoulder to shoulder on this great journey.\n     Before I close, let me congratulate you all once again on this\nauspicious occasion and wish you a happy future.\n      Jai Hind! Jai Hind! Jai Hind!"},{"year":1975,"pm":"Indira Gandhi","party":"INC","title":"Eradication of Poverty","footnote":"Free rendering of an address in Hindi from the Red Fort, Delhi, August 15, 1975","source":"Selected Speeches of Indira Gandhi: September 1972-March 1977","text":"This year there is one thing new; not only the people assembled here\nare able to see me but people in 2,400 villages spread over in six States in\nthe country are able to participate along with us in today's historic function.\nThey also are able to witness this historic occasion and hear whatever is\nhappening. Something new has happened not only in the history of India\nbut, perhaps, also in the history of the entire world when rural programmes\nhave been started through the satellite at a time when TV has not covered\nfully even the cities. For this achievement we are grateful to our young and\nbright scientists, whose work and labour have enabled India to take a big\nstride towards progress. Similarly, during this year our scientists performed\nanother great feat when they put a satellite in space. You all have heard\nabout the satellite, Aryabhata. All this is symbolic of the nation's progress.\n       We have unfurled the flag here today and we do so every year\nbecause it represents our urge cherished since pre-Independence days, to\nunfurl free India's flag on the ramparts of the Red Fort. An opposition leader\nonce remarked : what is this flag, but a mere piece of cloth! Surely, this is a\npiece of cloth but one for which thousands of freedom fighters had\nsacrificed their lives. For this same piece of cloth our brave soldiers painted\nthe Himalayan snow. with their blood. This piece of cloth is symbolic of the\nunity and strength of India. It is because of this that we revere this piece of\ncloth and always keep it aloft. We are never to let it dip low and every\nIndian, high or low, man or woman, young or old or child, has to remember\nthis always. This is a piece of cloth all right, but it is dearer to us than our\nlives.\n      Like the calumny about the national flag, misunderstanding was also\ncreated recently about our Independence. Freedom is not a magic which\ncan independently eradicate poverty and remove our difficulties.\nIndependence only opens a door, which removes the stagnation of\ncenturies. That is all that Independence means. It does not mean the\nlicence to do whatever we may want to do. Rather it offers us an\nopportunity to do our duty.\n      Independence does not merely mean a Government by Indians. It\nmeans that the Government should be capable of taking independent\ndecisions courageously. It must also mean that such a Government should\nbe capable of thinking independently in the interest of the country as well\nas in the interest of world peace. All this together would mean\nIndependence.\n       We became free not to destroy whatever we had or violate our\ncherished ideals, but because we had to lift the people, who had remained\noppressed for centuries and also because we had to fight and vanquish the\nevils that had crept in due to feudalism, casteism and superstitions, and\nwhich were responsible for our backwardness. We must do away with them\nand uplift the country to progress. It was for this that our great leaders\nguided us and opened the door of Independence.\n       Since we became free, much has happened in the country and we\nhave made a lot of progress. I have referred to the Aryabhata and also to\nthe other communication satellite, but apart from that we have made great\nprogress in every direction, including agriculture, industry, education and\nhealth. It is true that the benefits of this progress have not reached the\npoor, nor could that happen immediately. We have first to lay strong\nfoundations for the country and all these years we have been busy laying\nthose foundations. All of you know the difficulties that we encountered and\nall of you, who are assembled here and the millions who are listening to my\nvoice as well as those who are able to see me in the distant States, have\ngone through difficult times and faced difficulties courageously. And,\nbecause you had courage, hope and faith, you were able to surmount\nthose difficulties.\n      The path we chose ourselves was the path of democracy. But, what\ndoes democracy mean? Like freedom, democracy too does not mean that\neverybody is free to follow his individual path. People can opt for\nthemselves policies, they can follow a different line of thinking, they can\nraise their voice of protest, but all this has to be done within a certain set of\nrules. They cannot adopt a course that would cause pain to others or\nweaken the country or allow alien influences to condition our policies and\ntamper with our course. I have just now said that we take our decisions\nindependently. For some years, and particularly at the present juncture,\nfalse propaganda and rumours are being indulged in, but I wish to reiterate\nthat our policies are not the policies of one or the other power bloc.\n       We do not belong to this or that bloc, nor do we belong to any third\nbloc. We go ahead keeping in view only the interest of India. I want to make\nit clear that we have never allowed any other country to interfere in our\naffairs. We are not letting it happen now and we will not let it happen ever.\nThis does not mean that we do not want friendship with other countries. We\nwant friendship with all, particularly with our neighbours, with whom it is\nnecessary to have friendship and co-operation. Our endeavour is to\ndevelop friendship and co-operation even with those countries who are not\nour neighbours, because in the world of today we have to move together\nand help each other. Because we are not moving together and because\nquite often we let tensions arise, the world is not able to progress the way it\nought to, and science and new discoveries are not able to benefit millions\nand millions of people who must benefit from them. Amid all tensions,\ndisputes and misunderstandings, our policy has always been to remove\nmisunderstandings, and wherever there are disputes, try to settle them\nthrough discussions and conciliation, rather than war.\n      Within the country also we have followed the same policy.\nUnfortunately, some people thought that they had to adopt a different\ncourse. This different course did not represent any particular policy\nbecause people subscribing to different points of view had joined hands\ntogether. These people did not see eye to eye with each other either\nregarding the country's foreign policy, or its policy at home, and yet they\njoined together. It cannot be claimed, therefore, that the agitation was\nstarted on the basis of some policy.\n      We saw that very many evils which existed earlier spread further.\nThey increased instead of decreasing. Why did that happen? Why did\nindiscipline spread? The students were exhorted to stay away from schools\nand colleges, the workers were asked to stop work in the factories. Thus,\nwhether one was in administration or in any other profession indiscipline\ninfiltrated everywhere. Everyone thought of taking advantage of the\nopportunity and serving his own selfish interests. Everyone forgot about the\ncountry and did not keep in mind the direction we had to follow, the\nprogrammes we had to implement, the long journey we had to make the\ndifficulties confronting us, and the dangers we faced.\n       Despite the progress that we had otherwise made, the last year, as\nyou all know, was a year of economic difficulties. There was inflation,\nincreased unemployment and scarcity of essential commodities. This\nsituation prevailed not only in our country, but in the entire world. We did\nnot lose heart and we boldly faced the situation. We took strong measures\nagainst black-marketing, hoarding, smuggling and corruption, and these\nmeasures started to have their impact on rising prices.\n       But these measures did not make our opponents happy. On the\ncontrary, it somehow infuriated them further. They decided, therefore, to\nlaunch all over the country the Gujarat and Bihar type movements, aimed\nparticularly against the Central Government. The opposition consisted of\nmany parties, including the factions, who did not believe either in\ndemocracy or in non-violence. You can very well visualise what would have\nhappened to the country had such an agitation been allowed to be\nlaunched. Would it not have added to the misery of the people? Would it\nnot have weakened the country? Such would have been the consequences\nat any time, more so, at a time when in a changing world we are faced with\nall kinds of dangers and the people are greatly concerned with their survival\nand progress. You can very well imagine the impact of launching of such\nan agitation at such a time would have had on our children and on\neverybody else.\n      We, therefore, had to take certain stringent measures after careful\nthought. We took these measures with a heavy heart but we were helpless.\nIn a way, it created an unusual situation, but in a sense these measures\nwere taken to arrest the unusual situation that had continued for some\nyears. You have seen the impact these measures have had. The prices\nstarted falling, and we witnessed a new wave of discipline. The students\nwho were not prepared to sit for their examinations took them voluntarily.\nThe people in every walk of life also applied themselves to their tasks.\n      Some prices did increase recently but this price increase is a\ncommon phenomenon during the monsoon. There have been natural\ncalamities also. In Bihar, U.P., Punjab, Assam and at some other places\nthere were serious floods. I have deep sympathies with the flood-affected\npeople, and we are making all efforts to provide relief to them as soon as\npossible.\n       But, with all this we can claim that the rate of price rise, which had not\nbeen controlled even last year, has been totally arrested this year. The rate\nof increase in unemployment also had been halted last year but\nunemployment exists and it can be removed only when we accept\ndiscipline and increase production. It will be removed when all students or\nteachers, traders or consumers, writers or artists or those belonging to\nthousands of other professions--would stop thinking only of themselves.\nOnly when they become an instrument of change in their profession and\ncommunity, the country will truly be able to progress fast.\n      It is our earnest endeavour to look after those members of the\nopposition who do not happen to be outside. I have written to the Chief\nMinisters to instruct their officers to ensure that no injustice or excess is\ndone. All law-abiding citizens must always be helped. Whether it is the\npolice or other officials, they must act as friends of the people. If any\nperson sincerely realises that he has committed a genuine mistake, he\nshould be helped to be reformed.\n      The present occasion is similar to the one when with great hopes free\nIndia's flag was first unfurled, as you might recall, not here but at the India\nGate in New Delhi. We had felt that a new opportunity had come our way.\nSoon after we were engaged in solving a number of problems; evils like\nindolence, corruption, inefficiency creeped in. Since we were busy tackling\nmore important issues, these evils got a chance to grow. Today, we have\nan opportunity to eradicate them, set right our national policies and work\nunitedly as one man to build a new India. Every nation is faced with some\nproblems. Whatever the problems, India has always tried to solve them\nduring peace and war, with patience and courage.\n       I see a large number of our brave soldiers, of Army, Air Force, Navy\nand police in front of me. People at times tend to refer to the police in\ninimical terms. But they too are sons, brothers and fathers, as they also are\nfrom among the people. If sometimes they err, they should be directed to\nthe right path and create an atmosphere of friendship and cooperation.\n      We have always been proud of our brave soldiers, and we always will\nbe proud of them. They brave the seasons and guard our frontiers with\ndetermination. They know that it has never been our policy to attack any\ncountry; our policy has always been that of friendship. We have always to\nbe vigilant but we will not launch an offensive, except against aggression.\n      Today, a new opportunity has presented itself to us to move forward,\nparticularly on the economic front. With the co-operation and help of the\npeople, the pace of progress can be accelerated. I have been receiving\noffers of co-operation from groups of people, including students, and I am\nglad that they are now concentrating upon their studies. Many of them are\nsimultaneously devoting themselves to social service. The workers are\nengaged in increasing production. The farmers, as always, are engaged in\nhard work. I am glad that the rains have been good this year and their\nlabour will certainly yield a good harvest.\n       All of us have a duty to perform. We have the duty to work for the\nadvancement of our community and bring about in it a new awareness. We\nalso have to consider what each one of us can do, not only in of his or her\nown field, but also in respect of tasks concerning the community. Take, for\nexample, the question of cleanliness of your house, its vicinity and the\nroads. It is not the duty of the Government or a Municipality or of certain\nofficials alone to ensure cleanliness. It is the duty of the entire public, of\neach and every citizen. Similarly, there other things to take care of. There\nshould be no wastage; we may buy only what is absolutely necessary; we\nshould not hoard. If the prices go up, housewives should try to find out why\nit was happening and whether they could check it. Whenever there has\nbeen a collective efforts, they have always succeeded. We have also to\nsave our forests by planting more trees. The people have also to ensure\nthe success of the family planning programme. There are many other\nactivities, which may be called governmental activities that affect each one\nof us, as also the future of the country. All of us should work together to\nmake these programmes a success. We have to show a new way to our\nchildren.\n      We were not happy to declare emergency, but we had to under the\ncompulsion of circumstances. But, every dark cloud has a silver lining.\nStringent measures were taken just as bitter pills have to be administered\nto a patient in the interest of his health. We should use the opportunity to\ncleanse the political, economic and other aspects of the national life, and\nbring some charm and freshness to it. We have learnt a lot from science,\nbut we have to learn much more. We are no better or worse than other\ncountries. Every country has its good points and bad points and so have\nwe.\n      But, India has also its tradition of honouring sacrifice and service. Its\nspecial characteristic has been to develop spiritual strength. While we may\nlearn many things from other countries and not close our minds to new\nideas, we cannot ignore the roots we have in our culture. Our culture\nstands for a synthesis of the spiritual and scientific values to evolve a new\nman. This is the demand of times and the need of the society.\n       Many years ago, Jawaharlal Nehru had said: \"Freedom is in peril,\ndefend it with all your might.\" I would reiterate Freedom is not endangered\nby our not allowing some people to speak out. It is not a good thing to\nimpose this restriction and it has to go. I have emphasised this on two\nearlier occasions. But freedom is imperilled when we forget to understand\nthe true meaning of freedom and of democracy and when we don't realise\nwhere the interests of the nation lie. If we have to save our freedom we\nhave to bring about once again the unity, determination and courage which\nwill enable all to work unitedly and increase production.\n       It is the endeavour of the Government to remove obstructions that\nhamper progress. At the same time, we have to consider how these\nhurdles were created. The obstacles came because some people were\nbent on exploiting the situation to their advantage. Had those people not\ntaken undue advantage, there would have been no need to curb their\nactivities. All of us have to ponder over these problems. Real freedom will\ncome when we remove poverty from the country. Real democracy will\ncome when socialism and secularism are fully established. Some people,\nwho in the recent past kept raising slogans of democracy, did not believe in\nsocialism and were in fact indulging in communalism.\n       Now is the time for us to think afresh over all these problems. We\nhave also to understand the functioning of the Government. Some people\naccuse me of concentrating all power in my hands. But the orders that I\nmay give have to pass down to Ministers and then on to big and small\nofficers at various levels and finally to the patwaris in the villages. In the\nprocess, the orders are sometimes implemented and sometimes not. At\ntimes, some people inadvertently modify these orders. At other times, they\nget altered deliberately. Some people exploit the orders to their advantage,\nwhile some others are always busy preventing their implementation. All\nthese things happen, and this is the one main reason why we could not\nimplement some of our major policies.\n       I meet not thousands but millions of people. There would hardly be\nany person in the world, who would meet such a large number of people\ncoming to me almost every day from all corners of the country. I receive\nmany reports every day, but the country is so vast that it is not possible to\nget all the information. Some information comes late and some does not\ncome at all. Therefore, all of you, wherever you might be, have to bear in\nmind that it is our duty to defend democracy, I have to see that the\nprogramme of eradication of poverty moves vigorously ahead, despite\nattempts by powerful elements to obstruct it. I have to ensure that the\nstreets, the villages and the cities remain clean and beautiful. I have also\nannounced the 20-Point Economic Programme. There are many big and\nsmall tasks to complete. Until and unless everyone of us does not accept\nhis or her responsibility with regard to these tasks, the danger of mutilation\nof these programmes will always remain.\n       There is a new thinking today and the people should ponder over it\ndeeply. They should not be swayed by slogan-mongering. They should not\nvacillate and be misled. Instead, they should move resolutely and keep\ntheir objective in view. When that is done, as I have emphasised many a\ntime, no one would be able to stop India from marching ahead. No one,\nwithin or without, who is opposed to India becoming strong, can prevent it\nfrom marching ahead. We have, therefore, assembled here today to take\nthe pledge to work hard, to make sacrifices and to serve the nation, in order\nto achieve real freedom and democracy. This pledge has to be taken by all,\nboth young and old, in order to build the nation that may draw from our\ntradition and also benefit from the modern knowledge.\n        We are gradually developing our resources, but our greatest assets\nare our courage, morale and self-confidence. Only when these remain\nunwavering, will we be able to build India of our dreams. Only then will we\nbe able to serve the poor, provide adequate employment to the people of\nall religions and classes, and keep our pledges to provide them with their\nrequirements. I ask you all to have confidence in yourself and in the future\nof the country. Ours is not an easy path; it is full of difficulties, bristling with\nthorns. It is not a path of rest and respite, but of hard work. But, if you move\non this path you will be able to find a new world, you will achieve a new\ncontentment, because you will realise that you are building a new India and\ncreating history."},{"year":1974,"pm":"Indira Gandhi","party":"INC","title":"Towards the Bright Future","footnote":"Free rendering of an address in Hindi from the Red Fort, Delhi, August 15, 1974","source":"Selected Speeches of Indira Gandhi: September 1972-March 1977","text":"In our long history, the people of India have passed through many\nvicissitudes and undergone many sufferings, but today the economic\nproblems influence us all. Thus, while I am happy on our Independence\nDay anniversary, my heart is also full of sorrow and anxiety. I am aware of\nthe difficulties you are facing. Floods and droughts have further added to\nthe sufferings of the people already burdened with economic difficulties. My\nsympathies go out to you all.\n       The most important question today is that of rising prices and scarcity\nof essential commodities. You are also aware of the circumstances which\nhave brought about this situation. But, this should not lead us to believe\nthat nothing has been achieved during all these years. In one sense, it is\nthe progress that we have made and the crises and challenges that we\nhave faced, which have contributed to our economic difficulties. At a time\nlike this, we should not be debating as to how and why these difficulties\nhave arisen. Instead, we should be thinking of the ways to surmount these\nproblems unitedly. In the past also, the Indian people tackled many a crisis\non a war footing and overcame them successfully.\n       Drought and war have led to shortages of many commodities. There\nhas been good progress in our agricultural production, and you are aware\nthat it has even doubled or tripled. However, in the last four years the rate\nof growth has not been the same as it was in the previous years. This year,\nparticularly, shortage of fertilisers and quality seeds further added to the\ndifficulties. Even so, the shortages are not unbearable. We may have to\nmodify our habits, change traditional ways and may also have to suffer a\nbit. Once we accept this, it would not be beyond us to put up with the\nsituation. The most dangerous thing would be to give up hope and to feel\nthat nothing has been done or can be done.\n      At a time like this, everyone has some responsibility or the other. Of\ncourse, the first responsibility lies with the Government and we are not\noverlooking this factor. You must have observed that for some time past,\nwe have taken stringent steps to reduce Government expenditure. Many\nprogrammes, although beneficial to the people, but not considered\nessential, have been abandoned. Many things are in short supply and the\nGovernment is devoting its attention to reducing their consumption in order\nto conserve them for essential purposes. It was never our intention to\nfreeze or reduce wages or dearness allowance. All that we want is that a\npart of it may be set aside and not be spent. The money, so deposited, will\nalso fetch attractive interest. When there is greater spending, the money\nsupply increases and if production is not proportionately increased it leads\nto serious consequences.\n      You are all aware of the unavoidable and essential expenditure the\nGovernment had to incur on giving relief to the drought-stricken people and\non war. On the other hand, there were some other unavoidable items of\nexpenditure which led to further inflation. We are at present engaged in\ncontaining inflation, and to some extent we have succeeded. If you would\nunderstand the issues involved and extend us your co-operation, we would\nbe able to succeed in greater measure and save the situation.\n       Our farmers have been giving considerable help. There is often a\ndiscussion whether priority should be given to the agriculture or industry.\nNow, there is no question of differentiating between the two. We have to\nsee that both prosper simultaneously. Our farmers feed the country, and it\nis only through their toil that this country has survived through the\ncenturies. Therefore, it is natural that they should be given all help so that\nproduction increases and the standard of living of villagers goes up. It is\ntheir duty to utilise every inch of land for agriculture and it is the duty of us\nall not to do anything to spoil the fertility of the land.\n      The demand for chemical fertilisers has gone up, and now there is a\nshortage of fertilisers. The shortage is not only because production has\nlessened but because the demand has gone up. Today, even the small\nfarmer wants to use chemical fertilisers, and we are indeed happy that he is\nprepared to adopt modern technology. But, at the same time, we have to\nsee whether we can utilise alternative sources. Now, even some of the\naffluent countries of the world are taking to old methods. This is all due to\nshortages. It is also because they have realised that satisfactory results\ncan be obtained only through a combination of the old and the new. When\nthe use of chemical fertilisers came into vogue, the farmer saw that\nproduction increased through its use and he started using it in increasing\nquantities. He gave up the use of manures, which he used earlier, for\ninstance, cowdung, green manure and waste. Now, to overcome shortages\nand also to see that the fertility of the land remains at a high level, it is\nnecessary to use both types of fertilisers side by side.\n       Similar is the case with shortage of other resources, like power. The\nGovernment is trying to increase generation of power through every\nmeans. There is shortage of oil and we have undertaken oil exploration.\nBut, still we have to discover alternative sources of energy, which can be\nharnessed. Here, again, if we look at the West, we find that many of the old\nmethods are once again coming into vogue. This may not be a permanent\nphenomenon, but it is essential now because we have to tide over the\ndifficult situation. We have also to see how we can harness solar energy\nand wind power. Today, the discovery should not be confined only to the\nscientist. Every individual, whether in the village or in the city, has to see\nwhat new methods he can discover and put to use for the benefit of society.\nOn the one hand, the farmer has to see that agricultural production goes\nup; on the other, our industries also have to be developed. If there are no\nindustries, many of our essential commodities cannot be made available\nand even the farmer will not get his basic necessities. Whatever the farmer\nneeds- quality seeds, tractors or other implements- they are all\nmanufactured in big factories, the establishment of which has cost us\ncrores of rupees. The rich farmers, who have benefited mainly from the\nnew technology, should help to raise the standard of living of the villagers.\nGreater the awareness in the villages, more the agricultural production and\ngreater the availability of things of comfort and entertainment.\n      Today, when we increase taxes, who bears the burden?\nUnfortunately, the big people avoid taxes through some means or the\nother. Many of their names do not even figure in the income-tax list. All\nbusinessmen are not bad, but through the misdeeds of some of them, the\nentire community gets a bad name. Those who do not pay taxes or sell\nadulterated food or medicines or those who hoard and earn black-money\nare responsible for the misery of our country. This is a blot on India's name.\nSome people exploit the people's difficulties for their selfish ends without\nany thought for the future. It is not only a question of the future of others. It\nis also a question of the future of their own children. So, when so many big\npeople and some of the people of middle classes like contractors, doctors,\nlawyers and the self-employed do not pay taxes, what happens? The entire\nburden of taxes falls on those people who are in the fixed income group.\n       Sometimes, we are accused of imposing a land but are overlooking\nthe city-dwellers. There are so many rich people in the cities. Are we\noverlooking them? Some measures have been taken. Taxes have been\nraised and we are trying to see in what ways we can limit wealth. Unless\nthe people share each other's burden, the country will never be able to\nimprove.\n       Just as the country is dependent on the performance of the farmers, it\nis also dependent on the production capacity and discipline of the labour\nand the management of the industries. Only through hard work can we\nincrease the production and only by overcoming the mutual differences can\nwe help our farmers and the entire country. Today, all classes are facing\ndifficulties. In fact, the whole world has always faced one difficulty or the\nother. We all have to get together and overcome these. I am aware of the\nfact that in times of great hardships, it is the poor who have to bear greater\nburden because the rich have greater capacity for absorption and\nsustenance. Similar is the case with the affluent nations. India may be a\npoor country and thus the burden may have told upon her, but we also\nknow that Indians have not given up hope in any adverse circumstances.\nOn the contrary, the people have emerged strengthened through all\ndifficulties.\n       Today, we have to see as to how we can rid the society of its evils. Is\nit through violence or agitations? Can we remove the evils through fighting\nagainst one another? The problems are complex, and we have to get\ntogether and see how we can solve them. Of course, it is the responsibility\nof the Government, but can't every individual citizen do his bit? Can't our\nbrothers and sisters refrain from buying things, which are not available in\nthe open market, but are available only in the black-market? Can't our other\nbrothers and sisters grow vegetables in pots and cans if they have no land\nattached to their houses, keep their city clean, and help in eradicating evil\npractices prevalent in their neighbourhood? Every single citizen,\nnotwithstanding the class he belongs to and his resources, can put in his\nmite which will not only be in his own interest but in the interest of the\nnation.\n      Unfortunately, we are prone to lapsing into complacency when\nsomething good comes about. But when there is some difficulty, we all give\nup hope. Sometimes, it seems that the entire nation has adopted a\ndefeatist attitude. No problem has been solved by giving up hope. I have\nenumerated some of the problems. There are other problems too. For\ninstance, our population is rising at a tremendous rate and the people of all\nclasses are demanding more of everything. Today, a cycle, a motorcycle, a\ntractor or a transister is a common sight in the villages, although nobody\ncould even dream of it only some years back. All this is, of course, good. If\nwe are to raise the living standards of our people, we have to control our\nincreasing population.\n      We are redoubling our efforts to strengthen our country. We will never\nrelapse into idleness. Recently, we exploded a nuclear device, through\nwhich we gained more self-confidence. Some countries criticised us. There\nwere also some misunderstandings and some people utilised this\nopportunity to denigrade us. But, we have made it clear that whatever\nenergy we have, nuclear or non-nuclear, we will utilise it for the benefit of\nthe people and will co-operate for its development.\n      In the international field, there have been many incidents and many\nnew forces have come to the fore. India has always tried to maintain\nfriendship with all and, as you are aware, friendship has indeed increased.\nYou must have seen how we entered into agreements with our\nneighbouring countries. This we did to lessen tension, and I think we have\nset an example for the whole world. But all of our neighbours have, in spite\nof our efforts, not learnt anything from our experience. Some of our\nneighbouring countries are trying to threaten us even today. We hope that\npeace will not be disturbed, and all the poor developing countries will be\nable to devote themselves to the task of social and economic progress, and\ntheir attention will not be diverted. But, life is such that no matter how much\nour internal difficulties, we cannot afford to neglect the external dangers.\nWe have to remain ever vigilant.\n       Our country has become stronger in the past few years. In our long\nhistory, there have been difficulties, and you are aware of the problems we\nhave had to face- of the wars we had to fight and the millions of refugees\nwe had to care for. In spite of this, we kept on with our development\nactivities and we will keep on doing so. I only have to tell you not to be\ndisheartened, and have courage and faith in the country's future and in\nIndia's people.\n      Sometimes, there is discontent and unrest among the youth. This is\nnatural. But, how is this energy to be utilised? Should we dissipate our\nenergies or utilise them for some progressive purpose? The youth require a\nstrong India more than we, and the country also needs energetic young\nmen. Today, we have to dedicate ourselves to the task of tearing asunder\nthe dark curtain and to see the bright future of the country. No country has\nbeen able to mould its future without passing through difficulties and\ndangers. If we are to mould our history, we have to progress rapidly and\nwean away from all such factors like poverty, disunity, social evils and\ndespair, which weaken a nation.\n       There are many children in front of me and whenever I see them, my\nmind is diverted to the other children living in the villages and the cities.\nWhat kind of future are we to mould for them? Our age is a link between\nour glorious past and our bright future. A great responsibility devolves on\nus. Let us get together to shoulder these responsibilities and to turn into\nreality the hopes that we nurture for our children. Due to our policies of\npeace and friendship, of strengthening India and of bringing about unity\nand socialism in our country, India has gained respect abroad. It is the\nresponsibility of all of us to see that this prestige increases. India is strong,\nbut not as much as it should be.\n       India will become strong only when this mist of despair is lifted and\nwhen every individual picks up courage. You can give the answer as much\nas I, whether we can achieve this or not. The future of India depends on\neach citizen as much as it depends upon me or the Government. I am\naware that when there are dark clouds, people forget what sunshine is and\nwhat light is, but this does not mean that there is no sunshine or that light\nhas disappeared. Sunshine is there and one, who has the eyes to see and\nalso the strength of soul and mind, can progress himself and help his\ncountry to progress in that direction.\n       This is the lesson we have before us today, because we know that\nour struggle for freedom was not won easily. We had to make sacrifices,\nand only after passing through the days of darkness and despair did we\ncome to the 15th of August, when our tricolour was unfurled for the first\ntime. That tricolour is not a mere piece of cloth. Why do we respect our\nflag? In fact, every country respects its flag. Its brave soldiers are ready to\nlay down their lives for it. Why? Because it is the symbol of the country's\nstrength, its hopes and its greatness. This is the reason that this piece of\ncloth commands so much respect. But, the real respect cannot be made\nmanifest merely through words or merely by unfurling the flag. The real\nrespect lies in creating an atmosphere for our flag to remain high. We keep\nit high during war, but we have to see that in our national, political, social\nand economic life we do not do anything whereby the respect of our flag\ndiminishes in any way in the eyes of other countries and even our own. We\nall have to think over this and decide for ourselves as to how we can keep\nour flag flying high, and how we can strengthen our dear country. We shall\nhave to decide the steps we will have to take for creating a bright future for\nour children and for the youth.\n      August 15 is a day of sacrifice. At the same time, it is also a day on\nwhich we can peep into our future. Unless people of all classes, religions\nand languages are united, we cannot achieve anything. Communalism and\ncasteism can only weaken us. In some respects, their influence has\nweakened, but in other respects it has increased. Now, if we have been\nable to lessen these influences why cannot we eliminate them totally? Why\ncannot we give justice to those who have remained oppressed and to\nwhom justice has been denied all along?\n      When I started my speech I had said that my heart is full with sorrow\nand anxiety, but I want to tell you that this sorrow has in no way\noverwhelmed me to the extent that I cannot visualise the future. There is\nsorrow, there are anxieties and burdens. But, along with these, I can also\nsee a bright future, not a distant one but a near future. I can also see how\nwe have to move step by step, so that we can reach our goal. I have faith\nthat all of you will be able to march forward with the same confidence and\nstrength so that by the next 15th of August we are able to eradicate most of\nthe evils of today and overcome most of today's difficulties and take the\ncountry from darkness to light. To all of you who are here in front of me in\nDelhi and to those listening to me on the radio in all the corners of the\ncountry, I once again extend my greetings and my good wishes for the\nfuture. I will once again tell you that we are all soldiers of India, whether in\nuniform or in civies. Like soldiers, we have to stand straight and march\nforward with courage and determination."},{"year":1973,"pm":"Indira Gandhi","party":"INC","title":"Spirit of Determination","footnote":"Free rendering of speech in Hindi, Red Fort, Delhi, August 15, 1973","source":"Selected Speeches of Indira Gandhi: September 1972-March 1977","text":"Once again we gather at this historic place to celebrate the\nanniversary of our Independence to pledge ourselves to defend our\nNational Flag and to serve our beloved people. Our Independence day falls\nduring the monsoon when the sun and shade intermingle, which is\nsymbolic of the intermingling of joy and sorrow in the life of a nation as\nmuch as in the life of an individual. Ours is a country of farmers. We\nwelcome the rains because the farmers and the entire country depend on\nthis. Our irrigation and power resources and many other programmes\ndepend on the rains. But today, we are under clouds of different kind, the\nclouds of difficulties and sufferings.\n      Our country is suffering from some shortages. The prices have risen\nand and have risen tremendously. We do not wish to conceal this fact, but\nwe should also try to understand as to how these shortages came about.\nYou are aware of the drought, which has affected us during the last to\nparticularly in Maharashtra, Gujarat and Rajasthan, but in Mysore and\nsome other States too the drought has been on an unprecedented scale,\nwhich has not been witnessed during the last 50 years. But our people did\nnot lose heart.\n       I have toured those areas and can vouchsafe for the courage and\nfortitude with which they have faced the drought. The foreigners who went\nthere to see the conditions were surprised to see the people's courage and\ndetermination to face this challenge- whether they dug the land or broke\nstones or were busy in constructing dams. They sang as they worked. No\none complained. If they asked for something it was only the means to\nrehabilitate themselves. We have to spread this spirit of determination\nthrough the entire country.\n      The areas producing millet, maize and groundnut were particularly\naffected by the drought. Thus, the shortages began, the prices increased,\nthe chain reaction of shortages was set in motion, the demand increased\nand the prices rose still further. There were reasons for the price-rise in\nsome cases but in many cases there was no justification for the price-rise.\nThe drought had not affected only our country, but large parts of Asia and\nAfrica as well suffered drought and had to import grains on a large scale.\nThus, the prices of foodgrains rose in other countries and affected the\nprices in our country, too. The prices have risen not only in these countries\nbut even in the affluent and advanced countries of the world.\n      The same story of shortages, sufferings and complaints would be\nrevealed if we go through their newspapers or talk to the peoples of those\ncountries. This does not mean that the causes for price-rise in these\ncountries are the same as in India. In fact, they are totally different. But\nnational boundaries cannot check the economic winds. These affect the\nprices in our country, as these countries have to import the required goods\nwhich lead to higher prices in these countries and which in turn affect the\nprices of goods in our country. Thus, we should see our problems in this\nwider perspective.\n      Some people accuse the Government of extravagance. They ask as\nto where all this money is going? Where has this money gone? Massive\namounts have been spent in providing relief to one crore people affected by\nthe drought and you are aware of the huge amounts which we had to\nspend earlier to look after the refugees from Bangladesh. Then came the\nwar. All this could have been compensated by a good harvest, but it was\nthe other way round and a terrible drought not only wiped out the harvest\nbut even the wells and rivers went dry and inflation increased.\n      The Government is making all efforts to cut down expenditure. We\nhave effected a reduction of Rs. 400 crores in the expenditure\ncontemplated earlier under various programmes for each Ministry and the\nState Governments and every department of the Government has been\nasked to cut its expenditure on non-essential programmes or to temporarily\nshelve them. Some of the essential public services may be affected by this\nreduction but we cannot help it.\n       These are hard times, and as in a family, so in a nation we have to fix\npriorities. India is a large family and we have to mobilise our resources and\nuse them judiciously. In this context, the main responsibility is that of the\nGovernment but in this the public is equally involved to ensure that they too\nreduce their expenditure to the minimum.\n      We all feel annoyed when we hear of black-marketing and shortages,\nwhich the people are facing. But the same goods are sold at higher prices\nin the same shop behind the counter. I have absolutely no doubt that those\nwho hoard or who sell goods in the black market should be dealt with\nseverely and awarded stringent punishment. These people, however, do\nnot belong to a different category. Things are sold in the black market\nbecause there are people to purchase them. If the people are not prepared\nto buy at black market price, the traders would not be able to sell them.\n       We have seen that for whatever reasons, some people have\nobstructed the procurement of foodgrains. If there is a fire, the only\nquestion is how to put it out and nobody questions how and where from the\nwater is to be obtained. Whatever be our food policy, whether it is liked or\nnot, is it not the duty of everybody to see that what is procured and\ndistributed to all equitably or who need it, so that nobody starves? This is\nthe responsibility of the entire community. We are accused that we have\ntaken over the wholesale trade in wheat. Some people think that this has\nled to shortage, but no one can prove that grain would have reached the\nshops if we had not taken this step.\n     According to the information received from various sources, it has\nbeen proved that had we not taken over the wholesale trade in wheat it\nwould not have reached the people and would have gone into the black\nmarket depriving the weaker section of the society. Only those who could\nhave afforded a higher price would have got it. The middle class and the\nurban people have faced difficulty, but we have been able to give grains\nanyhow to those who needed them most. I do not, therefore, accept there\nwas anything wrong in this policy.\n     Another question is that why do we not pay more to the farmer? If we\nnow pay higher price for the wheat it will further affect the price of other\ncommodities. The farmer, no doubt, would have got more but it would have\ncaused more hardship to the other section of the population. We all have to\nswim together. Thus, some people may benefit but the rest will suffer.\n        During the struggle in Bangladesh, when the people were rejoicing, I\nhad warned that the country would have to pay a heavy price for it in terms\nof economic and social tensions. And so it happened, and the Government\nis fully prepared to meet this challenge. I assure you on this occasion that\nthe Government is determined to solve the problem of shortages, rising\nprices and take strong action against anti-social elements. Some steps are\nbeing taken. Programmes have been chalked out and others will be\ninitiated. But no one can do miracles alone, no Government can solve all\nproblems by itself.\n      We have democracy in our country under which people have got\nmany rights and have to bear many responsibilities. Unless everybody\nshares responsibility in this matter, the situation cannot improve. As I said,\nif some people sell at a higher price and others are prepared to pay that\nprice, then this malady cannot be checked. The people have to be alert.\n      It is necessary that the Government reduces its expenditure but it is\nalso incumbent on the people to cut down their expenses. I do know that\nthere are people in our country who are too poor to reduce their\nexpenditure as they are not getting enough even today. There is a vast\nnumber who can hardly make both ends meet. In our present-day society\nthe standard of living has gone up. Certain consumer items not heard of\nearlier have become daily necessities. Who should decide to make due\nwith the minimum?\n       Fortunately, there has been good rain this year, but it would take\nsome months for the new crop to reach the market and we have to make\narrangements till that time. We seek the people's cooperation to manage\nwith the stocks in hand and with what is being imported to stall any serious\nsituation. All the housewives and others should scrupulously avoid waste.\nThis would enable us to tide over the difficult months ahead.\n      The people should not take the law into their own hands to deal with\nthe hoarders and profiteers but inform the concerned authorities. We have\nto create an atmosphere against hoarding. Some people think that it is only\nthrough agitations and bandhs that their grievances could be heard. But\nhere does this lead to ? The work stops, there is disorder and violence and\nthe very items we need become scarce. The prices go up. If there is loot\nthere will not be proper distribution; prices will further go up and there will\nbe strikes. You must have seen in Delhi and other places how people have\nto face difficulties.\n      It is the farmer who feeds the people and who forms the backbone of\nour economy. It is his bounden duty to increase production and make it\navailable to the Government so that equitable distribution is ensured. First,\nwe have to increase production, procure foodgrains and then distribute it\namong the people. In this we all have to co-operate.\n      Action has been taken to step up arrangements for increasing\nproduction of power, agricultural products and the situation is steadily\nimproving. Along with the demand for personal freedom, we have also to\nensure that there is no violence and the people maintain law and order. If\nthere is a clash, it is the common man who has to bear the brunt.\n       Employees also form an important section of the society. Our\nprogress, specially industrial growth, depends upon them. They too have\ndemands. I realise that strike is an instrument to achieve these demands.\nBut, there are times in the life of a nation when individual demands and\nindividual needs have to be set aside, in the larger interest of the country\nand the society. We hope that no factory will be closed. Mill-owners and\nindustrialists, whatever their difficulties, will bear them anyhow and see that\nthe mills and factories continue to function. In the same manner, I would\nrequest the employees to solve their problems through mutual discussions\nand negotiations. But under no circumstances should there be a let-up in\nproduction. This is the time to take such a decision and act with a sense of\nresponsibility.\n      Similarly, the common man has also to understand and realise his\nresponsibilities and obligations. Certain things we can tell and other people\ncan also think and tell us. Our democracy does not mean that you only cast\nyour vote. The people of the country voted for us in the elections and we\nhave tried to take such steps which would enable even the smallest man to\nhave confidence and raise the prestige of India. This has happened. But\neven after this can we say we have all carried out our responsibilities?\n      Our ancient scriptures teach us to maintain equanimity during trials\nand tribulations, amidst stresses and strains, and not to lose our\nperspective in joy or sorrow. But, what actually happens is that any happy\ndevelopment sends us into ecstasy, while a small difficulty is enough to\nplunge us into despair. The question is whether we want to be a nation of\nthose who cry, complain or quit in the face of difficulty or a country of the\ncourageous, who squarely and boldly face their trials and privations. This\nquestion has to be answered today in our country by the young and the\naged alike.\n      In this gathering today, there are many freedom fighters of yore, old\nin years no doubt but young at heart. Their zest for life and enthusiasm is\nas intense as of any man in his thirties, forties and fifties. Today, we seek\nthe co-operation of these young veterans to guide us, to imbue us with their\ncourage and determination.\n       Rains or no rains, the country must forge ahead. The programmes\nhave to be completed. In war or peace, we do not wish to slacken the pace\nof our progress. Some people counsel a 'Plan Holiday'. This is dangerous,\nfor, this implies mortgaging India’s future to present comforts, ignoring\ncompletely the country's poor. There cannot and there will not be any 'Plan\nHoliday'.\n      When I last spoke to you here, I had mentioned the changes coming\nabout in the international scene. These changes continue and new\nfriendships are giving a new complexion to this scene. This continent is still\nto reach the kind of peace and adjustments it should have reached. People\nblame us. I will not repeat here the story of the prisoners-of-war of which\nyou are all well aware. The Government of Bangladesh and our own have\nmade some proposals, generous proposals, which have been hailed\nthroughout the world. Negotiations are continuing and will be resumed in a\nfew days. But, should these negotiations fall through, the people of India,\nthe people of Pakistan and the whole world will know that the Governments\nof India or Bangladesh cannot be blamed for this. They will know who is\nresponsible for the prisoners not going back to their country and who is\ncreating obstruction.\n       We have together faced many a hurdle. Sometimes we came out\nflying colours, sometimes success eluded us. Now we face our acid test as\na nation and if we are able to tackle it resolutely and courageously, we will\nhave a future ahead of us burnished and bright like gold tried by fire. And,\nso will be our people.\n      I will repeat my question today : What kind of a future are we aiming\nat? We want a people whose hopes will never be shattered. We want a\npeople whose voice, the voice of peace and friendship, is echoed in all\ncorners of the world. Our great leaders held up to us the ideals- of a new\nworld, of a new vision- and we have to fulfil their promises. But that is not\nenough.\n      A new generation has come up. I hope this new generation will be the\nharbinger of a new light. They will be disciplined and brave and will show\nthe veterans present here that they are second to none. They will build a\nNew India."},{"year":1972,"pm":"Indira Gandhi","party":"INC","title":"Fight Against Poverty","footnote":"Free translation of speech in Hindi from the ramparts of Red Fort, Delhi, August 15, 1972","source":"The years of endeavour: selected speeches of Indira Gandhi, August 1969-August 1972","text":"Twenty-five years ago our National Flag was unfurled for the first time\nhere at this spot. The entire nation awoke into a new life that day. Last\nnight we paid our homage to those thousands of people whose services\nand sacrifices led us to freedom. Different types of people took part in our\nfreedom struggle. Many among them were great revolutionaries but most of\nthem joined the non-violent non-co-operation movement. It was the\nsacrifices of all of them which roused freedom consciousness in the country\nand forced the British to quit India. There were several others like men of\nthe Garhwal Regiment, the Naval Ratings of Bombay and the I.N.A. who\nmade many sacrifices for the cause of our freedom. There were so many of\nthem that it is rather difficult to name them all. Most of them are no more\nwith us now and we pay our homage to them. We also express our\ngratitude to others whom we are fortunate to have in our midst today. It is\ntheir selfless service and great sacrifices that brought us freedom.\n      Twenty-five years ago when we unfurled our flag here it was not the\nend of our fight but a beginning of a new fight— a fight against poverty and\na fight to make freedom a reality for our teeming millions. All of us are\npartners in this great struggle and have to go a long way to achieve our\nobjectives. We have to ensure a better life for our children and find more\njobs for our young men. During the last 25 years we have covered a long\njourney, a journey not of comforts alone but of many hardships, difficulties\nand dangers. But, as you know, we are today stronger than ever before; we\nare more resolute and united and our democratic institutions have taken\ndeeper roots.\n      However, we have to see that the pace of our progress is accelerated\nand we fulfil our pledges. As you know we have made some progress and\nhave a number of achievements to our credit. But I regret to say that there\nare some people in our country who even question these achievements.\nThey even questioned the desirability of our celebrating the Silver Jubilee\nof our Independence. This is a strange attitude and very difficult to\nunderstand. Can't they see the progress we have made so far? Perhaps\nthey can't or perhaps they don't like it.\n      There is a mighty upsurge in India today and we all should try to gear\nourselves to meet the challenges before us. We should strive for unity and\nstrength to achieve our objectives. Any temporary difficulty or our failure to\ndo things should not lead us to believe that there has been no progress.\nWe do make mistakes sometimes but these cannot nullify our\nachievements. While we criticise ourselves for our shortcomings, we should\nnot overlook our many achievements. We have to do some heart-searching\nand decide what the shape of things should be.\n        Almost every year, as you know, we face droughts in some parts of\nthe country and floods in others. These bring misery and sufferings in their\ntrail. But the impact of such tragedies today is not the same as it used to be\nyears before. Previously, whenever there was drought in rural areas there\nwas hardly any assistance from outside. But things are quite different now.\nWe take immediate steps to rush aid to the affected areas and face the\ncalamity unitedly. We cannot stop these calamities. We cannot prevent the\nvagaries of nature but we can always face them unitedly. A significant\ndevelopment we see is the increasing self-reliance among our people and\na belief that they alone are the masters of their destiny. This is our greatest\nasset and a source of our real strength.\n       As you know we have made considerable progress in the fields of\nagriculture and industry. Twenty-five years ago when we became free our\ncondition was really bad and we were full of anxiety. We were faced with so\nmany problems and it looked as if we would not be able to solve them.\nMany people thought that India would not be able to preserve her\nindependence. But these people were proved wrong. We were successful\nin solving our problems one by one. During these years we have made\nsignificant progress. Food production in the country has increased, a large\nnumber of new factories have come up. All the critical and complex\nproblems were solved one by one. Production of steel and electricity has\nincreased. Many heavy machines, which we were formerly importing, are\nnow being manufactured in the country. The development of heavy industry\nhas enabled us to manufacture other machines indigenously. It is true that\nour production has not kept pace with the increasing demand. The more we\nproduce the more we need to meet our demand which is largely due to\nrapid increase in our population. So we are always faced with the problem\nof how to meet the demand which is increasing day by day. Some people\ndo not see things in proper perspective and try to belittle the achievements.\nSuch persons who close their eyes to the realities are no friends of the\npeople.\n       I would like to take this opportunity to thank our Armed Forces for\ntheir heroic and courageous deeds. These brave soldiers and officers of\nour Army, Navy and Air Force have made great sacrifices to safeguard\nfreedom of the country which has been attacked five times. I firmly believe\nthat the freedom of India will always be safe in their hands. We express our\ngratitude and sympathies to the families of our brave soldiers and officers\nwho lost their lives in the fighting. All of us including our army and police\nhave to make a united effort to uplift the country. We fully realise that the\nreal strength of a nation depends on its progress, on its ideology, on the\nunity of its people, on the readiness of its people to make sacrifices. We\nsee lot of tension in the world today. The real question before us is whether\nwe want to fritter away our energies in useless agitations and quarrels or\nwhether we want to look into our future and act to make it really\nprosperous.\n      Today we find restlessness among our youth and others. This\nrestlessness is not peculiar to us alone. This is a universal phenomenon\ntoday. Maybe, in India it is because of unemployment, maybe, it is because\nof poverty, but why we see this restlessness among youth in other\ncountries where there is no unemployment or poverty. To my mind this\nrestlessness is because we are emerging from one age and entering into\nanother. And when such great transformation takes place it is bound to\nresult in some restlessness, sorrow and suffering. We cannot remain stuck\nto the old order nor can we wish that there should be no change. We want\nto play our part in this change. These changes are of various kinds. In India\nwe have poverty and it is necessary that we implement our development\nprogrammes speedily to eradicate poverty and create conditions conducive\nto these changes. We have done a lot of things in this direction but we\nhave still to do much more. To meet the unemployment problem we have to\nenforce programmes to remove it as soon as possible. It is not possible for\nme to go into details at the moment but these programmes have been\nexplained in the Parliament and placed before the people at other forums.\nSome of these have already been undertaken and others are still to be\ntaken up. These programmes have been designed to meet both the\nimmediate and future conditions. There are many problems which we must\nsolve. We cannot wait passively for their solutions. We ourselves have to\nshape our future. We want that every Indian should have a hand in shaping\nour destiny. It is true that we are now free but, as I said earlier yet to make\nthis freedom real for our teeming millions. We have to build a society in\nwhich each individual can enjoy full freedom- economic, social and political.\nIn fact, we have to build this kind of world society. We cannot isolate\nourselves from the world today. We do not covet anyone's territory. We do\nnot want to interfere in others’ affairs. We want others also to follow the\ncorrect way like us. I think we have in the last few months shown the world\nsomething. You all know how we last year met the aggression against us.\nOur forces fought heroically and achieved a real victory. In fact it was a\nvictory of an ideology, a way of thinking and the world could see it. This\nvictory has given strength to India and has created unity and enthusiasm\namong our people.\n       We have never made an attack on anybody, nor have we tried to\npressurise anyone. In fact, there are some who have tried to pressurise us.\nBut, as you know, we have resisted all such pressures. We carefully\nchoose our own way and do not get swayed by the currents. As you know\nthere is not any readymade way. We ourselves have to make it, step by\nstep, and it is possible we may sometimes make mistakes or grow\ncomplacent but it has to be of our own making. A nation's character like an\nindividual's is built the hard way. The real strength of a man is his character\nand only a man who works hard is a man of character and not the one who\nleads a life of ease and extravagance. We do not want a nation which only\nloves ease and comforts. We want a people who love working hard for their\nlivelihood, a people who struggle to create better opportunities of life not\nonly for themselves but for others also. I think our freedom will be complete\nonly when we are able to create such conditions for our people.\n        I strongly feel that our independence would not be complete so long\nas we do not completely eliminate casteism from our society. We all must\nthink as equals, citizens of India, an ancient country, which gave to the\nworld a unique culture and high ideals. We have to show the world that we\nstill value those high ideals whatever be our religion. There are many\nreligions in India. If we follow our religion sincerely there can be no quarrels\namong us. No true religion teaches us to suppress those belonging to other\nreligions. Toleration of others' views has been our tradition. We must\nmaintain and strengthen this glorious tradition so that the entire mankind\nbenefits from it.\n      I mentioned about our old revolutionaries and freedom fighters who\nare still in our midst today. We want inspiration from them. We want their\nblessings in shaping the future of this great country. To the young\ngeneration of India, I give my good wishes. It is they who are to build the\nIndia of our dreams. They are the custodians of the honour and security of\nIndia. Let us pledge ourselves to build a clean, progressive and a great\nBharat.\n         The way this country will move forward is not yet known and I cannot\ntell it. But I know that an inner force, a new life is struggling to be born. With\nits birth, humanity will find a new way, a way to peace and co-operation\namong mankind which will make the world one family.\n      We have to remove not only economic poverty but the penury of our\nthinking. We have to bring about a new way of thinking. Our young men\nsometimes go astray and make mistakes but they have the strength to\ndeliver the goods. It is time we make the best use of all the strength and\nknowledge that we possess to take the country forward so that it is able to\nhelp the rest of the world in moving along the correct path.\n      Recently, as you know, we have tried to come to an agreement with\nour neighbouring country. People ask me if I trust that country or not. My\nanswer to them is that I trust only one country and that is India. We have to\ntrust our people, our unity and our strength. We want that there should\nalways be friendship and peace in this sub-continent so that we can march\nforward speedily."},{"year":1971,"pm":"Indira Gandhi","party":"INC","title":"Need for Unity","footnote":"Free translation of speech in Hindi from the ramparts of Red Fort, Delhi, August 1971","source":"The years of endeavour: selected speeches of Indira Gandhi, August 1969-August 1972","text":"The month of August has a great significance in the life of our nation.\nEvery year we meet here not merely to see each other but to salute our flag\nwhich is a symbol of our independence. It is also a symbol of our heroes\nwho laid down their lives for independence and of those who are willing to\nsacrifice their lives even today.\n      Many of you who have assembled here and millions of others in their\nhomes, fields and factories today want to know how far the country has\nmoved towards its goal and how far from it it still remains. Truly speaking,\nthe journey of a country never ends. However fast and long we may move,\nthe distance always remains to be covered.\n      Many significant things have happened in our country during the last\nyear. First of all, I must thank you for proving wrong what many of us here\nand abroad were saying about India and its people. In the biggest election\never held anywhere you have shown that the people of this country are fully\naware of their rights and their duties. Despite many a difficulty, you did not\ndesist from exercising your vote even at places where there was risk to life.\nYou did not vote for a person or even for a party but you voted for the\nprogressive programmes and policies which had been put by us before\nyou.\n       Since then, as you know, we have been trying to do things and have\ntaken some preliminary steps towards achieving those objectives which we\nhad placed before you. Poverty is a terrible condition which brings\nfrustration to the people and weakens the country. Therefore, our first task\nis to remove poverty. We have to remove social and economic disparities\nto achieve our objectives. As you are aware, we have taken some\nsignificant steps in that direction and are striving to remove obstacles in our\nway.\n       In the last session of Parliament we passed a Bill for amending the\nConstitution. This disturbed some people. There was some misleading\npropaganda to the effect that the land and other properties of the people\nwould be taken away. Some members of the minority communities felt that\ntheir rights might be affected. I have said it before and I wish to reiterate my\nassurance here today once again that we will not take away anything from\nanyone. We only wish that the benefits of affluence which some of us enjoy\nshould also accrue to those who have nothing so that the strength of the\nnation grows. There is already a ceiling on land which varies from State to\nState. We hope this problem will be reviewed and appropriate action taken\nto give relief to our landless farmers and other weaker sections of the rural\ncommunity so that they too can play a useful role in the life of the\ncommunity. They have to be partners in our efforts to improve life in our\nvillages. There is also a proposal to put a ceiling on urban property. We\nare, therefore, determined to implement our programmes one after the\nother. Some of these programmes have already been implemented, while\nothers are still to be implemented.\n       After the General Election, when your representatives assembled\nhere in Delhi, you had, like us, very high hopes. We thought that we would\nbe able to make progress rapidly. However, suddenly and for no fault of\nours, we were burdened with a problem which we had never imagined. But\nyou know that the people of India have been able to carry many burdens\nand will continue to do so in future as well. We know that the inner strength\nthat our citizens have, whether they are soldiers or civilians, old or young,\nwill enable us to surmount all the difficulties that may come in our way.\n      I do know that quite a few things have happened that have disturbed\nyou. At the same time many things have happened that have strengthened\nour hopes. The brave manner in which our people faced many difficulties,\ncarrying various burdens and coming to each other's help, is a matter of\npride for all of us. We, as citizens of India, have to see that we defend not\nonly our own rights but also the rights of those who are unable to raise their\nvoice. This, obviously, is not a Government responsibility but a\nresponsibility of every citizen. As you know, we still suffer from the age-old\ndisparities and inequalities. These disparities give us a bad name and\nweaken the country.\n      The removal of economic disparities is, of course, the responsibility of\nthe State but it is the people who have to remove social inequalities. The\ngreat responsibility of uniting India and strengthening it lies with the people.\n       Another problem which we, and particularly my sisters, face today is\nof rising prices. The price spiral affects all of us and it should be our\nendeavour that the prices of essential commodities remain at reasonable\nlevel. Why do prices rise? Sometimes, when a commodity is in short\nsupply, there is a rise in its price and one can understand it. But many\ntimes when a particular item is taxed, other items which are in no way\nrelated to it also register rise in prices. Who raises these prices and why?\nObviously, they are the unscrupulous dealers. You have to be alert and\norganise yourself to see that this does not happen in your locality. You\nmust realise your responsibility as citizens whether it be about price rise or\nany other matter.\n       As you all know, India has faced many challenges. But the challenge\nthat confronts us today is such as has never been faced by any country in\nthe world. All these years while we had been striving to give our people\ntheir rights, things had been going on just the other way across our\nborders. Elections were held there just as elections were held in our\ncountry. As in India people there too came out in large numbers to vote but\nwhereas we have been trying to fulfil our promises, a great tragedy has\nhappened there. As a result of the atrocities inflicted on them over 7.5\nmillion people, many of them wounded, sick and starved, had to leave their\nhomes and take shelter in India. We have always kept our doors open for\nrefugees. But they are not merely refugees; they are partners in a\nmovement which is very significant. It is a movement similar to the one we\nhad in our own country, and also in many other countries to secure the\nrights of the people. We cannot overlook the heavy price these people from\nBangladesh are paying for the freedom of their country.\n       We have thus to keep the wider issues in view and surmount all the\ndifficulties that may come in our way. We cannot overlook the bigger issues\njust because there are some difficulties. We have to face these difficulties\nand do our utmost to overcome them. We must also be aware of the factors\non account of which we in this country have adhered to the principles of\ndemocracy and to our constitution and have been trying to give concrete\nshape to them for the good of our people at a time when nations around us\nhave bid goodbye to democracy and constitutions. We must continue to\nmaintain our traditional values. We have to safeguard our freedom and\ndemocracy and make them really meaningful for our people.\n       As you know, it has always been our policy to carry our people with\nus. Our foreign policy has always been of seeking peace and friendship.\nWe hate war and do not indulge in sabre-rattling. We do not raise slogans\nwhich can hurt others. It is because we know that the real strength lies not\nin words but in our strengthening the country both economically and\npolitically. This is how we look at things. We do not threaten anyone nor are\nwe scared by anyone's threats. We are confident that India can and will\nface any emergency with courage and determination.\n      You are aware that there have been floods in some parts of the\ncountry and severe drought in some others so that even drinking water is\nnot available at some places. Despite all this, enough food has been\nproduced in the country. There is some shortage of pulses and oilseeds.\nOn the whole, there is no shortage of foodgrains. But we have to feed not\nonly our own people. Just now, we are also feeding a large number of\npeople from another land.\n       Every lover of freedom and of humanity is bound to raise his voice\nagainst events in Bangladesh, India has to see whether the steps that she\ntakes or the slogans that are raised here strengthen the people of that\ncountry. I assure you that India and her people will always support the\ncause of freedom everywhere. The people of Bangladesh have our full\nsupport. This is time for us not to feel disheartened, however great the\ncrisis. There never was any reason for feeling disappointed. We have\nproved that we have faith and self-confidence and that we can stand up to\nany crisis, and make whatever sacrifices are necessary. There is no reason\nfor us to doubt that we have a bright future.\n      As we see today, a wave of change is sweeping this country and also\nother countries. No one can remain unaffected by this new wave of change.\nThis wave will engulf all of us. However, we do not have to fear it because\nwe are swimming with the current. In fact, we are giving a direction to this\ncurrent and we know that we are ready to face whatever the future may\nbring us.\n       On this auspicious day our fullest sympathies are with those who\nhave to undergo suffering either because of floods or drought or poverty or\nany other kind of injustice. I say to them: Be courageous and lend us your\nhand. We will do everything to help them and take our beloved India\nforward. For all of us this is the time to be ready to face whatever\ndifficulties, sufferings and dangers there may be.\n      The people of India may be poor or illiterate. But this has been a land\nof heroes and such has been its history. There is no reason for us to fear or\nto withdraw from the path we have chosen. Only one thing we have to keep\nin mind—that we adhere firmly to our traditional policy of secularism.\n       Recently, we entered into a treaty with the Soviet Union. Some\npeople think that as a result of this treaty there has been a change in our\npolicy. I can assure you that there has been no change in our policy\nbecause it is the right policy. It is not as though we cannot ever change our\npolicy. But the policy we have so far followed is the one most suited to\nconditions that have so far existed and is based on principles that we value\nmost. Today we see that many countries, whether they admit it or not, are\ninclined towards this policy. In fact, for countries like India no other policy\ncan be of any good. Therefore, we have to stick to the basic values\nwhether they flow out of our traditions or from our present-day politics.\n      In our day-to-day work we do make mistakes. However, we should be\nbold enough to accept them and always ready to correct them. We have\nmade many changes in our policies and would continue to do so whenever\nnecessary so that we are able to put our poor people on their feet and\nmake India strong. World history tells us that a country does not progress\nthrough the barrel of a gun. A country makes progress only when its people\nare served well, when they are strong and when the Government is run\nwith their consent.\n      Whatever our party or political ideology, we should be united for the\ndefence, unity and territorial integrity of our country. Today we should have\nonly one slogan and that should be : Let us be one, let us be courageous\nand let us march forward.\n       Whether in uniform or without it, all of you should regard yourselves\nas soldiers of the land and be determined to lay down your lives, if\nnecessary, in the cause of the country. We are all soldiers today and shall\nfight for freedom and the advancement of humanity."},{"year":1970,"pm":"Indira Gandhi","party":"INC","title":"A New Awakening","footnote":"Free translation of speech in Hindi from the ramparts of Red Fort, Delhi, August 15, 1970","source":"The years of endeavour: selected speeches of Indira Gandhi, August 1969-August 1972","text":"Independent India today enters the twenty-fourth year of her freedom.\nEvery year, on the banks of the Yamuna, at this Red Fort, the people and\nthose who serve them meet one another, and derive strength from one\nanother. The country has witnessed many changes in the past one year.\nThere has been a rethinking by the various political parties and the people\non various issues. All of them have been trying to clarify their policies and\nlooking for new paths. The people had an opportunity to strengthen\ndemocracy and to take stock of their progress.\n      The past year had been a year of great revival of activity. Earlier,\nmany programmes had been left unexecuted either because of war,\ndrought, economic recession or other reasons. We are again marching\nforward but certain forces are perturbed by the speed of the progress we\nare making and are opposing the steps we are taking. However, I know that\nthe people are aware of what is going on, of what is right and what is wrong\nand what is good and what is bad. The people have the capacity to\ndiscriminate between good and evil. Herein lies the value of democracy.\nReal power vests in the people.\n      Ever since I was elected to this office I have been touring the four\ncorners of our country. And never before, as in the last year, have I found\nour people so alert, so awakened, and so aware of their rights. Never\nbefore have I seen them so hopeful and so ready to welcome the new\nchanges. This is both a good sign and a great challenge to us. We have to\nface this challenge.\n      As I said earlier, many programmes which could not be implemented\nare being carried out now. Production in both agriculture and industry has\nincreased and is continuing to increase. Nationalisation of banks has\nthrown open new avenues to the people, particularly to the youth of the\ncountry. Though it is more than a year since nationalisation of banks took\nplace, the fruits of nationalisation have started accruing to the people only\nduring the last few months. As you know, the implementation could be\nstarted only after the matter was cleared by the Supreme Court.\n      These days we hear strange slogans being raised. Some people talk\nof violence. But I want to tell them that violence has so far not solved any\nproblem. However noble our objectives may be, if we adopt wrong means\nwe cannot achieve these objectives satisfactorily. I had thought that the\ndebate between violence and non-violence had already been settled in our\ncountry. During our independence struggle we had disproved the belief of\nthose who felt that we could not achieve independence through\nnon-violence. We proved to the world that it was possible to free our\ncountry by means of non-violence.\n      I want to assure you that even economic progress and all big\nchanges can be brought about in our country through non-violence. It is our\nduty to rise above ‘slogan-mongering' and unitedly find out ways and\nmeans of doing some solid work. Some of our young men think that they\nhave discovered a new way of revolution. I can understand the\ndisappointment and restlessness which is felt by them. I do believe that\nrestlessness is not always a bad sign. But I appeal to them to first see in\nwhich way the interests of their country can be best served, whether these\ninterests can be served by raising slogans and by indulging in destruction\nand sabotage.\n       We are today facing some big and difficult problems. Price increase is\none. This is, in fact, a big problem. When prices rise, the common people\nfeel the pinch, particularly those belonging to the fixed income groups, as\nalso the workers. We are very much exercised over it. However, you have\nalso to appreciate the fact that when a nation goes forward prices move up\nto a certain extent. Doubtless, it is our duty to ensure that the prices of\nessential commodities are stabilised and there is a balance between\nincomes and prices. At the same time, we know that when prices of\nfoodgrains go down, our peasants and those living in rural areas are\nadversely affected. This adds to their burden. We have therefore to weigh\nevery issue very carefully and then find a middle path. Thus, if there is any\ndistress it will be evenly distributed and no one individual will suffer more\nthan another. We are seriously exercised over the problem of the “haves”\nand “have-nots”, between those who have everything in excess, whether\nurban property or anything else, and others who have very much less. As\nalready announced, we are going to take some action in this matter.\n       With our march forward, we will have also to be careful that there is\nno setback to our production. Any slowing down in our pace of progress will\nconsiderably affect our ability to help the poor and the down-trodden. I\nknow that many people feel that the country is not going ahead with\nsufficient speed. I am, however, confident that the path we have chosen is\nbound to accelerate our progress and, by taking new steps, we would be\nable to forge ahead.\n      This is not the time for minor changes here and there. We have to\nbring about great changes. Gandhiji and Pandit Nehru have shown us how\nbig changes can be brought about through the strength of the people.\n       When I was thirteen years old, my father gave me some advice in the\nletter he wrote from jail. He told me not to do anything secretly and not to\ndo any work which it might be necessary to hide from others. By adopting\nthis principle in our struggle for freedom, Gandhiji could give it a non-violent\ncharacter and it became a source of strength for the weakest among us. All\nparties, organisations and the people should work in the open so that the\npeople are able to understand them and help and co-operate with them.\nThis is the essence of democracy.\n      It must be admitted that our economic condition has improved\nconsiderably. Along with progress our problems have multiplied, for\nprogress creates problems and sometimes problems show the way to\nprogress. Our problems are like a mountain which we climb. We cannot\nafford to look back and see how far we have climbed. We have only to think\nof how much more remains to be climbed. For that purpose we have to rally\ntogether.\n       This is the approach we have to adopt in the matter of price\nstabilisation and in creating employment opportunities for our youth. Where\nprice increase is inevitable we have to put up with it. Many employment\navenues have been suggested, some within the Plan and some outside the\nPlan. I hope our young men will take advantage of these and explore new\nways so that they can stand on their own feet and be self-reliant. The youth\nin advanced countries have shown how self-reliant they can be.\n      We have started implementing youth employment schemes. Some\nyoung men are receiving assistance from the banks. Some get assistance\nfrom other sources. All these schemes will serve as effective instruments\nfor providing employment to the unemployed young. It must be realised that\neverybody cannot at once get job suited to him. We are on a journey which\nis long and arduous and we can reach our destination only step by step.\nAlready many steps have been taken on this journey with courage and\nenthusiasm. When our young men join us in this march they would be able\nto take us all forward more speedily.\n       Undoubtedly there is need for economic and social transformation. At\nthe same time there are certain difficulties which come in the way of such\ntransformation. Recently, there was a new problem. A new slogan had\nbeen coined : “Land Grab”. I do not want to say anything at length about\nthis on this occasion. I will confine myself to only saying that some people\nhave too much land whereas some have no land at all. This is not just. We\nhave taken a few steps in this direction which have given relief to some\npeople. It is our duty to see that the Acts which were passed with this end\nin view are immediately enforced. Whether this is done by the Central or\nthe State Governments, implementation must be done honestly and\neffectively. The Central Government are doing their best to persuade the\nState Governments to implement these reforms speedily and thereby\ndischarge their responsibility. Necessary legislation which has not yet been\npassed will soon be passed. But, however strongly we may feel about it, it\nwould not be just possible to give land to everybody. The problem before\nus now is how to distribute the fallow land that is good. We are\nconcentrating our attention on this and I hope that this will be done more\nexpeditiously.\n       We still face yet another problem, which is frequently and widely\ndiscussed. That is the problem of communalism. One of the many great\nqualities possessed by our country, not from the modern period but from\ntime immemorial, is that it has treated all religions on the basis of perfect\nequality. We have equally respected the different philosophies and creeds\nof all the religions. This has not meant the individual departing from his own\nreligion. But we have always given shelter in our country to others,\nirrespective of their faith.\n      I have often asked myself as to what is really Indian. Our ancient\nsaints and sages have told us that Truth is one but there are several paths\nto reach it. We have always accepted this fundamental truth. If we forget it\nwe will weaken ourselves, and if we remember it we will go from strength to\nstrength.\n      This is an age when the people of one country learn from the\nexperience of other countries. This is not a sign of weakness but the sign of\na new age. We can learn a great deal in the field of science and technology\nand use this knowledge for the removal of poverty of our people. Change is\nthe law of life and the changes taking place in the world today are of\nentirely different kinds. Basic changes are coming about. That is the reason\nwhy there is so much turmoil, turmoil not peculiar to our country alone but\nwhich is sweeping the whole world.\n       The cardinal principle of our foreign policy is world peace. If there is a\ndispute between two parties, they should settle it by mutual discussion\nwithout taking recourse to force. This we have been repeating for years\ntogether. Recently, two developments have given us great happiness. One\nis that President Nasser of the United Arab Republic has accepted the U.S.\npeace proposals for West Asia. Perhaps a complicated problem will be\nsolved by this. President Nasser has displayed courage in accepting these\nproposals. Similarly, Soviet Russia and West Germany have met together\nand signed a non-aggression pact. The point which India has been\nrepeatedly stressing in pursuit of its foreign policy has, it seems, been\naccepted by them. I hope that the result of these two recent developments\nwill prove beneficial to world peace.\n      Unfortunately, in another area, war is still continuing. There, it is not\nonly continuing but it has further enlarged. Many people who have nothing\nto do with it— innocent children, old men and women have also been\nengulfed by it and they are undergoing tremendous suffering. Our heart\ngoes out to them in sympathy.\n       In the United Kingdom, a step which the new government has taken\nafter coming into power has caused us some anxiety. This is their intention\nto give some arms aid to South Africa. We know that this aid would give\nencouragement to the South African Government's policy of colour bar and\napartheid. It would also prove dangerous to the independent countries\nadjoining South Africa. We have raised our voice against this and we hope\nthat the United Kingdom would reconsider her policy.\n      I come here every year and meet the people. It seems to me that the\nassembly gathered here today is larger than in previous years. This may be\ndue to several factors including hopes roused in the hearts of the people,\nas also the realisation that the struggle is a long and difficult one in which\nthey should participate. It is not enough that we enjoy the facilities and\ncomforts which are available in an independent country. We should equally\nshare the miseries, sufferings and burdens that are there. If we look at our\nproblems from this point of view, then we would be able to solve them.\n      There are many people in our midst who do not have strength\nenough to bear any more burdens nor can they march in step with us.\nEvery year we remember them on this occasion. So long as we are not in a\nposition to render more help to these people we will not be able to\naccomplish anything, however laudable our programmes for their\nbetterment may be.\n        I realise that the Harijans, the tribals, those living in the mountains\nand forests and those on whom the burden of poverty is the heaviest have\nbeen the least cared for after Independence. There are many reasons for\nthis state of affairs. In some cases, even if there is a programme for their\nuplift, the benefits cannot reach them owing to lack of communications. We\nshall do our best to help these people, however great the difficulties.\n     We are determined to solve our problems, however complicated they\nmight be. Ours is a great country, but sometimes we are lost in trivial\nmatters. I am a member of a political party. Most of us are members of this\nor that party. Even if you take all these parties together, they are very small\ncompared to the totality of the people of India. We have always to keep the\ngeneral good of our country, its problems, its development and its progress,\nbefore us and not that of any party and have to relegate small matters and\nsmall objectives to the background. Ours is a great country and, therefore,\nwe have always to adopt a high and noble outlook. Gandhiji tried to place\nthis picture of our country before us. Young as we then were, we could not\nunderstand this and were sometimes angry with him. We felt that perhaps\nwe knew more than he did, just as our young men feel today. But now we\nhave started realising the true significance of Gandhiji, and it may be\nseveral decades before people will realise what a great man was amidst\nus. As we realise the extent of his greatness, we should try to shape our\nthoughts and actions accordingly so as to better serve our country. This is\nthe objective we should keep before us. To provide material comforts to the\npeople is the duty of both government and society. But there is a higher\nobjective to be achieved. We want to provide facilities to the people to\nincrease their strength so that all might join in uplifting the country and\nmaking it really great.\n      I had referred earlier to our foreign policy. With the interests of our\ncountry uppermost in our minds, our policy has been to maintain friendship\nwith our neighbouring countries and to arrive at agreements with them, by\nsorting out differences and seeking new ways of co-operation. At the same\ntime we realise that the stronger our society and the greater our unity, the\nmore strongly would we be able to stand up to other nations. You know that\nour brave defence forces, whether they belong to the Army, the Navy or the\nAir Force, and whether stationed in the mountains, the plains, the deserts\nor on the sea coast, are ever prepared to face every danger. Part of their\nstrength lies in the strength of their arms. The other part lies in the strength\nand the support of a strong and united people standing behind them. The\ndefence forces will be relieved of much anxiety with the knowledge of\nstrong support assured from a united people. Today, on my behalf as well\nas on your behalf I offer my good wishes to the Armed Forces, whether\nthey are stationed here or are far away from us.\n       I also offer my good wishes to our peasants and workers, students\nand intellectuals, traders and government employees and to the women of\nIndia, whether they live in cities or in villages. As a servant of this country, I\nrenew my pledge that, with your co-operation I will continue to struggle to\neradicate the poverty in our midst. Gradually, our people are getting\nnation-and-civic conscious. As they come to realise their duty towards the\nbuilding of a glorious future for India, they would be prepared to make any\nsacrifice. Our people are brave and have shown great courage, particularly\nin times of difficulty. Sometimes, however, when we have felt there was no\ndanger, we have tended to relax and become complacent. But, the present\nage is a perilous age, not only for our country but for the whole world.\nWhoever is weak may come to grief. Therefore, it is our duty to remain\nunited and overcome our shortcomings and failings.\n     We have to take determined steps to move forward. All of us should\nask ourselves a question every day. Have you done anything for the\ncountry? Have you done it honestly and industriously? If you are able to get\nhonest answers to these questions, you will soon find that we are able to\naccelerate the pace of progress of this country.\n      Thousands of years ago, Gautama Buddha said: “I am not concerned\nwith what others are not doing. My only concern is with what I do or do not\ndo”. Every citizen should have this ideal before him. Everybody should see\nthat he pursues correct path, that he serves the country and society, and if\nhe does that the society would gather strength. We have to make full use of\nthat strength and knowledge. And I hope that our young men, who are now\nrestless, will become a great source of strength to our society and will be\nable to give a new leadership to the country. I have full faith in them.\nSometimes some of them are led astray but most of them wish to become\nan asset to their country. So all of us who are now not so young should\nhelp these young men.\n    We are citizens of an ancient country which is now becoming a\nmodern one. We would like to build up this country in such a manner that if\nIndia's name is mentioned anywhere or if her citizens go anywhere, there\ngoes with them a new light, a new strength and a new ideology."},{"year":1969,"pm":"Indira Gandhi","party":"INC","title":"New Horizons","footnote":"Free translation of speech in Hindi from the ramparts of Red Fort, Delhi, Independence Day, August 15, 1969","source":"The years of endeavour: selected speeches of Indira Gandhi, August 1969-August 1972","text":"We have assembled once again at this historic place. This day is a\nmilestone in our history and gives us an opportunity to look back on our\nachievements and failures. At the same time it gives us an opportunity to\nlook ahead and see which way we want to go and which way we are going.\n       I give you my best wishes on this day. This is the day when we think\nwith gratitude of our great leaders and the martyrs who laid down their lives\nand sacrificed their all for the good of the country. We think of Mahatma\nGandhi, the Father of the Nation. We think of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose,\nwhose name is linked with this Red Fort. And what Shri Jawaharlal Nehru\nhas done for this country can be seen from one corner of the country to the\nother.\n       The Jallianwala Bagh massacre took place fifty years ago when a\nlarge number of men, women and children, young and old alike, fell victim\nto a storm of bullets. That was a turning point in the freedom struggle of our\ncountry. We observed the 50th anniversary of the tragedy this year. Soon\nafter the massacre, we had pledged ourselves to complete Independence\non the banks of the Ravi. And then at Karachi, at Lucknow, at Avadi and at\nBhubaneswar, we took one big step after another along our chosen path.\n      We all know what has happened in the country during these years\nand the progress we have made in many directions. The production of\nfood-grains has increased. By the abolition of Zamindari we have tried to\nrelieve the distress of our oppressed peasants. The progress in the field of\nindustry is not merely confined to the expansion of existing industries but\nincludes the setting up of many important new industries after the\nattainment of Independence. Our effort has been to establish big industries\nonly in the public sector and to abolish monopoly; but we know that we\nhave been successful in this only to a limited extent. Anyhow, some very\nbig industries have been established in the public sector; and more are\ncoming up. There has been some criticism of this sector, but if an honest\nappraisal is made, we will find that on the whole these enterprises are\ndoing very well.\n      Our peasants particularly are well aware of how they have benefited\nfrom these projects. Their needs of water, electricity and many other things\nhave been met. We also know that there are a few industries which are not\nrunning as satisfactorily as they should, but we are doing our best to\nimprove their condition. These industries are not the property of the\nGovernment but of the people. The earlier they start yielding profits and the\nbetter they function, the more the masses would benefit from them.\n      Our country is forging ahead in every field. Of course, there have\nbeen crises in the life of the nation. The wars on our frontiers, droughts,\ncommunal riots and other disturbances—all these have done some harm to\nthe country. But these difficulties and calamities have also added to our\nexperience. We have learnt a lot from them and they have made our will\nstronger and our steps more resolute.\n        Today we can be sure that we have conquered the darkness. For the\nfirst time in the last three or four years, there is brightness on the horizon.\nWhereas many areas, cities and dwellings are bright with this light, we\ncannot afford to forget those households which are still engulfed in\ndarkness. How can we forget those peasants whose lands have no\nirrigation facilities; how can we forget the crores of Harijans and Girijans\n[hill people] and members of backward tribes who live in mountains and\njungles and whose houses are still denied this brightness. We had given\nthem hope and assurance that after Independence they would have a\nbetter life, but I am afraid their hopes have not been fulfilled.\n       To accomplish these unfinished tasks, we will have to move more\nresolutely towards the goal of socialism we have set ourselves. This path\nhas been chosen by the people of India through the democratic process\nand it continues to have their approval. One very significant step in this\ndirection has been taken only recently. You all know what it is the\nnationalisation of banks. I am fully conscious of the tremendous and\nspontaneous reception it has received from the people. A large number of\npeople— big and small— came to meet me, wrote to me and sent me\nmessages, to tell me that this was a right step in the right direction.\n      There still are many people for whom we have to do something.\nRicksha-wallas, tonga-wallas, stone-breakers— all these people come to\nme. These are the people who are undergoing the worst hardships in our\nbig cities. We have to enable these people to share this new light and to\ninfuse in them a new hope for a better and richer life. No single step can\nremove all their difficulties, but a beginning has to be made in improving\ntheir condition or in helping them to change their professions. We have also\nto solve the unemployment problem and to provide equal opportunities to\nall.\n      Our society, the Government, and the people, all of us have to unite\nand help these down-trodden people and to assure them a new life. We are\nforging ahead but sometimes suspicion and anger are created against the\nminorities, giving rise to violence. This also disturbs our unity which, in turn,\ndisturbs the peace in the country. We all know that if peace is disturbed our\nproduction cannot increase. Every section of the people has some\nproblems and difficulties and as we go ahead some new difficulties crop up\nand we have to face them. For this we want all our strength, and this\nstrength can be conserved and utilised only when we work together to\nsolve each other's problems and difficulties.\n       When banks were nationalised some rumours were set afloat that this\nstep was directed against a particular section of our society. I want to make\nit perfectly clear that we do not propose to do anything against anybody.\nWe want all of us to march forward together. But I want to assure the rich\nand the capitalists that the step that we have taken is not directed against\nthem. It is only in the interest of the people, and a measure which is in the\ninterest of the masses is in their interest also.\n      I am pained to learn that some voices have been raised against the\nstep that we have taken. It has been said that banks were nationalised at\nthe instance of some foreign power. I want to make it perfectly clear that\nwhatever steps we are taking are at the behest of the masse and in the\ninterest of our democracy. I know that the spirit of democracy is well\nentrenched in the hearts of the Indian people. I am also sure that they will\nnever do anything which may result in any harm to our country or which\nmay compromise our Independence.\n      When Mahatma Gandhi started the freedom movement, a great\nrevolution took place in our country. But he brought about this revolution\nwith great humility and with the co-operation of all. He emancipated the\ncountry from the clutches of a foreign power. The revolution that took place\nhas not ended yet, because in a fast changing world, our country and\nsociety have to keep changing constantly.\n       The path we have chosen is the right path. It is a path forged by our\nhistory and culture. But why is it that, in spite of the considerable progress\nwe have made, the minds of some people are still disturbed and there is\ndissatisfaction. Something seems to be lacking. Man wants something\nmore than progress and material advancement, and there comes a time in\nman's life when a revolution emerges from his heart, from the innermost\nrecesses of his being and when he can recognise his soul more deeply and\ncan view his surroundings more clearly. Such a time has come in the life of\nIndia today. There is a rush of fresh air caused by the sudden opening of a\ndoor. Those accustomed to living in a closed atmosphere are worried by\nthe blowing of this breeze; but there are many others who are tired of\nsuffocation and would welcome the new strength and life they receive from\nthis breeze.\n      Twenty-two years ago India awoke in freedom in the middle of the\nnight. My father declared on that memorable occasion that it was a tryst\nwith destiny. We have again reached a similar turning point and the future\nis unfolding before us; we have to adopt new paths to take our country\nrapidly ahead.\n      This is the year of the Gandhi Centenary. We have not only to keep\nthe programmes of Gandhiji fresh in our memory but also to remember the\nbasic ideals and principles of Gandhiji and to familiarise the new generation\nwith them. Another great man is to visit our country in the near future. All of\nyou must have heard the name of Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan. He was the\ngreatest disciple of Gandhiji. Our people called him the Frontier Gandhi and\nshowered upon him deep respect and affection. I have no doubt that when\nhe visits India we will welcome him with the same affection.\n      This is the age of science. This is also the age of the youth. They\nhave to follow new paths. They do not have to look towards anybody else,\nbecause those who look towards others for guidance are left behind. We\nhave to show a new path to our young people. I know that they are\nendowed with courage and determination. It is only by cultivating courage,\nhope, self-reliance and self-confidence that we can make progress and\ncarry our masses forward.\n       The tricolour we salute is a symbol of our democracy, of unity and\npeace, of development and progress of our country. We have to cultivate\nall these qualities in ourselves. It is our duty to preserve the honour of this\nwheel of peace which was given to us by the great Ashoka.\n      Standing before you here today, I can assure you that whatever I am\nand whatever work I do, the paramount thing is that I will always work in\nyour interest, in the interest of the masses. In this connection I want to give\nyou the talisman which Gandhiji gave us. He had said that if you are\nassailed by doubts while taking a step you should always think of the\nlowliest and the weakest of our countrymen. If an action is going to improve\nthe lot of the poorest and the weakest then it is the right action, and if you\nproceed on that path all your doubts will be removed. It is in this spirit that I\nwant to go ahead. We have made great progress but we have forgotten the\ncommon man. Wherever we go we find brave slogans and nobody cares to\nfind out how these slogans are going to benefit the poor and the needy.\n       Today we have taken a new turn. A new dawn has set in. I believe\nthat if the youth, the peasants and the labourers, whether they are in the\ncities or in rural areas, follow this new path, they will bring about a new\nwave of enthusiasm and produce a new spirit of sacrifice. We should\nalways think of the masses, of the poor people of the country. Only by\nraising them can we raise ourselves. If we have strength and if we have\ncompassion in our hearts, then alone can we realise the difficulties of\nothers and sympathise with others; then alone can we accomplish big tasks\ntogether. I have every reason to believe that the people of India will always\nstand together in unity.\n       Today, I give you all my good wishes. We have taken steps in a new\ndirection; new vistas have opened before us; and a cool and fresh breeze\nis blowing about our faces. No one need be afraid of this fresh breeze. All\nof us should march forward with courage. If we can do so, we can certainly\nachieve something big.\n       We have been a peaceful nation. At the same time we are aware that\npeace does not mean weakness, that peace is achieved by strength,\nself-reliance and self-confidence. I want every Indian cultivate these\nqualities. Mahatma Gandhi produced freedom-fighters out of a poor and\ndefenceless people. We can further strengthen that spirit, because today\nour people are more knowledgeable, more competent and more\ndetermined than in the past.\n      Many children are sitting in front of me. They are the citizens of\ntomorrow and we expect great things from them. We want them to have\nequal opportunities. We have to reduce the disparity between the high and\nthe low, between the rich and the poor, between one section of society and\nanother. We have also to reduce the gap between what we are and what\nwe want to become. Now let us raise the national slogan together.

But new India is only twenty-one years\nold. During these twenty-one years, we have faced many problems—\ndrought, floods, famine and shortages. At the same time, we have seen\nlarge development projects take shape before our eyes. These are our new\ntemples. In the midst of hopes and disappointments, we have continued to\nmarch forward.\n       Our people have faced innumerable difficulties with courage and\nfortitude. I congratulate them for the courage displayed by them in facing\nmultifarious problems. We owe our strength to the sacrifices and the hard\nwork of our great leaders.\n      On this day we take stock of the past and look at the future with hope.\nUndoubtedly, we are a great nation. But let us not forget that we have a\nlong road to traverse. I have no doubt that if we follow the path shown by\nour great leaders and hold fast to the principles laid down by them, we will\nbe able to achieve our goal without delay.\n       It is a matter of regret that in this land of the Buddha, Akbar and\nGandhi, there should be violence. It is inevitable that in a country of the\nsize of India there should be differences among various sections of the\npeople. These differences should be settled across the table. It is the duty\nof every citizen to assist in this process. We should help create conditions\nin which violence does not thrive; we should not allow riots to take place. A\nvast majority of our people are peace-loving. Why is it that a handful of\npeople are able to disturb peace? Harijans and people of other minority\ncommunities have sometimes suffered atrocities. Several lives have been\nlost. There has also been a loss of national resources. All this has\nweakened the nation’s strength. There has also been an attempt to create\ndifferences and doubts, which have the effect of undermining the\nconfidence of the people.\n      Let us resolve on this day that we shall give no quarter to such\ndeleterious tendencies. Undoubtedly, the Government has a duty to\nperform. But political parties, social organisations and the citizens of India\nhave also a responsibility to discharge. The reconstituted National\nIntegration Council has taken certain decisions which are being\nimplemented. I have every hope that we will succeed in creating a new\nclimate of peace and national integration in the country.\n     Peace is the foundation of our progress. During the last twenty-one\nyears, we have strengthened this foundation. We are beginning to stand on\nour own feet. After centuries of neglect, we are emerging; we are moving\ntowards self-reliance.\n      We have witnessed a revolution in agriculture. We have had a\nbumper crop. However, some parts are affected by drought, and some by\nfloods. Our hearts go out to those who have suffered as a result of drought\nand floods. We are making every effort to relieve their suffering.\n      Our bumper crop has been the result of a planned effort. Our kisans\n[farmers] have made good use of the agricultural inputs provided to them.\nHigher yields have not been the result of good rains alone. The revolution\nin agriculture will impart strength to our economy. Industry will also benefit.\n        The successes we have had should not blind us to certain problems.\nLet us not forget that agricultural inputs have been made use of only by\nfarmers who enjoyed irrigation facilities. A vast majority of kisans do not\nhave irrigation facilities and were, therefore, unable to make good use of\nagricultural inputs. This disparity between kisans possessing irrigation\nfacilities and those without irrigation facilities is growing. We have to ensure\nthat the ‘dry' farmers receive all possible assistant from us so that they can\nplay a useful role in stepping up agricultural production.\n       Our industrial progress is to some extent dependent on agriculture.\nImproved agricultural production has had a beneficial effect on our industry.\nI have every hope that we will continue to make progress in this field. Last\nyear I had said on this occasion that India would soon emerge from her\ndifficulties. The dark days are ending. We have not solved all our problems.\nBut if we continue to march forward with determination, we will be able to\nusher in a new era.\n       As we make progress, we are faced with the rising expectations of\npeople. Several sections of people and several unions have made certain\ndemands. Some of these demands are just and need to be met. We have,\nhowever, to realise that workers, teachers and office employees can voice\ntheir demands but a vast majority of people who are illiterate, unskilled and\nmuch poorer are unable to give expression to their demands. We cannot\nignore them. In taking a decision on the demands of organised sections of\nthe community, we have naturally to consider what effect the acceptance of\neven just demands will have on those whose demands are unrepresented.\nWe have also to weigh very carefully what overall effect the acceptance of\ndemands will have on the general economic condition. I, therefore, appeal\nto my brethren, be they workers, teachers or others, to view their demands\nin the national perspective. We are fully seized of their difficulties and we\nhave all sympathy for them. Let them compare their own difficulties with\nthose of other sections of the community.\n       When we talk of indiscipline among workers, I would like to say that\nindustrialists and moneyed businessmen cannot escape responsibility.\nThey cannot ensure discipline if they continue to make big profits and draw\nfat salaries. I would appeal to them to give thought to this problem and find\na solution. We should be able to reduce the disparity between the rich and\nthe poor. If we want our country to prosper, we should subordinate\npersonal gain to the national good. We should develop a spirit of sacrifice.\nOur aim should be more production. Every section of the community should\nrealise its responsibility to the nation. Then and then alone can we have\ndiscipline and devolution of responsibility. We should also develop a spirit\nof co-operation. We should not forget for a minute that our chief aim is to\neradicate poverty.\n       We have the problem of unemployment among engineers and other\neducated people. We are trying to solve this problem. We have to consider\nhow we can set up new industries and provide employment to a large\nnumber of people. I would appeal to the educated people not to hankers\nafter government jobs. They should try and create new opportunities for\nthemselves. There is ample scope for them in our developing economy.\nThey should develop a spirit of self-help and self-reliance.\n       We have invested hundreds of crores of rupees in our public sector\nprojects. This money does not belong to capitalists or industrialists. It is\npublic money. Profits made by public sector undertakings are spent on\npublic welfare—for building roads, schools, hospitals, etc. It is our duty to\nensure that public sector projects are run efficiently and successfully and\nyield profits. The entire Indian public is a partner in these enterprises.\nWorkers and managers employed in public undertakings have a special\nresponsibility. Public sector undertakings suffer from many deficiencies. We\ndo not want to hide these deficiencies. But it does not mean that all public\nsector undertakings are badly run. Some of them are being run very\nefficiently.\n      Our progress is dependent on national unity, on peace and on\neconomic and political stability. We have witnessed political changes in our\ncountry recently. The prophets of gloom in India and abroad predicted that\nour democracy would collapse. But the soundness of our democratic\nstructure has been fully vindicated. The Indian electorate is fully aware of\nits democratic rights and I have every hope that it will always exercise\nthese rights with discretion and for the national good.\n       Our actions produce repercussions in the international sphere. We\nare living in a fast-moving world. Each country is trying to cultivate and\nmaintain friendly relations with other countries. No nation severs relations\nwith another even if there are differences between the two. Even friendly\ncountries do not wish to be involved when there are disputes.\n      India has always followed a policy of non-alignment and of judging\nevery issue on its merits. Other countries are also taking to this policy. Old\nalignments are weakening.\n      The Soviet Union recently decided to sell arms to Pakistan. This\ndecision caused us concern. In our view it was an unfortunate decision. But\nwe should not be unduly perturbed. We should not present to the world the\npicture of a grumbling, discontented and scared nation. We are a strong\nnation. During the last two years, we have taken steps to make the nation\nstronger. Our troops are guarding our frontiers with courage. No matter\nwhat other countries say, we should have faith in our own strength. In the\npresent-day world, real strength is not military strength alone. We have to\nhave a sound industrial base and a united nation. We should not lose faith\nin our ability and capacity to defend ourselves.\n     Are we succumbing to pressures from any nation? I want to declare\ncategorically that India shall not succumb to any pressure. Men of strong\nconviction never succumb and we have a firm conviction and a strong\ndetermination.\n       We have had differences with Pakistan. Perhaps, these differences\nare due to the fact that we have had close relations. Sometimes brothers\ndevelop serious differences. aggression and of hostile propaganda. We\nhave been the victims of aggression and of hostile propaganda. In spite of\nthis, Pandit Nehru and Shri Lal Bahadur Shastri offered a No-War Pact to\nPakistan. On this day, I once again commend a No-War Pact for Pakistan’s\nconsideration. A No-War Pact will be of mutual advantage to both and will\nafford us an opportunity to face internal problems and to make progress.\n      Swami Vivekananda had said, \"Blessed are those who take birth in\nthis Great Land.” It is equally true that blessed is the nation where great\nmen are born. One such great man was Mahatma Gandhi. In October this\nyear, we begin the centenary celebrations of his birth. Gandhiji had\nenunciated some noble principles which are as valid today as they were\nduring his lifetime. These principles will have validity even in the future.\nGandhiji had dedicated his life to the service of Harijans, the poor and the\nbackward people. He sacrificed his life to maintain unity. We have to learn\na lesson from his teachings and the noble principles enunciated by him.\n       Naturally on this day we think of the youth of India. They are the\nbackbone of India. The strength of the nation depends on their strength.\nThere is ferment in the minds of the youth in India and elsewhere in the\nworld. There are many reasons for this ferment. Perhaps one reason is that\ntraditional methods cannot provide a solution to problems of the new age.\nWe can provide leadership to the youth only up to a point. From that point,\nthey have to carve out a new path for themselves and for the nation's\nfuture. They will have to face many difficulties and challenges. They have\neither to climb the mountain of difficulties or cut through it. There is no other\nway. Our hopes are pinned on the youth of India. They can impart strength\nto the nation in many fields. I have every hope that they will engage in the\nmighty endeavour of building a great nation. Their energy and their\nenthusiasm will be a source of inspiration and encouragement to the entire\nnation.\n       Brothers and sisters, the welfare of each one of us is indissolubly\nlinked with a prosperous India. We should forget our own difficulties and\nonly think of making India strong and prosperous. We should face unitedly\nthe many problems facing us. No matter where we are— in the plains, in\nthe hills, on the borders or the sea-coast— we are all citizens of this great\ncountry. We should not do anything, wittingly or unwittingly, which will lower\nthe prestige of the country. We should so conduct ourselves that the future\ngenerations remember us for laying the foundation of a strong nation for\nushering in a new era.\n      I congratulate you all on the occasion of the twenty-first anniversary\nof India. I congratulate the kisans who, through their hard work, have\nsolved the food problem to some extent. I congratulate the industrial\nworkers for their effort in increasing production. congratulate all others who\nhave faced difficulties with courage.\n    I call upon the people to join hands in making this ancient land a\nmodern, powerful and prosperous nation.\n       Gandhiji's selfless service has left an imprint on history. He will be\nremembered for all times to come. We should draw inspiration from his\nteachings and his noble principles and make an effort translate his dream\ninto reality.\n    On this day, as I speak to you from the ramparts of Red Fort two\nnames that are associated with Red Fort come to mind. Netaji Subhas\nChandra Bose had exhorted the ‘Indian National Army' to march to the Red\nFort. He had also given us the 'Jai Hind' slogan. Pandit Nehru carried this\nslogan to every nook and corner of India. Today this slogan has become a\nsymbol of our unity and strength. Jai Hind."},{"year":1967,"pm":"Indira Gandhi","party":"INC","title":"Towards a Better Life","footnote":"Free translation of speech in Hindi from the ramparts of Red Fort, Delhi, Independence Day, August 15, 1967","source":"The years of challenge: Selected speeches of Indira Gandhi, January 1966-August 1969","text":"For the second successive year, I have unfurled the National Flag on\nRed Fort. You will recall that last year we were drenched in rain on this\noccasion and there were earth tremors. The tremors were said to be a\nwarning of coming difficulties. While on this day last year we stood in rain,\nthere was a severe drought in many parts of the country. The people were\nfaced with immense difficulties. Today, at this time, there is no rain here,\nbut India is having an excellent monsoon. Let us hope that we have the\nrequired rainfall and the country will new turn. Let us hope there will be no\nmore drought and food shortages. Let us hope that we will begin a new life.\n       The people in the drought-affected areas have faced innumerable\ndifficulties with great courage and fortitude. This is not surprising. Our\npeople have always been known to overcome difficulties. Our people have\ngone through difficult times in the past; they have faced many aggressions.\n      Why has the Red Fort been chosen for this ceremony? Because it is\nin Delhi, which is the door-step of India. The banner of freedom was raised\nhere on many occasions. When the last battle of freedom was fought and\nthe country was partitioned and there were riots, the message of unity and\nindependence went out from here.\n       The people of India have survived many crises. Today, there is a\nfeeling of despondency in the country. Only a few days ago; we observed\nthe 25th anniversary of the Quit India movement. Twenty-five years ago\nthere was gloom in the world. The world was in the midst of World War II.\nAt that time, Gandhiji gave us the ‘do or die’ message to achieve\ndeliverance from foreign rule. There was not a ray of hope of India\nbecoming free. But in a short period of five years our dream came true.\nFrom this we have to learn the lesson that gloom is not perpetual. The\ndarkness will end soon and the dawn is near. We will soon overcome our\ndifficulties. We need courage and determination to do so.\n       Much has happened during the last twenty years. Perhaps we could\nhave achieved much more. Nevertheless, our achievements are many. A\nnew generation has been born. It is not aware that India lived in slavery. It\nis not aware of our freedom struggle. It is not aware that the poor and\nhungry masses of India fought the mighty battle of freedom and won.\n      Some voices are raised that there has been no improvement in the lot\nof the Indian people. Publicity is given to it in India and abroad. But if we\nlook around we will find that, while milk, sugar and other articles of daily\nnecessity were cheaper in the past, there avenues of progress for the\npeople. There were few facilities for the education of children. The living\nconditions of farmers and other rural folk were not satisfactory. Their\nchildren did not attend school. They did not own bicycles. The spirit of\nenterprise was lacking. We have definitely made progress during the last\ntwenty years. Maybe the pace of progress has not been fast enough, but it\nhas been continuous.\n       Rural folk are aware of the difficulty of having to wade or swim across\nswollen rivers and rivulets during the monsoon. The current flows most\nswiftly in midstream and it is there too that the water is deepest. India is in\na somewhat similar situation. We are in midstream. I have no doubt that,\ngiven courage and determination, the people of India will be able to cross\nthe deep waters and reach the other bank. We cannot afford to look back;\nwe cannot afford to wait even for a single second. We must continue our\nprogress. We must cross the swollen river. Once across, our progress will\nbe easier.\n       Violence has no place in India. We must fight communalism, linguism\nand casteism if we have to make speedier progress. Regionalism also\nposes a danger. One can understand the desire of every State to make\nprogress but no individual or State can make progress in isolation. We\nmust keep the picture of a united India before us all the time. We have\nfaced many challenges and many difficulties in the past. We have always\novercome them. Today we are faced with food shortages not in one State\nbut in many parts of the country. Food shortages have created a new\nproblem and new doubts in our minds. We may recall that when India\nbecame free, we were assailed with doubts whether we would be able to\nform a stable Government and maintain the unity of the country. After the\npartition of the country, there was aggression on Kashmir. Later Gandhiji\nwas assassinated. Our great leaders left us one by one. However, side by\nside, the people of India gained strength. The vast mass of people living in\nevery part of India are the nation's real strength.\n     We have undoubtedly made progress in the economic sphere. We\nhave set up new industries. We have increased agricultural production. We\nhave to maintain the rate of progress in the agricultural and industrial fields.\n      We have made every effort to reach food-grains to deficit areas. You\nare aware that West Bengal, Kerala, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and many other\nparts of the country are faced with food shortages. Through the efforts of\nthe Government and non-official organisations, the needs of the people\nwere met to some extent. I would like to congratulate the people of these\nStates for the courage with which they faced difficulties. They have upheld\nthe honour of India. They have shown that a free nation is capable of\novercoming difficulties.\n       The people of India are faced with many other problems. There is the\nproblem of rising prices. There is a demand for higher wages. This problem\nis not confined to India. The whole world is faced with the problem of rising\nprices and the demand for higher wages. It is a vicious circle of rising\nprices, higher rents, higher wages and again higher prices. It is our\nendeavour to break this vicious circle. We want to stabilise prices. We have\nall to co-operate to solve this problem. We have to make sacrifices. We\nshould restrict our purchases of consumer goods. It is not an easy problem.\nThe poorer sections of the community are the worst sufferers. I have the\ngreatest sympathy for them. We have to find ways and means of solving\nthis problem.\n      I know that everyone wants an increase in his wages. People are also\nworried that they can buy very little even with increased wages. We have to\nfind a solution to the problem of people's needs. We have limited\nresources. We have to consider ways and means of augmenting our\nresources. If we can increase our resources by suffering hardship, we\nshould not hesitate to do so. Then our difficulties will end soon.\n      Our Constitution envisages the formation of Governments by different\nparties in different States. Today we have Governments of different\ncomplexions. They have freedom to follow their own paths. It has always\nbeen our endeavour to extend the fullest co-operation to them. Sometimes,\nperhaps in anger, or perhaps because of their helplessness in the face of\ndifficulties, the States accuse us of discriminatory treatment. The charge of\ndiscrimination is absolutely baseless. India is one nation. We treat all\ncitizens equally. All States are equal in our eyes. It is our endeavour to\nensure equitable distribution of food and other resources. We want to\nremove the difficulties of all. Bu as our resources are limited, we can only\nshare what we have. I do hope that the people will appreciate our difficulty\nand co-operate with us.\n       We have taken up many projects for the development of the country.\nWe have spread education. Progress in such fields as women’s welfare,\ndevelopment of communications and brought many changes. We have\nopened up new vistas of progress. But as we progress in new fields, new\ndifficulties arise. All sections of the community are faced with difficulties.\nUnrest is a world phenomenon, whether it is among students or other\nsections. There are problems of race, language or other similar problems\nfacing various countries. We should not magnify our difficulties.\n      Two years ago, our leaders put forward a proposal that education up\nto the university level should be in the mother tongue so that the benefits of\neducation could reach everyone and the talents of the people could find a\nnatural outlet. Can we achieve this ? Even a good proposal sometimes\ncontains the seeds of danger. It is feared that this proposal might\nencourage separatism. This proposal could prove beneficial if there is a link\nlanguage which can bind the people together and thus help maintain\nnational unity. Similarly, there is need to maintain links with the world. We\ncannot afford to live in isolation in the present-day world. It will prove\nharmful to our interests. Therefore, there should be three languages— the\nregional language, a national link-language and an international language.\nWe have to keep in view the difficulties of the people in the matter of\nlanguage. We have to consider how the difficulties of the people in various\nparts of the country can be minimised and how they can be helped in every\npossible way. No one should have the feeling that something is being thrust\non him or that impediments are being put in his path.\n       Sometimes we think that a particular view is beneficial to the people\nat large. But there are people holding other views. In this matter we have to\ncarry the people with us. We cannot ignore the views of others. We have to\nfind a solution which is acceptable to all, and which does not weaken our\ndemocratic structure or our national unity. The question of language\ngenerates emotion and anger. If a proper solution is found, language can\nbecome a force for national unity and national progress.\n      Regional tendencies have been on the increase. The people of each\nState think that if development schemes are implemented in that particular\nState, India will make rapid progress. Unfortunately, our resources are\nlimited. We have to determine an order of priorities for different\ndevelopment schemes. We must look upon all States as our own. There is\nno need to feel upset if a development scheme is implemented in another\nState. We should be patient. Gradually, all development schemes will be\nimplemented. We should draw inspiration from our past when we overcame\ninnumerable difficulties.\n      We need peace for our progress. We want peace at home and\nabroad. We stand for world peace. There are tensions sometimes. All kinds\nof questions arise. There are tensions even in a family, between brothers\nand sisters. We have always stood for a peaceful solution of all questions.\nIt has always been and continues to be our endeavour that all questions\nshould be solved through peaceful means. But if there is aggression on our\nborders, we will meet it with all our might. A few days ago, I visited some\nforward areas. Our officers and Jawans are guarding our borders with\ncourage. They are not deterred by adverse weather conditions. I have seen\nthem guard the snowy mountains. I assured them that the entire nation was\nbehind them. I conveyed to them the good wishes of the Government and\npeople of India. I have full confidence that the honour of India is safe in the\nhands of our Armed Forces. Let us not forget that we have a responsibility\ntoo. Our officers and Jawans are bearing hardship and are prepared to\nsacrifice their lives to protect the territorial integrity of India. We should also\nbe ready to bear hardship and make sacrifices. We should keep in view our\nobjectives.\n      What is socialism ? There are differing definitions. A simple definition\nof socialism is that poverty should be eradicated; disparities between the\nrich and the poor should be reduced; the backward people- be they\nHarijans, adivasis or the hill people— should have equal opportunities to\nmake progress; and there should be equal distribution of national\nresources. This is our socialism and this is our goal. We want to achieve\nthis goal rapidly.\n       Sons and daughters of India— be you workers or kisans [farmers],\nbusinessmen or industrialists, teachers or students, writers or artists— you\nare all inhabitants of this great country. You should not forget this for a\nmoment. Through your veins runs the blood of heroes, and great men. Let\ndiffidence give way to confidence; let despair give way to hope. We will\nthen be able to build a strong nation; we will then be able to raise the\nstructure of a beautiful Bharat. We are capable of doing so. We have\nembarked on an exciting venture. We shall face every difficulty— be it war\nor famine— with courage and determination. We shall not let the nation go\nunder.\n      My countrymen, join me with all your heart in raising the national\nslogan. Let this slogan echo all over. Let it be a symbol of our national\nstrength. Let it guide us towards national progress.

Our Independence is one such event. Independence Day\nhas special significance for us because on this day we began a new life.\nOn this day, nineteen years ago, the first Prime Minister of India,\nJawaharlal Nehru, unfurled the national flag from the ramparts of Red Fort.\nOn this day, he lit the torch of freedom and laid the foundation of\nIndependent India.\n       On this day, our minds turn to our great leaders and to innumerable\npeople from all parts of the country who flung themselves into the freedom\nstruggle and made immense sacrifices. They were truly great men. We owe\nour freedom to their courage, forbearance and sacrifice. The responsibility\nof following the path shown by these great sons of India has devolved on\nus.\n        Standing here on the ramparts of Red Fort, my mind inevitably turns\nto India's past—a past studded with achievements in the fields of science\nand philosophy and in other fields. India was an advanced nation and had\nprovided leadership to the world. How can we forget India's glorious past?\nIt is for us to see that our record remains unblemished.\n      On this occasion, we naturally think of the Father of the Nation.\nJawaharlal Nehru had once described Mahatma Gandhi as a magician.\nDespite his belief in science and the new world, Jawaharlal Nehru felt that\nthe path shown by Mahatma Gandhi was the right path. Nonviolence', 'truth'\nand swadeshi summed up Gandhiji's message. It is my firm belief that this\nmessage still holds good.\n      Non-violence means that we should live in peace and amity, and\nentertain respect for one another's views. It also means that we should\nentertain respect for nations professing different ideologies.\n      Similarly, we want truth to pervade all our actions. Fearlessness is an\nessential part of truth. We should be as fearless today as we were during\nthe struggle for freedom. We should not be afraid of making mistakes. We\nshould not be afraid of making changes. We should be willing to adopt new\npaths and to imbibe new ideas. It is very necessary for us to have a\ncomplete understanding of the problems facing us. Only then can we find\nthe way out.\n      Swadeshi is the third part of Gandhiji's message. The country is faced\nwith economic difficulties. We can improve the economic situation by\nimbibing the spirit of swadeshi. Swadeshi does not mean that we do not\nimport at all. It only means that we should exercise the utmost economy,\npatronise our own goods and make full use of available resources. If,\nhowever, it becomes necessary to import with a view to learning new\ntechniques, we should not hesitate to do so. The responsibility for\npopularising the swadeshi movement does not rest with the Government\nalone. Every citizen, be he a villager or a town-dweller, has to play an\nimportant part in popularising it.\n      We have accepted the socialist path because we feel that there is no\nother way of eradicating poverty. Democracy is the base of our socialism.\nDemocracy confers many rights on the individual. These rights have\ncorresponding duties. Our greatest duty is to help the nation achieve\nprogress. We have launched many development programmes. The\npurpose of these programmes is the removal of poverty. We have to wage\na relentless war against poverty. I appeal to my countrymen to join in this\nbattle.\n      The peasantry is the most important wing of our society. Peasants\nare the predominant section of our population. I appeal to them to adopt\nmodern techniques of agricultural production. I also need their\nCo-operation in bringing about reforms in rural life.\n       The role of labour is equally important. A great responsibility rests on\ntheir shoulders to increase production for defence and for other purposes.\nBy increasing production, they will improve their own living standards and\nalso help the nation in its march towards progress.\n      Our brave Jawans [soldiers] are guarding our frontiers. Our hearts go\nout to them. Let us remember that our defences lie not on the Himalayas\nbut in every village, every town and every city. The peasant, the labourer,\nthe industrialist, the businessman, the team and the employee have all an\nequally great responsibility in this task. Each one of them should discharge\nthis responsibility faithfully.\n      Artists, writers and thinkers, too, have a responsibility. This is to show\nthe nation the right path. They should not hesitate to imbibe new ideas from\nabroad. They should also see that our own ideas flow to other countries.\n       We have to continue our march towards progress. There can be no\nlet-up. Many sections of our society have suffered from neglect for\ncenturies. There are the Harijans, the adivasis [tribal people], the hill people\nand the minorities. We pay special attention to them. We have drawn up\nprogrammes for their welfare. But much more remains to be done. I am\nfully aware of their difficulties. Some of them suffered hardship during the\nrecent drought. Without their uplift, the nation cannot make much progress.\nI appeal for their co-operation in the tasks facing the nation.\n       Then, there are the women of India, belonging to all sections of\nsociety and engaged in multifarious tasks. They carry the responsibility of\nrunning the home, of bringing up the new generation and of braving the\ndifficulties arising from spiralling prices. Women constitute 50 per cent of\nthe country's population. For centuries, they have imparted strength to the\nnation. For centuries, they have upheld the noble traditions of India. We\nlook to them again to maintain the high traditions of our culture. They\ncontinue to be the source of the nation's strength. We look to them for\ninspiration.\n     Innumerable people participated in the struggle for freedom. Many of\nthem are not in our midst today. On this day, we pay our homage to them.\nSome of our freedom fighters are old. We are benefiting by their\nexperience.\n       A new generation of Indians is coming up. They were not witness to\nthe freedom struggle. They are not aware of the fervour which impelled us\nto fight for freedom. The responsibility for the nation’s progress and\ndevelopment falls on them as much as it falls on those who were\nassociated with the struggle for freedom.\n       We are faced with threats on our borders. We are also faced with the\nthreat of poverty and backwardness inside the country. We cannot fight the\nbattle against poverty successfully unless we accept new ideas, unless we\ndo away with superstition, unless we work with dedication and\ndetermination to attain progress, unless we are prepared to make sacrifices\nin the face of difficulties. It is the duty of every individual to lend his\nco-operation in this great task. No one can absolve himself of this\nresponsibility. We cannot remain idle spectators. We are all soldiers in the\nfight against poverty.\n      At the time of aggression on our borders, our young men, our\nstudents, offered to lay down their lives to defend the country's territorial\nintegrity. They were ready to write with their blood a new chapter in the\nhistory of India. The nation beckons to them again. They should be ready to\ntake up the challenge. They have to infuse new life into the nation. They\nhave to regenerate the nation.\n       We are assembled at the historic Red Fort today. The eyes of the\nentire nation are focused on us. We have the panorama of Indian history\nbehind us and we have the vision of a bright future ahead. Every citizen\nshould ask himself what he can contribute to the making of a bright future\nfor the country. He should ask himself whether the nation's policies and\nprogrammes can be successfully implemented. On the answer to this\nquestion depends our progress. If the people are assailed by doubts and\nhesitation, difficulties will naturally arise. But if they are resolute in\naccepting the challenge, the nation can face both external and internal\ndangers and march towards progress. It is not an easy task; we never had\nany illusions about it. We may have made mistakes. We may not have\nmoved with speed. But many of our difficulties are the result of the process\nof change and development itself. If we had remained static, our difficulties\nmay not have increased, but we would have remained a poor and\nbackward nation. We have deliberately chosen the more difficult path of\nchange and progress.\n      Let us recapture the fervour which characterised our freedom\nstruggle, and work with dedication for a new revolution which will energise\nthe whole nation and inspire us to answer the call of our motherland. I have\nabsolutely no doubt that we have it in us to achieve great things. But if we\nstray from the right path, we will be heading towards ruin, and the sacrifices\nof the great sons of India would have been in vain. Let us draw inspiration\nfrom those who fought for freedom and kept the nation's flag flying.\n       We extend our hand to all friendly nations. Our sympathies are with\nthe victims of colonialism. We will continue to raise our voice against\ninjustice and war everywhere. We want the subject peoples, the victims of\noppression everywhere in the world, to breathe the air of freedom and to\nhave full opportunities for progress.\n       I take a pledge on this day to work for the nation's uplift and to fight\ninjustice everywhere. If we march unitedly as disciplined soldiers along the\npath shown by Gandhiji and Jawaharlal Nehru, we can make India a great\nnation. Let us all take this pledge.\n       I call upon you to join me in raising the great slogan given us by\nNetaji Subhas Chandra Bose. This slogan represents our strength. Join me\nin raising the slogan three times. Your voice is the voice of a great nation. It\nshould reach the far-off mountains and every nook and corner of India. It\nshould inspire courage and self-confidence in every Indian. Jai Hind, Jai\nHind, Jai Hind."},{"year":1965,"pm":"L.B.

We had made it clear that unless Pakistan\nwithdrew from Kutch completely, there would be no talks. This has been\nachieved. Pakistan has withdrawn from Kutch. She has no troops, no police\nand no posts in Kutch. India has complete civil control over the territory. An\nAgreement to this effect was signed. India accepted the Agreement as she\nwas not in favour of disturbance of peace in any part of the world.\n       Even while we were negotiating about the implementation of this\nagreement. Pakistan invaded Kashmir. I use the word invasion deliberately.\nIt is absurd to say that civilian raiders have infiltrated into Kashmir from the\nPakistan-occupied Kashmir. Pakistan must bear full responsibility for the\nattack. Pakistan had banked upon an internal revolt in the wake of that\nattack. Pakistan intends to step up trouble in Kashmir.

If\nthere are disturbances in the country, how can we defend our borders with\nsingle-minded devotion? We should eschew communalism and casteism.\n      What is happening in Kashmir might not end in a matter of days. It is\nnot as if the raiders would withdraw in a day or two. It is difficult to say how\nlong this threat would last. Pakistan intended to annex Kashmir by force\nand it is likely that she would make it a prestige issue. We have our\nnational self-respect too; we have certain responsibilities to discharge. I\nwant to state categorically that Pakistan will not be allowed to take even an\ninch of our territory in Kashmir.\n       I am confident that every Indian will heed my appeal for unity and\npeace. We have to defend our borders and defeat the designs of those who\ncast an evil eye on us. The honour of the flag under which we stand today\nhas to be upheld. We may perish, but we will not allow the honour of our\nflag to be sullied. India will continue to progress and prosper."},{"year":1964,"pm":"L.B.

It was our brave leader,\nJawaharlalji, who inspired this idea. We can never forget him. He was one\nof the greatest leaders of the freedom struggle; and after winning\nIndependence he launched the massive task of India's reconstruction. For\nseventeen years he worked unceasingly, day and night, to consolidate our\nfreedom.\n       We all remember the joy and enthusiasm which surged through the\ncountry on August, 15, 1947, when we regained our long-lost freedom. For\nseventeen years, you witnessed every year the unforgettable scene of\nPandit Jawaharlal Nehru standing at this spot and unfurling the national\nflag. We cannot forget the dignity and courage with which he led the\ncountry. He became a part of our life. Now he is no longer with us. His\ninspiring voice is mute but he has left us an invaluable heritage which we\nmust preserve. We have to surmount the difficulties that face us and work\nsteadfastly for the happiness and prosperity of our country.\n       The food problem has become very acute during the last month and a\nhalf. The States of U.P., Bihar, Bengal, Maharashtra, Gujarat and a part of\nRajasthan are facing food scarcity. I can assure you that we are doing our\nbest to meet this situation. We have rushed foodgrains from surplus States\nlike Punjab, Orissa, Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh and also from\nimported stocks. Though we are not yet out of the woods, there has been a\nperceptible improvement. We will have to intensify our efforts during the\ncoming months. We will also have to limit our consumption and help to feed\nthose of our countrymen who are less fortunate than ourselves. We should\nnot store foodgrains in excess of our requirements. I am confident that we\nwill face this problem with courage and far-sightedness. We will have to\nstop lavish feasts during the coming two or three months. Ministers will not\nparticipate in feasts and will not hold any parties. This may not result in\nmuch saving of foodgrains but it will have a psychological effect and set a\ngood example before the people.\n       The basic question to which we have to address ourselves is that of\nincreasing the production of foodgrains. I do not want to go into the details\nof the steps we are going to take. Broadly, we want to assure a fair price to\nthe producers and procure grain without causing hardship. I am sure we\nwill be able to improve our position considerably within a year or two.\n       I do not want to minimise the other problems that face us. The prices\nof everyday necessities like cloth, oil, sugar and matches have risen. This\nhas naturally affected the farmer also. During the last 15 years we have\ninvested Rs. 20,000 crores in our development plans. Unless this huge\ninvestment results in a corresponding increase in production, it is bound to\nlead to inflation and high prices. We will have to devise steps to arrest\nrising prices. There is no question of going back on our objective of\nestablishing a new revolutionary society but we will have to take firm action\nto control prices. I am confident that the Government will be able to find a\nway out of the present economic difficulties.\n      I want to ensure that essential commodities are available at fair prices\nduring the coming years. I am not very much concerned about the prices of\nluxury goods but I do want the common man to be able to get food, cloth\nand articles of everyday use at a fair price. Every shop will have to display\na price-list and Government officials will have to enforce it strictly.\n       We want peace at home and abroad. We have to pay particular\nattention to our relations with our neighbours. The Chinese invaded our\ncountry. Their attitude has not changed. Therefore we cannot change our\nattitude either. In consonance with the principles laid down by Gandhiji and\nJawaharlalji we are always prepared to hold talks, consistent with our\ndignity and self-respect; but our country is not going to bow down to any\nthreat of force or of an atomic bomb. We are confident of the\nstrength of our people, and are capable of facing every danger. I am happy\nthat President Ayub Khan has expressed friendly sentiments for India. I\nwelcome his plea for amity between India and Pakistan. We also desire\namity. Border incidents are not good either for Pakistan or for India. It also\ndoes not redound to our credit that we are not able to stop the migration of\nlakhs of people from across the border. I hope that we shall be able to hold\ntalks within the next few months and create an atmosphere of goodwill\nwhich may lead to a settlement.\n       We have friendly relations with our neighbours—Burma, Ceylon,\nNepal and Afghanistan. Some problems do crop up sometimes. I am happy\nthat the Prime Minister of Ceylon has accepted our invitation to come here\nduring October. I am confident that we will be able to find a solution to the\nproblem of the people of Indian origin in Ceylon. Our Foreign Minister,\nSardar Swaran Singh, is going to Burma, and I hope he will be able to\nresolve the present difficulties with that country.\n       Jawaharlalji showed us the path of peace. We will work for world\npeace with all our strength. We will steer clear of alignment with power\nblocs and pursue an independent policy. We adhere to the policy of\nnon-alignment, co-existence, disarmament, anti-colonialism and\nanti-racialism. We are firmly opposed to colonialism and we want to see the\nend of Portuguese colonialism. We cannot tolerate racial policies, whether\nin South Africa or elsewhere. We stand for truth and justice, not in an\naggressive manner but with dignity and restraint.\n      We can win respect in the world only if we are strong internally and\ncan banish poverty and unemployment from our country. Above all we\nneed national unity. Communal, provincial and linguistic conflicts weaken\nthe country. Therefore, we have to forge national unity. I appeal to all to\nwork for national unity and usher in a social revolution to make our country\nstrong.\n      In the ultimate analysis, the strength of the country does not lie in\nmaterial wealth alone. A country is made strong by people like Gandhi,\nJawaharlal and Tagore; by the force of character and moral strength.\nTherefore, I appeal to our young men to inculcate in themselves discipline\nand character and work for the unity and advancement of the nation. If our\nyoung men and women work in this spirit, I have no doubt that the future of\nour country will be bright."},{"year":1963,"pm":"Jawaharlal Nehru","party":"INC","title":"The Sixteenth Year","footnote":"English rendering of the Independence Day address, delivered in Hindi, Delhi, August 15, 1963","source":"Jawaharlal Nehru, Selected Speeches, Volume 5 (1963-1964)","text":"We are again assembled here today on this auspicious occasion of\nthe sixteenth anniversary of free India. Sixteen years ago today, we met\nhere, below the Red Fort, and our National Flag fluttered here for the first\ntime. We shall never forget that day when India attained freedom after a\nlong and hard struggle and great suffering. We were kind of intoxicated with\nhappiness and celebrated the day with fervour. We thought our days of toil\nwere over and we would be able to build our country. But, very soon, the\ncountry was overtaken by a terrible calamity. In the wake of the partition of\nthe country, there were riots in Pakistan and on this side of the border.\nThese were ghastly events which shocked us and pained us. But we faced\nthe situation and gradually brought it under control. Then came the\nassassination of Mahatmaji at the hands of an Indian. We could not have\nsuffered a more rigorous sentence. Nevertheless, we asked ourselves what\nGandhiji would have wanted us to do—would he want us to mourn and\nbewail or fight those evil forces and ideologies which could destroy the\ncountry. We faced them and triumphed over those forces.\n        A fresh wind began to blow again across the country and we decided\nto devote all our energies to build a new and prosperous India so that the\npeople could move forward and strengthen the nation. Big plans were\nprepared which we have been implementing for the last 10 or 12 years. I\nbelieve, and I think you will agree with me, that the face of India has\nchanged in these 10 or 12 years and is still changing. New cities have been\nbuilt, thousands of new factories have been set up. Projects have been\nimplemented and everywhere a measure of prosperity is discernible. No\ndoubt, we are still very far from our goal. But these achievements cannot\nbe denied. In recent years, our attention has, however, strayed from the\nfundamentals. We became complacent and felt that our freedom was\nsecure and there was none who could threaten it. We had not yet grasped\nthat freedom is not secure by itself. We did not realize that freedom calls for\neternal vigilance, year in and year out, day in and day out. In the absence\nof vigilance, dangers arise. We had become standard-bearers of peace in\nthe world and India was rightly regarded as a country which stood for\npeace. We still stand for peace. But weakness goes ill together with peace.\nPeace can be secured by strength and endeavour, not by complacency.\nThat way alone can peace be secure in the world and our voice can be\nheard with respect.\n       All of a sudden, aggression was committed on our borders last year\nby a country which we had looked upon as a friend. This naturally shocked\nus and we had to pass through hardships and difficulties. This also had its\ngood consequences, because we were shaken out of our complacency and\nonce again a climate of preparedness and sacrifice was generated. I still\nremember how our people, the ordinary people, offered to the nation all\ntheir possessions, cash, gold and silver. Those who had the least gave the\nmost. People forgot their mutual conflicts, put them aside and realized that\ntheir first duty was to face the danger to the freedom of the country. The\nspirit of unity manifested itself in the country, which proved that\nnotwithstanding the apparent differences, there is an underlying unity which\ncomes to surface at the right time.\n       Our morale was high. We strove to prepare for defence and to raise\nour strength, and the country did become strong. But popular enthusiasm is\nnot enough preparedness. Preparing for the defence of the country means\na thousand different activities to make the equipment and material which\nthe defence forces need. Backing this all, are the countless farms of India\nwhich produce foodgrains and other foodstuff. Preparedness therefore\nmeans all-round effort, everyone in this place striving hard to produce to\nthe limit of his capacity so that our economy is strengthened. We have\nattended to these matters and some progress has been made and is still\ncontinuing.\n       But again the state of complacency is returning because the\nhostilities have ended. In place of the unity and harmony that were\nwitnessed, the old controversies and conflicts which weaken the country\nhave reappeared. Unfortunately, this is our old failing, reasserting itself\nwhen we are not face to face with danger. But we are facing continuous\ndanger on our borders and it becomes our first task to defend the country\nagainst it. Other things can wait. Who will respect that country which cannot\ndefend its independence and its territorial integrity? Such a nation is even\npowerless to make any progress. No doubt, at this moment the biggest task\nfacing us is to raise the strength of the country, increase production and\nbanish poverty so that everyone has an equal opportunity for progress, and\nthe millions of our people and our children have a chance to lead a better\nlife and to get the good things of life. But all this presupposes that we\nuphold our honour and make our freedom secure. Any slackening in this\nrespect will leave the country disheartened, weak, powerless. A free\ncountry which wants to maintain its freedom gives top priority to its\ndefences. Everything else comes afterwards. On this question there can be\nno argument, although there is scope for discussion. We have to speak\nwith one voice. The unity of India, which is most vital to us, comes first—the\nunity which manifested itself last year and early this year but which we\nhave been neglecting after the fighting stopped. It is unfortunate that again\nconflicting and dissenting voices have begun to be heard and small and big\ncontroversies have erupted.\n        Ours is a free country and everyone has a right to free discussion and\ncriticism which one can freely exercise. But with rights go duties and\nobligations. Anyone who neglects his duties cannot protect his rights. The\nnational duty today is to defend the country, to maintain unity and increase\nthe nation's strength, irrespective of religion or State. Everybody has his\nrights but if we neglect this duty we weaken our claim to those rights. There\nare several rights which cannot be fully operated today. All our citizens are\nentitled to a happy life, to be freed of the burden of poverty and to expect\nopportunities of progress for their children. We are marching towards that\ngoal and we that the day will come when it will be achieved. The fact,\nhowever, remains that we are far from that goal and we can reach it only\nwhen we fulfil our duties.\n       When I say that the country is facing dangers on the borders, I am\nnot suggesting that something is about to happen. Rather that this new\nsituation that has arisen has created new dangers on our borders, which\nwe appear to have forgotten. Of course, we have to station our troops and\nour Air Force to guard against this menace, but the Army or the Air Force\nalone cannot protect the country. Nowadays, the defence of the country\nrequires all the people, men and women, to do something or the other in\nthat cause. The defences have to be strengthened by the endeavour of the\nentire nation, by its unity and ability to work together, in farms and factories\nor wherever we happen to be. We should all prepare ourselves to meet the\ndanger so that we could strengthen our country and thus strengthen the\nArmy.\n       It is a strange world in which we live, a world which is changing. On\nthe one hand, there is a danger of a world war in which nuclear weapons\nmay be used. On the other hand, there are also some favourable trends.\nRecently a treaty was concluded in Moscow on nuclear tests by the United\nStates, the Soviet Union and Britain. We and other countries acceded to\nthe treaty later. The agreement does not eliminate the danger of war but it\nshows a way to bring war and warlike tendencies under control and to\nensure peace in the world. Seven or eight years ago, we had made this\nproposal in the United Nations, which it has now given the shape of a treaty\nin Moscow. We were the first to raise our voice for this kind of arrangement.\nWe are, therefore, particularly happy that our proposal has been acted\nupon and hope that a move having been initiated, further progress will\ncontinue to be made and the world would be rid of the nuclear danger.\nYoung men and women today face a life full of dangers as well as hopes. It\nis a good thing that we live in such times because in a situation like this a\nnation can become strong and courageous. Soft living is not good for any\nnation because it weakens the people. I wish to congratulate the people,\nparticularly the young men and women and the children, that they live in an\nage full of tests and trials more difficult than the examinations they have to\ntake in schools and colleges. The tests in life are harder and bigger and no\nbook can help us in facing them. To face these tests and trials and to\nemerge victorious, we need character, a stout heart and mind. As the years\nroll by and free India grows up, we have to grow in strength along with it\nand never permit ourselves to become complacent. We may have two,\nthree or even a thousand different views, but so far as the unity of India and\nits security and prosperity are concerned, we have to speak with one voice.\nThere is no scope for difference of opinion in this matter. We can argue\nabout the approaches and methods, but whenever we take any action we\nshould ask ourselves whether by that step we are serving India,\nstrengthening its unity, helping in the defence of the country or weakening\nit. This should be our yardstick in whatever we do because often we are\ncarried away in the heat of factional controversies and weaken the country.\nWe should remember all this because the days to come will not be easy\nones. However we look at the situation, we are going to face a difficult time.\n      After the attack on our borders, we were compelled to take certain\nmeasures which we did not like. The military expenditure had to be\nincreased, more than double, and for has to go on for ever. Recently, when\naggression was that taxes had to be levied and increased. Nobody likes\ntaxes, neither the taxpayer nor the government. But when the country is in\ndanger, those who are talking about their profits and not about the danger\nhardly serve the country. Money we can earn and spend, but the country\ncommitted, everywhere, whether in our Parliament or in the country at\nlarge, we rose to the occasion and despite the hardships, we faced it with\nfirmness and dignity. No matter how much we have to suffer, even at the\ncost of our lives, we have to face the danger of aggression so that India\nmay live.\n      Now, we have to face all kinds of dangers, internal and external, and\nin so doing if we have to carry heavier burdens we should be prepared to\ndo so. When nations go to war, the people have to carry tremendous\nburdens and sometimes a country is laid waste. We are not facing such a\nwar at the moment. Nobody knows what the future holds for us. But to avert\nsuch a war we have to be ever vigilant and we have to undergo hardships.\n      We have a reputation for being a peace-loving people. The fact that\nwe are expanding our defence capacity and giving military training to our\nyoung men does not mean that we have given up our principles and policy\nof peace. We shall follow that policy in any situation and try to resolve\ndisputes with other countries by peaceful means, if it is possible to do so.\nWe do not like war which can bring ruin to the country and cause hardships\nto the people. But there could be no peace without honour, certainly not by\nsubmission to evil, out of fear. If the people are seized by fear, they weaken\nthe country and tarnish its fair name. Thus. while we prepare with all our\nstrength for the defence of the country, we shall tread the path of peace.\nWhenever we can solve any problem in the world, any issue concerning us,\nwe shall always resort to a peaceful course, but not to the detriment of\nIndia's honour. To uphold that honour we shall prepare in full measure. This\npreparedness does not merely mean arms and armaments. It means that\nevery man, woman and child in the country has to offer something, has to\nbe ready to work with determination and in co-operation with others. Very\nfew people in our country know how to march in step. Marching in step is\nnot in itself a virtue but it stands for working together. An army is strong\nbecause the soldiers work together, march in step. They are disciplined\nand follow rules. We have to teach to our countrymen discipline, the\noutlook of a soldier.\n       It would be a good thing for our future if we prepare ourselves in this\nmanner and when we are out of the present danger, we would be a strong\ncountry with courage and confidence in ourselves. Then we would be able\nto march and the road to prosperity with ease. Nations become great by\nself-confidence, not by relying on others. You can be friends with others,\nbut you have to rely on yourselves. There can be co-operation with others,\nbut you have to do your own thinking and work with your own hands. Any\ncountry which forgets this and is frightened and loses self-confidence\nbegins to decline, faces ruin and lowers itself. What greater indignity can\nthere be for India than that fear should grip us and we lose confidence in\nourselves? Whatever work is there, it is we who have to do it, although we\nhave friends in the world and we have to maintain that friendship and take\ntheir help. The big countries in the world have helped us and we are\ngrateful for that, not only for the help but for their sympathy. We have to\nmarch ahead towards our goal on the path we have chosen for ourselves,\nand we shall attain that goal. We have to remember this principle and\nensure the progress of the country. Relying on ourselves and with the help\nof friends, we have to solve our economic problems, and so change our\ncountry that it would be able to stand on its legs.\n       I particularly want that the millions of our children have an opportunity\nfor growth, for education and to serve the country and to serve themselves.\nLet us build an India in which these opportunities are available and there\nare no differences of high and low. This is our vision of India. Of course, the\nPlanning Commission and other offices of Government are working for this\npurpose, but as you know the Government and the Planning Commission\ncan only show the way. The work has to be done by millions of our people.\nIf they cannot do it, neither the Planning Commission nor the Government\ncan achieve anything. Whether it is defence or development, it is the\npeople who have to carry out the work, not those sitting in offices. Our task\nis to awaken the 450 million people of India and to show the path. It is for\nthem to march along that road and reap the benefit. Whatever happened\non our border this year was, I think, all to the good because it will\nstrengthen and fortify us. It would prepare the country for progress,\nprovided we do not lose heart. Our people have never trodden the path of\ncowardice.\n      I again congratulate you on the 16th anniversary of our freedom and\nhope that you will remember the day. Free India is still a child, for what are\nsixteen years in the life of a country ? Of course, ours is an ancient country.\nI hope it makes progress, becomes strong and holds its head high in the\nworld. Let us remember these things, particularly the fact that we are all\nbrethren in this country; wherever we live, and whatever our religion, we\nhave to work together. Whoever forgets this fact does not serve the country\nwell."},{"year":1962,"pm":"Jawaharlal Nehru","party":"INC"},{"year":1961,"pm":"Jawaharlal Nehru","party":"INC","title":"Independence Day Address","footnote":"Speech, 15 August 1961, in Delhi, at the Red Fort, NMML, AIR Tapes, TS No. 7146, NM No. 1460.","source":"Selected works of Jawaharlal Nehru. Second Series. Vol 70, (1 July - 20 August 1961)","text":"Sisters, brothers and children, it is the fourteenth anniversary of\nindependent India. I congratulate everyone on this auspicious day. On this\nday ideas and memories come crowding into the mind. First of all, there is\nthe memory of Gandhiji who led us towards freedom. We must not only\nthink of him but of the lesson that he taught us and the path shown by him.\nIf we stay away from that path, we will come to grief as we have done in the\npast. Let us think of him and the millions of martyrs who toiled for India's\nfreedom, bore untold hardships and in some instances, gave up their lives.\n      Then we must look back over the fourteen years which have gone by\nand take stock of our achievements and failures, our progress and the\nthings that need to be done. We must look to the past because we learn\nfrom our experience. But ultimately our sight should be on the future\nbecause it is the millions of Indians who are responsible for moulding that\nfuture. It is not fate, for it is we ourselves who make or mar our fate by our\nactions. Therefore, we must think of the future. The people of India have\ncome a long way and overcome great obstacles. But the future is full of\nmore obstacles and the goals that we have set our eyes on are far away.\nYet the years gone by give us confidence and strength for we have crossed\nmany milestones. Each of the Five Year Plans has been a great step and\nnow we are about to start the Third Plan. We hope that by the end of the\nThird Plan India would have progressed a great deal and become stronger\nand more prosperous. It is the foremost duty of every nation to protect its\nfreedom. Unfortunately danger threatens on our borders and so we must\nbe constantly vigilant.\n       Only yesterday, a small incident occurred and a small piece of Indian\nterritory consisting of a few villages which had been separated from India\nfor a long time, have once again been merged into India. They are Dadra\nand Nagar Haveli. It is a small piece of territory and yet the smallest piece\nof India's territory is dear to our hearts and so we are extremely happy that\nit has come back to us. It also reminded us of the other small pieces of\nterritory here and there which need to be merged into India once again.\n      It is not our policy, and nor do we wish to launch an attack on any\nother country or capture their territory. These are outdated notions. We\nhave no desire to attack anyone or to interfere in their affairs, nor will we\ntolerate an attack on our country. Gone are the days of territorial conquest\nand empire building. This is a new age in which territorial integrity and\nsovereignty of nations is sacred. This is the age of cooperation between\nnations. Those who violate these principles do not belong in this age.\n        You must try to understand the age in which we are living today.\nAeroplanes have become very common today. Man is trying to reach the\nMoon and the stars. At a time like this, how can we barricade ourselves\nbehind our narrow frontiers and indulge in petty squabbles? We are on the\nthreshold of a new frontier, a new age and must prepare ourselves to fit\ninto it. On the one hand many of our young men are already prepared and\nare trying to participate in the task of building a new world. This is\nsomething for us to be proud of. But on this day particularly, I do not wish to\nboast about our achievements in the last fourteen years of which we can\njustifiably be proud. It would be better to focus our attention on our\nweaknesses.\n      You may have read our Vice-President's message which has been\npublished in the newspapers. He has laid special emphasis on the need for\ndiscipline. Our armed forces are extremely disciplined, courageous and\ninspire confidence. But there must be discipline among the millions in the\ncountry because we have to foster the fundamental unity of India which\ncreates an unbreakable bond in spite of the tremendous diversities of\nlanguage, province, religion, etc., and India's myriad forms. We must\nremember that we are one large family and any man or woman who does\nsomething which hurts that unity or weakens us does harm to India. We\nmust respect our neighbour and his religion and cooperate with everyone in\nthe country. The sad thing is that we often forget this lesson and fight\namong ourselves in the name of religion, province, caste, language and\nwhat not. There can be arguments and debates among the people. But\nanything which creates disunity and bitterness and barriers is bad, for it\nposes obstacles in the path we are trying to follow. You must remember\nthat we have taken up a gigantic task of uplifting crores of human beings,\nwhich has perhaps no comparison anywhere in the world. We are trying to\ngo from one age into another, from the old rut and way of living and mire of\npoverty into a new and prosperous age. Prosperity and progress bring\nother things in their wake which uplift the mind and the spirit. Love of ease\nand comfort can take a country nowhere.\n       People in India have had to face tremendous hardships in the last\nfourteen years. We have progressed and there has been some relief. There\nare problems and they will continue to be there and in one sense, we are\nlucky to have them because a nation which faces no problems and\ndifficulties becomes ease-loving and soft just as the children of rich parents\nbecome useless and weak. We do not need such weak people. We want a\nstrong and spirited nation in which there is unity and a bond of affection. If\nyou look at the India of today, you will see a strange picture. Big things are\nhappening all over the country and India is holding her head high once\nmore. Millions of children go to schools and colleges and learn about the\nnew world. They are preparing themselves to serve India and the world in\nthe future. At the same time, there is bitterness and hatred, quarrels over\nsmall things, etc.\n       Our attention is focused at the moment on the Punjab where the\npeople are courageous and have served India well in the past and during\nthe freedom struggle and will undoubtedly do so in the future too. But\nunfortunately along with their bravery and courage, which have made them\nfamous soldiers, there is great bitterness and internal feud among them in\nwhich their energies are frittered away. Similar things are happening in\nother parts of the country too. Therefore though one of our major problems\nis to implement the Five Year Plan and march in step, the most urgent\nproblem confronting us today in India is to create unity, a spiritual bond, an\nemotional integration among the people. Recently, we had a conference of\npeople from the different states to deliberate over this matter and certain\ndecisions were taken. But that was only a step. This is something which we\nmust give first priority. All our progress and industrialisation and prosperity\nwill be useless if we fight among ourselves and are unable to cooperate\nwith one another. This is of fundamental importance. Therefore I feel sad\nwhen such incidents occur in the country and people are perturbed about\nthe trends in the Punjab, I hope that the people will be sensible and nothing\nuntoward will happen. The people of the Punjab are emotional and\nhotheaded but ultimately capable of understanding. So they will\nundoubtedly be sensible and soon the mental fog which envelops us and\nprevents us from seeing clearly will be removed and fresh air and light will\nprevail in which the present problem will be solved. No problem can be\nsolved by violence and fighting or hunger strike. These are not democratic\nmethods of solving problems, for they create barriers among the people\nand social chaos will result. We must build a structure of society which is\npurely Indian and not a Hindu society or a Muslim, Sikh or some other\ncommunal society.\n       Therefore our urgent priority is one of mutual cooperation. There are\nmany religions in the country, some of which came originally from outside.\nBut we must respect all of them for they belong to India and have done so\nfor thousands of years. India has been famous down the ages for her\nreligious tolerance and respect for other ways of life. Emperor Ashoka has\nhad this message engraved on stone more than two thousand years ago.\nWe have slid back from that and fight among ourselves in the name of\nlanguage, religion, caste and what not. The caste system cannot exist in a\ndemocracy. We must get rid of it for it has divided our society in the past.\nEveryone should be welcome to follow his own religion but that does not\nmean that there should be religious feuds which weaken the country. We\nmust remember that the greatest dharma in India is unity, cooperation and\ntolerance and anything which comes in the way of that is wrong, no matter\nwhat name it goes by. Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Christians and people of all\nother religions belong to India and enjoy equal rights. They must march\nforward together. How is that to be achieved if we squabble among\nourselves?\n     As I told you, this is the age when man looks to the Moon and the\nstars and soon he will reach them. Those who risk their lives for the country\ncontribute to its greatness. A country cannot progress by sitting still. Money\nis certainly important but it is human beings who make money and not the\nother way round. We need human beings and humanism in the country.\n       Secondly, you will notice that there are constant reverberations of war\ndrums in the world and preparations for war. More and more lethal\nweapons are being discovered which can destroy the whole world once\nthey are unleashed. In spite of that, the elder statesmen of the world do not\nhave the wisdom to put an end to this mad race for armaments. It is quite\nobvious that the modern lethal weapons cannot solve the problems of the\nworld—they can only bring destruction and ruin upon it. There is no\nquestion of winning or losing in such a war, for the world will become one\nlarge graveyard. Anyhow, we must first try to manage our own affairs. What\nshould be our course of action when the world faces such grave dangers?\nIt is obvious that we should continue to follow our own path and try to throw\nour weight on the side of peace. But how can we hope to have an impact\nunless we create an atmosphere of peace in our own country? We vitiate\nthe atmosphere by internal squabbles and disunity. How then can we serve\nthe world? Therefore, it is my request to you and through you, to the people\nof India, that you should understand the age in which we live and the India\nthat we are trying to build. India is trying to cross new frontiers and old\nweaknesses have no place in that. The important thing is the attitude of the\npeople of India and whether they are in a mental rut or get out of it and try\nonce again to climb new heights of humanism. This is the real problem\nwhich confronts India today. The Five Year Plan and other projects are part\nof this. You must try to understand what we have to do. Nobody can make\nus do anything if we are engrossed in our petty squabbles or election fever\nand what not. Elections come and go but a nation goes on and so do its\nprinciples. If a nation fails to remain on the rails, winning elections can\nsolve nothing. What we face today is victory or defeat of an entire nation.\nThat is why I request all of you, the people of India and particularly the\npeople of the Punjab, Sikhs as well as the Hindus, to look at this question\nfrom this angle and not in a narrow minded, emotional way. Please\nremember that wrong means can make even the right goals wrong.\n       Gandhiji taught us this lesson that wrong means do not lead to the\nright goals. Therefore I hope that in this historic age of ours the history of\nIndia and the world will be written by the actions and hard work of the\npeople as it was done during the freedom struggle. The historians will put it\ndown later. At a time like this, we cannot allow petty issues to lead us\nastray and forget the larger, more important things. No problem can be\nsolved by bitterness or feuds. This is my request. Let the people of India\neschew this path and look to the new shining world before us and take the\ncountry towards it.\n       More than fifty years ago, your elders dreamt of India's freedom\nwhich came true. It is seldom that one's dreams come true in one's own\nlifetime. But in that one moment, we realized that we still had a long way to\ngo. We needed to foster unity in this great land of ours stretching from the\nHimalayas to Kanyakumari, and to make her people broadminded and\nlarge-hearted and prosperous once more. It is no small task to try to uplift\nforty-three crores of human beings and to get rid of the weaknesses and\nbarriers of the past. We want everyone to have equal opportunities. So long\nas we cherish all our religions, we will progress but communalism is bad\nbecause it creates disunity. We must get rid of anything which keeps us\napart. I would like to tell you that one good yardstick for measuring any\naction of ours is to see whether it binds us together or keeps us asunder.\nChildren and grown-ups must understand that the most urgent priority\nbefore us today is discipline of the minds and hearts, and anything that\nmilitates against it, no matter what garb it dons, is wrong. Please remember\nthat.\n      There are innumerable children sitting here. They are the future of\nIndia for whom we are working today. We have to build a beautiful new\nworld for them and instil into them a sense of India's past greatness and\nalso the need to grasp the new scientific and technological advance which\noccurred in the world. We must get rid of the weaknesses which create\nbarriers among us and live as one great family.\n      I give you my greetings on this auspicious, fourteenth anniversary of\nIndia's independence. I would like to draw your attention to the fact that our\nPresident has not been very well for the last few days and all of us hope\nthat he will become well soon and continue to serve the country as he has\ndone throughout his life. Jai Hind! Please say Jai Hind with me thrice.\n      Jai Hind! Jai Hind! Jai Hind!"},{"year":1960,"pm":"Jawaharlal Nehru","party":"INC","title":"In New Delhi: Independence Day Speech","footnote":"Speech at the Red Fort, 15 August 1960. AIR Tapes, NMML.","source":"Selected works of Jawaharlal Nehru. Second Series. Vol 62, (1 August - 31 August 1960)","text":"Sisters, Brothers, Compatriots, yesterday you celebrated\nJanmashtami. Today we are gathered here to celebrate the anniversary of\nIndia's freedom. Thirteen years ago, this beloved flag of ours fluttered from\nthe ramparts of the Red Fort for the first time, heralding to the world the\nbirth of a new nation, of a new star in the firmament. We had celebrated the\noccasion with great pomp and show, but in reality it was a day not so much\nof rejoicing as of recalling old memories and a renewal of the pledges taken\nand promises made in the past. Many of those pledges had been fulfilled\nbut many more remained, and we were confronted with new problems and\nchallenges. Therefore it was essential to march forward once again with\nheads held high and a heart full of determination. We had reached one\ndestination. But our voyage was by no means over, and we went on, facing\nall kinds of ups and downs, stumbling occasionally, falling, but gaining\nstrength once again from the memory of our beloved leader, Gandhiji and\nthe principles that he had taught us.\n       So, we are gathered here today, not to witness some spectacle but to\nrecall the past, and to look to the future. We are here to reaffirm the old\npledges. It is true that we got freedom through incessant toil, sacrifice and\ntears. But if you think that our work is over with the coming of freedom, you\nare mistaken. The fight for freedom is never ending. We have to toil\nincessantly and make sacrifices to hold on to it. The moment a nation\nbegins to relax, or becomes complacent or weak and fritters away its\nenergies in petty quarrels, its freedom begins to slip away. So as I told you\njust now, today is not a day of some grand spectacle. It is a day to reaffirm\nand renew our old pledges and promises, and to examine our hearts a little\nto see whether we have fulfilled our duties or not. What is the first and\nforemost duty before a nation or a people? Its first duty is to maintain its\nfreedom, because if you give it a second place, everything else slips away\ntoo. Therefore everything must be measured by this yardstick. Anything we\ndo must be judged from the point of view of whether it helps us to maintain\nour freedom and unity and contributes to the country's progress or not. If\nany of us forgets this and gives greater importance to one's province or\ncommunity, caste or language, we will be ruined and take the country with\nus on the path of ruin. All these things are good in their own place, the city,\nstreet, province, family, etc. But if we attach greater importance to any of\nthem and place them above the country, we will undoubtedly fall. I am\nreminding you of this because the time has come to do so, and we often\ntend to forget these things. We tend to forget the hard work, sacrifice and\ntoil of fifty years, during which we or rather the people of India, under\nGandhiji's leadership, moulded the country into a strong nation and welded\nit into a peaceful weapon to win freedom. Freedom was a certainty once\nthe country became strong and united and developed the capacity to work\nhard, because please remember that the enemy is within us. Nothing can\nharm us if our hearts are in the right place and we are capable of working in\nmutual cooperation and without fear. India has never had to fear anyone\nfrom outside. She has had to fear the internal weakness and disunity and\nthe fissiparous tendencies, which have broken the country into a thousand\nlittle fragments in the past. We were conquered again and again by outside\nforces, not because they were stronger but because of our own weakness\nand stupidity. This weakness and stupidity rear their heads now and again\nwhen people quarrel among themselves in the name of language or\nsomething else, forgetting that the thing that matters is the unity of the\ncountry. The moment we forget it, we cause great harm to the country, no\nmatter what we may profess. This is something that should be borne in\nmind and not merely that, but I would say that the time has come for every\nIndian to search his heart to find out if his loyalties are towards the country\nor some narrow parochial interest. The answer has to be found by every\nsingle man, woman and child. The time has now come where there is no\nlonger any room for a mistake or misconception. If we indulge in petty\nsquabbles and internal wranglings, without realising what is happening in\nthe world today, the new lethal weapons that are being invented, the\ndanger that threaten our borders and the fact that the world is divided into\ntwo armed camps, nobody knows when disaster may strike, we will invite\ncertain ruin.\n       What will be the verdict of history if we forget our unity? The verdict\nwill be that there came a great leader - Mahatma Gandhi to India, who\ntaught the downtrodden, hungry and naked population of the country the\nlessons of freedom, unity and the need to break down the barriers between\nhuman beings. He worked for the uplift of the downtrodden Harijans and\ntaught the people the lesson of equality, irrespective of caste and religion.\nThen freedom came. Was it meant only for a handful of people? Was it for\na Jawaharlal, who has been made the Prime Minister? Jawaharlal may\ncome and go, and so will others, but India will remain forever. Therefore,\nevery single human being in India, man and woman, child, is the heir to\nIndia's freedom and must enjoy the full benefits of that freedom. It is\ntowards this that we continue to toil ceaselessly and do planning and what\nnot. We want every one of India's forty crores of people to get an equal\nshare in the country's freedom and so we have adopted a socialistic pattern\nof society as our goal.\n        It is a difficult task and cannot be done immediately. There are\nthousands of pitfalls, difficulties and problems in the way. You cannot\nchange a human being or a nation of forty crores overnight. But ultimately\nthe kind of society that we want will emerge if we keep our eyes constantly\non our goal, on socialistic principles and equality of rights and opportunities\nto all, whether they live in towns or villages. We need to work hard to\nincrease the wealth the country and then ensure the equitable distribution\nof that wealth, so that it does not remain in a few pockets. There is no\nmagic in this that we can get it by counting beads. We will have to work\nhard and achieve our goal by blood, sweat and toil.\n      The historians will record that there came a time when the whole of\nIndia woke up to life suddenly and became vibrant from the Himalayas to\nKanyakumari, began to hold their heads high and shed the burden of\nhundreds of years of bondage. They marched fearlessly under the\nleadership of their beloved Gandhiji towards freedom. After hundreds of\nyears, India shone once again and the world heard her voice, which had a\nprofound impact, because it was the true inner voice of the nation. India\nbegan to be respected once again. But very soon, the same people of India\nwho had shown such great courage seemed to revert to their old\nweaknesses and began to fight among themselves in the name of religion\nor caste, language and province. The world began to wonder if it had made\na mistake in judging this nation.\n       Today is a day of remembrance, of recalling the past, of introspection\nand renewing our pledges. If some people refuse to celebrate this day\nbecause they are grieved about something, they may be justified. But it\nshows that they are forgetting the larger issues in denying the importance\nof this day and are forgetting what India stands for. Everything else in the\nworld loses its importance; language, province, personal grief and\nhappiness, before it. This is how we must look at these things.\n       You must be aware of the great tragedy that has befallen Assam and\nBengal. Two of our great provinces are facing great problems. We will\ncertainly solve them. There is no doubt about it. But what I cannot tolerate\nis that the people, in their bitterness and fear, do not allow things to cool\ndown. There is constant criticism. Please remember that of all the\nweaknesses in the world, fear is the worst. There is nothing worse than\nfear, because all other weaknesses and evils in this world spring from it.\nOnce an individual or a nation gives in to fear, gradually all other evils will\novertake them. Telling lies, deceit, are all the offspring of fear. India\nbecame strong because Gandhiji rooted out fear from our hearts. He taught\nus to be fearless in the face of great imperial might, and the lesson of unity.\nWhy is it then that the people of Assam and Bengal, who have always lived\nthere, should suddenly be afraid of one another? Why is it that they are\nforgetting India, which is larger than both Bengal and Assam and those\nwho do so, can serve neither Bengal nor Assam? Those who can forget,\neven on this day, where their loyalty lies and what their duty is, are being\ntraitors to their country. All of you must understand this and determine\nfirmly to get rid of such weaknesses from the country.\n      Take the Punjab, which lies close to Delhi. A few days ago a strange\nuproar took place there, in the name of language and province, etc. This is\nnot the occasion to go into the merits of the case. But I know that the\nevents that took place in the Punjab, and the way things were done were\nabsolutely wrong, bad and completely against the spirit of India's freedom.\nPunjabi is a grand tongue, a strong and powerful language, and I feel that\nevery Punjabi has the right and a duty to learn it. If he fails to do so, he will\nlose a great heritage of his. It is part of the national heritage. I cannot\nunderstand why there should be any arguments about Hindi, Punjabi,\nBengali or Assamese. All of them are valuable treasures and part of India's\nculture. It is only small, narrow-minded, illiterate, useless minds that set up\none language against the other. Sensible human beings learn as many as\nthey can.\n      Where are we going? What are these pettiness and misconceptions\nwe are falling into? India is a great country with a long and glorious past\nand a history going back thousands of years. There is good as well as bad\nin our country. A new era has started in the history of India and the people\nare once again strong and vibrant as a nation. How can we serve the\ncountry by indulging once again in petty feuds and by fighting in the name\nof caste, language, religion and province? Language and religion are things\nwhich uplift a human being. How can we use them to inflict such deep\nwounds on our body politic? Please think about all this.\n      India has become free and we have no desire to commit aggression\nagainst any other country. Those days are gone. But at the same time, we\nshall not tolerate any enemy to come into our country. There has to be\ncertain reciprocity in these things, of mutual respect between nations. If any\ncountry behaves in a way injurious to our dignity, we will combat it in every\npossible way. If danger threatens our borders, we will face it. We do not\nwant even an inch of anyone's territory, nor do we wish to interfere in the\nrights of others, because our principle is that the freedom and territorial\nintegrity of all nations is inviolate. It is our principle that every single village\nshould have autonomy and govern itself through its panchayat.\n       There is one small gap in India's freedom. People may think that we\ndo not remember. But it is something that always rankles in our minds and\nwill continue to do so until a small part of India, called Goa, becomes free.\nLet the world not forget that this is always in the minds and hearts, and it is\nonly by great willpower and courage, not weakness, that we have\nprevented ourselves from solving the problem by armed intervention. But\nIndia cannot forget Goa and the problem will be solved. I want the world to\ntake note of this, as also the power which has Goa in its clutches. Let there\nbe no mistake about this.\n        I would like you to look at the world of today. Just when we were\nhoping that the atmosphere was improving, things have taken a turn for the\nworse and once again there is poison and bitterness among the nations.\nThe big powers are once again indulging in sabre-rattling. All sorts of lethal,\nterrible weapons have been invented. In such a dangerous, terrible world,\nthose who make the slightest error of judgement or become disunited are\nbound to fall and become weak. We must remember this, especially on this\nday and pay homage to the memory of that great man, Gandhiji, who has\ncontributed the most to making India strong and united and led her to\nfreedom. It is not enough to pay homage. We must remember and act upon\nhis principles. India is no small country which can veer this way or that. The\nonly two courses open are India's destiny and either to hold our heads high\nand march forward in the world, or downfall, if we are weak. There can be\nno middling status for us. It is obvious that we cannot allow our country to\nfall, for gone are those days. We simply cannot tolerate it. Therefore the\nonly course open to us is to hold our heads high and march in step, in unity\nand cooperation. There is no other alternative before us and if anything\ncomes in the way of this, it will have to be removed because we cannot\nallow petty things to stand in the way of India's destiny.\n       However, this is not in my hands. You have made me the Prime\nMinister for a few days, so I am here. There are innumerable defects in me.\nThe real strength of India lies in her people, in you, and you, and the\nmillions of others who live in India. It is you who must understand what\nIndia's destiny is, especially on this day, and decide where your duty lies.\nHow are we to utilize this invaluable freedom of ours to uplift India's\nmillions? How are we to prevent freedom from slipping away due to our\nweakness? What I am saying is not limited to a handful of officials or\nministers or even prime ministers. This is up to the millions of people in\nIndia, in every single village and town in the country. We want panchayati\nraj in the country. Every single panch and sarpanch must be strong and\nindependent and capable of protecting the interests of his village. This has\nto be done all over the country. I want to remind you of this because it is\nyour duty towards the country. We have served the nation for a few years\nand sometimes made mistakes, but we did our best with honesty and\nintegrity. But the tasks that we have taken up cannot be completed by the\nlist of men without the help of the people. Take the five year plans, for\ninstance. It is not something which has been laid down. It is the picture of\nthe future of India, which can be realized only by hard work and by bearing\ntremendous hardships. India will then undoubtedly progress, but your\nunderstanding and effort are absolutely essential. At a time like this, how\ncan we not indict those who foment trouble and incite the people, as\nwrongdoers and the guilty party? Please think about it.\n      Finally, I shall once again repeat what the foremost duty of every\nIndian is. His first and foremost duty is to maintain and strengthen India's\nfreedom and her unity. This is the lesson that we have to learn on this day.\nMy greetings to all of you on the anniversary of India's freedom and\ncongratulations for this day, thirteen years ago, when the flag of freedom\nwas unfurled for the first time. I hope there will be hundreds and thousands\nof such anniversaries. Jai Hind.\n      Please say Jai Hind with me thrice before we sing the national\nanthem. Jai Hind! Jai Hind! Jai Hind! Say it aloud Jai Hind! Jai Hind! Jai\nHind! Jai Hind! Jai Hind!

On this day, we\nlook back a little at our achievements in the past and to the future as well\non this day. Twelve years is a very short period in India's history of\nthousands of years. The soil and stones of Delhi have seen thousands of\nyears go by as well as the last twelve years when the people of India have\nbeen trying to take their country out of the old rut of poverty and the\nhardships that afflicted it. This is a far more difficult task than even the\nstruggle for freedom because it involves getting rid of our weaknesses and\nthe burdens of the past under which we have been groaning for centuries.\nWhat we have been able to achieve in the last twelve years is there for\neveryone to see. A number of good things have happened and some bad\ntoo. Many things have happened which I think will find a place in the history\nof India in the future. At the same time, other things have happened which\nhave weakened us and exposed our shortcomings.\n      So all of us are assembled here near the Red Fort and the tri-colour\nhas been unfurled once again. What are the thoughts in your minds about\nthe future? We have had to face innumerable difficulties in the last twelve\nyears both internal and external. There have been great national disasters,\nfloods and droughts and failure of crops, etc., and our weaknesses have\ndogged our footsteps relentlessly. Many people in the country have gone\nastray in their greed and forgotten the interests of the nation in their own\nnarrow selfish interests, forgotten the great tasks that we are engaged in to\nbuild a great nation once again and caused great harm to their country in\nthe hope of some immediate benefit to themselves. Even today you are\nfacing great difficulties, inflation and other things and to some extent, we\nare helpless and unable to bring the matter fully under control. It is partly a\nresult of man's narrow self-interest. Well, whatever it is, it will have to be\nfaced. On this day especially we must remember what we are and what we\nwish to become and where we are going. We must refresh our memories\nonce again about the events of twelve years ago when our beloved leader\nMahatma Gandhi was still with us and we looked to him for guidance. We\nhad been looking to him for guidance for years and years and tried to follow\nthe path shown by him and achieved success by doing so. How much do\nwe remember of those days? We cannot afford to forget at any time that\nthe most important task before us is to establish unity in the country\nbecause if we break up into separate parts, whether on the basis of\nlanguage, province, religion or caste, we will lose all our strength and fall.\nWe cannot progress and instead of a bright and shining future, India's\nhistory will be one of small communities fighting among themselves.\n        Therefore the first thing to remember is unity. We must break down\nthe innumerable barriers, old and new, among us and always put the\ncountry first before a part of it, no matter how good that part may be. If a\npart of India has any greatness, it lies in the fact that it is part of India.\nWithout that, the various parts of the country will have no greatness or\nimportance. So we must remember this because we have become so used\nto living in small little compartments in the past due to the caste system that\nthe habit has not gone fully yet. We must get rid of it and conquer it.\n       Secondly, what are our goals for the future? There are social and\neconomic goals before us and we wish to remove poverty from India. All\nthis is true. But what is the yard-stick for measuring these things? One\nyard-stick shown by Mahatma Gandhi was to see how far the common man\nin India benefitted. We do not have to bother about the handful of rich men\nfor they can look after themselves. It is the common people who are often\nsilent about their hardships especially the people who live in the rural\nareas, who need to be looked after. Please remember that though Delhi is\na very special city of India and the world, and all of us who are the citizens\nof Delhi are extremely fortunate in a sense, Delhi is not India. India consists\nof millions of villages and until they progress, India cannot progress even if\nthe cities of Delhi, Bombay, Calcutta or Madras advance. Therefore we\nmust always keep the picture of India's villages in mind and devise ways\nand means for their progress. We can all help but ultimately they will\nprogress only by their own effort, daring and self-reliance. The biggest\ndisaster that has occurred in the country today is that our people are\nforgetting how to be self-reliant and expect others to do their work for them.\nOur villagers are strong people, good people. But they have got into the\nhabit of looking to government officials to do things for them, instead of\nstanding on their own feet. The plans are aimed at making them self-reliant.\nIf the community projects and national extension schemes work well, it will\nbe a revolutionary thing for India and the world for it will be a reawakening\nof five and a half lakh villages of India. If the government officials run these\nthings it will be no revolution it will be an ordinary, lifeless affair. Life has to\nflow from within a nation and cannot be put into it artificially.\n       Therefore it has become a big challenge to this country to the people\nliving in cities as well as villages, to learn to stand on their own feet and\nwork in mutual cooperation. The government must certainly help in every\nway. But a nation cannot progress by the efforts of government servants\nalone. It has to learn to stand on its own feet. This is true specially of the\nvillages. Therefore we have decided that there should be cooperative\nsocieties to make the people strong and teach them to work together and\ntrust one another that does not mean that the government should interfere\nconstantly. I want that government interference should be as little as\npossible and the people must learn to hold the reins of government in their\nown hands. The fundamental policies may be decided by the government.\n       Now another thing to be kept in mind is the yard stick that is to be\nused to measure India's progress. The only yard-stick is the progress of the\nforty crores of Indians. How does a nation progress? It can be only through\nits own effort. How can you make a poor country prosperous? Again, it can\nbe done only through the effort of the people. No nation can progress by\ndepending on the charity of others. So we can progress only by our own\neffort and by increasing the production of wealth in the country. How have\nthe countries in the West advanced? Whether it is Europe or the United\nStates, they have become wealthy by their own effort. Behind the wealth\nand progress of each one of them lies tremendous hard work and unity. No\nnation can progress without these two things.\n      The habit of working hard has not developed in our country. It is not\nour fault. We have got into such habits due to circumstances. But it is a fact\nthat we cannot work as hard as people in Europe, Japan, China, the Soviet\nUnion or the United States. Please do not think that those nations have\nbecome prosperous by magic. It is only by their hard work and intelligence\nthat they have advanced so far. So we can also progress by working hard\nand using our intelligence. There is no other way. We cannot progress by\nmagic. The whole world moves by the effort of human beings. The wealth\nof the entire world is produced by the hard work of human beings, whether\nthey work on land or industries or shops or at some handicrafts. A handful\nof officers sitting in their offices do not produce any wealth. It is the farmer\nor the artisan who produces wealth by his work.\n      I was happy to see that recently the Punjab Government have\nincreased their working hours. The wealth of the Punjab will definitely\nincrease and the people will benefit. There are so many holidays in this\ncountry that nobody can compete with us in this matter. Holidays are good\nthings and refresh a man. But too many holidays are not good because the\npeople get out of the habit of working.\n       So, as you know, we are on the threshold of the Third Five Year Plan.\nTwo Plans are over and we have benefitted greatly from them. The more\nwe have progressed, our problems have increased proportionately. We are\nhemmed in by problems from all sides and sometimes the burden has\nseemed great. But we have progressed and all these problems are a sign\nof that progress. Those who do not move need face no problems nor find\nany answers. Even today when we are surrounded by problems and\ndifficulties, they are the problems of a growing nation, a nation which is\nprogressing from very strong foundations. Huge steel plants and other\nprojects are coming up. What do they stand for? They are not merely\nindustries but a symbol of the new life that they will provide in various\ncorners of India. The big industries that are coming up will form the\nfoundation of our progress. They will provide employment to millions of\npeople who will produce new wealth. So in this way, the Five Year Plans\nare not merely putting up plants and industries but are building the edifice\nof an independent and prosperous India. It is essential to lay the\nfoundations well. We cannot see the foundations though the two Five Year\nPlans have done so. Now we are on the threshold of the Third Plan for\nwhich we are preparing from now. I want you to understand it because\neven the Third Plan is not going to usher in an era of leisure and rest. We\nwill have to work hard to complete it. No nation can progress without\nworking hard and bearing some hardships. Those who do not learn to face\ndifficulties become slack and listless and the nation slows down.\n      So there is a great challenge before us and the eyes of the world are\nupon us. They want to see what a great country like India which has\nproduced even in these times a man like Mahatma Gandhi does now. It is\nnot only a question of putting up industries, increasing food production,\nexpanding community projects, etc. The main thing is how we go about\nthese things and whether it is with our heads held high or following the\nwrong path. We must remember this because the most important lesson\nthat Gandhiji taught us was to hold our heads high, not to adopt wrong\nmeans, not to tell lies and cause harm to the nation for selfish interests.\nThis was the basic lesson taught by him to everyone, adults and children,\nand the moment we forget that lesson, we will fall.\n      Therefore as we enter the thirteenth year, let us do so with heads\nheld high and march in step with the firm determination that we shall reach\nour goal in time.\n        Jai Hind.

Greetings to all of you on this auspicious occasion. But are we\nassembled here merely as a matter of routine or to witness a spectacle or\nwith some other motive? Eleven years ago, when our National Flag was\nunfurled for the first time from the ramparts of the Red Fort, it was a\nred-letter day in the history of India and the world. It was a special day not\nonly because India became free on that day but because the manner in\nwhich she won that freedom, with honour and peace, was unique, it set an\nexample for the world. We held our heads high once more and respect for\nus grew in the world.\n      Eleven years have passed since then and this period has been full of\ntension and problems for us. Our hearts were full of joy on the day we\nunfurled the flag of freedom eleven years ago, joy at the thought of having\nreached our goal. But even before the first flush of joy had subsided,\nanother kind of news began to reach us. We were full of pride that we had\nwon freedom honourably peacefully and non-violently, but then reports\nreached us of the terrible carnage that presented a completely different\npicture before us. The communal riots spread to Delhi and elsewhere and\nwe saw how close we were to defeat at the very moment of victory. At\ndaybreak we were celebrating our victory and sunset we had a glimpse of\ndefeat too. We had not lost the battle to an enemy; we had won it. The\ndefeat lay in our weakness and folly, which are most dangerous. We faced\nthe enemy boldly, tigerlike but a poisonous snake came from behind and bit\nus. Therefore, I would like to warn you that once again such poisonous\nsnakes are rearing their heads and they can bite us, weaken us, lead to our\ndownfall and destroy everything that we have built up patiently over the\nyears.\n      We are assembled here today to celebrate this day and also to look\nback a little on the past. There is pressure of the present-day problems and\nalso a glimpse of the future. We have embarked on a great journey. The\njourney towards freedom was over after a long and arduous march and\nnow an even more difficult journey lies ahead in which 36, 37 crores of\nIndians must march together. We are marching holding each others' hands\ntoward prosperity and trying to alleviate the sufferings of the people and to\nensure that the primary necessities of life are available to them. We are\ntoiling so that the shadow of bondage may never fall on our pretty little\nchildren. They were born in free India and they must always remain free\nwith heads held high and live in prosperity and always advance towards a\nbetter future.\n      We envisaged such a future and are marching towards it but there\nare a thousand pitfalls and difficulties in the way. Sometimes, there are\nfloods or droughts or too much rain and yet the condition is much worse\nwhen there are no rains. You know the tremendous difficulties we have had\nto face in this country during the last few years. But we faced them with\ncourage and in spite of difficulties and problems. India has always held her\nhead high and never bowed down to adversity. This is a testing time for us,\nand a far more difficult challenge than the freedom struggle. It is a testing\ntime for our ability to be united in adversity, our spirit of cooperation and the\ndetermination to cross hurdles and reach the goals that we have set before\nus. So, at a time like this, if there is disunity among us and people squabble\nwith each other and become violent, what does it mean? Does it mean that\nwe have forgotten the lessons taught by Mahatma Gandhi? Have we\nforgotten thousands of years of India's history? Are we not ignoring the\nentire future of the younger generation for whom we are toiling today?\nWhat do we think when we indulge in petty squabbles and raise our hands\nin hatred against our fellow men merely to gain some political ends? I do\nnot know why we behave like this.\n       I stand before you as you are gathered here to celebrate this day.\nThere is joy in my heart but there is also grief that even 11 years after\nIndependence incidents of rioting and violence are taking place in some\nparts of the country and that too on this day. We must remain vigilant and\nsee that people are not misled. I am standing here not to criticise anyone. It\nis not my job. Nor am I standing here as a representative of any group or\nany party. I am standing here as a traveller, a fellow traveller travelling with\nmillions of people living in this country I appeal to you to peep into your\nhearts, your real feelings and think about what is your duty at the moment\nand also tell others what is expected of them. It is obvious that, whatever\nbe our policy, we can succeed only if we work peacefully and without any\ndisturbance. This is a well-known fact. Otherwise our energy will be frittered\naway in useless wrangling with each other. We must talk to one another if\nthere is a difference of opinion. There is no other alternative in this country.\n       We loudly advise the world and talk self-righteously. We have raised\naloft the banner of Panchsheel and people's attention has been drawn to it.\nIt has had an impact on other countries. But when our behaviour within the\ncountry is contrary to what we preach and is exposed to the whole world to\nsee, we cannot but bow our heads in shame. How can we presume to give\nadvice to others when we cannot control ourselves? Therefore, my appeal\nto you and everyone in the country is that, while we should certainly think of\nother problems and no matter what policy we follow, we must not forget\nthat it is of fundamental importance to maintain equanimity and eschew\nviolence and realise that if we continue to indulge in internal squabbles and\npetty feuds, there can be neither freedom nor socialism nor democracy. No\nmatter what your views are, if you try to settle your differences by threats of\nviolence, you will achieve nothing. This is the situation also in the world\ntoday when the Great Powers are sitting on big arsenals and hold atom\nbombs. Each one of these powers has the strength to destroy the world but\nno power has the means of stabilising the situation through war. The only\nhope for the world lies in maintaining peace.\n      Gradually, it is beginning to dawn upon the world that war spells ruin,\nand yet preparations for war are going on all the time and everyone lives in\nfear. As you know, recently a dangerous situation arose in the countries of\nWest Asia. Even now military forces are arrayed in that region, in constant\nreadiness to fight. It is hoped that there will be no war and the mutual fear\nand tension will subside and that the problem will be solved soon and our\nfriends will be able to live in complete peace. The Arab countries have\nfought for several years for freedom and are succeeding slowly. We hope\nthat there will be no threat to their liberty and that they will be able to enjoy\nthe right of self-determination and will live in friendship and amity with one\nanother.\n       This is the situation in the world today. Please remember that India is\nheld in great respect in the world and its opinion carries weight. It is\nregarded as a sensible nation which does not get carried away easily or lift\na hand in anger against anyone. This is how the world sees us. How far\nthis is right or wrong is left to you to decide, for it is both right and wrong to\nsome extent. It is right in so far as it was proved by our non-violence and\nself-restraint during the lifetime of Mahatma Gandhi. But now our own\nactions prove it wrong. So I appeal to you to think about these matters.\nLook at what is happening in the cities of Gujarat, which is the State of\nGandhiji's birth and where he taught his lessons assiduously to the\nhard-working people who have made tremendous sacrifices and are\ncounted among the most enlightened people in India. In Gujarat today\nthere is a strange atmosphere of madness. People are defaming\nthemselves and the country. Gujarat is a good State. We must remain\nvigilant and think where such madness will lead us. It has no connection\nwith any policy or decision. In an independent country everyone has the\nright to have his own views and express them before others. But nobody\nhas the right to coerce anyone at the point of a gun or a lathi to change his\nview. Such behaviour will only spell ruin and lead to unnecessary conflicts.\nHave we toiled for so long for India's freedom only to fall into this abysmal\npit of internal weakness? You should think about this.\n       The youth in India have a bright future before them. It is in their hands\nthat the future responsibility of India lies and so they must prepare\nthemselves for it wherever they may be, in schools or colleges or\nelsewhere. But many of them get carried away and forget the main issues\ndue to their petty preoccupations and wranglings. They make themselves\nuseless in the process and do not serve the country in any way. So we\nmust think seriously about where we are heading. It is obvious that after\nhaving reached where we are today, after facing thousands of difficulties\nand problems, we are not going to yield before any threat or give up\nbecause of any weakness. Our work will go on and we must move forward\nwith courage, no matter what obstacles come in our way. We must\novercome our weaknesses and keep moving with our heads held high.\n       Eleven years have passed since Independence. It is a long time,\nthough not perhaps in the life of a nation. You know what was India's\ncondition was 11 years ago or even earlier and compare it with India's\nposition in the world today or even at home. All of us have thousands of\ngrievances, many of which are genuine and some are not genuine.\nHowever, we have had to face several disasters, like floods, drought and\ncrop failures and as a consequence, rise in prices. People are facing great\ndifficulties and their complaints are justified. I do not deny this. Traders and\nbusinessmen, instead of helping the nation in the time of crisis, are\nresorting to black marketeering and other wrong activities. Your complaints\nare fully justified because such activities are harmful to the nation, are\nunpatriotic. People who indulge in unlawful activities should realise the\nconsequences of their actions.\n       Well, we are facing problems of great magnitude in India and the\nworld. We are part of the world and so we have to participate in its affairs.\nBut our real problems are within the country. Whether we live in\nKanyakumari or Rameshwaram in the South or in Kashmir in the North or\nin the East or in the West, we are one nation and we will not allow anyone\nto break it up. You and I and all of us are citizens of India and not merely\nresidents of our own narrow streets or cities or States, and do not belong\nonly to the North, South, East or West. This must be understood quite\nclearly because those who are against this and weaken India's unity will\nhave to contend with us. We must fight against these tendencies whether\nthey arise in the country or outside. India's unity and freedom are most\nimportant without which there can be no firm basis for India's prosperity. I\nagree that we have made mistakes and slipped up many times, as nobody\nis infallible. But what we need is to keep the fire of determination and zeal\nburning in our hearts and minds, which will lead us towards our goal. If we\nstumble and fall, we must have the strength and ability to stand up\nimmediately and march on.\n       Some people seem to think that the days are gone when it was\nnecessary to show bravery and courage as we did when we were fighting\nagainst the might of imperialism. Let no one be under any illusion about\nthis. India has tremendous life in her, more than earlier though sometimes\nwe commit mistakes and lose sight of larger issues in the heat of the\nmoment. Perhaps occasional jolts and shocks are good as they remind us\nabout what we are and where our duty lies and keep us on the right path.\n      So, we are once again assembled at this historic Red Fort, which had\nbeen a symbol of bondage for centuries and now is a symbol of our\nfreedom. We assemble here not merely as a matter of duty, but to remind\nourselves about the pledges and promises that we have made, and about\nthe path that we must follow to fulfil those pledges and promises. We\nassemble here to remember our great leaders, especially Mahatma\nGandhi, who brought us here. Many of you who are young may not have\nseen him and to you he is only a legend. In fact, the entire history of our\nfreedom struggle has become a legend and it will always be an\nunforgettable legend. It is not a story but a lesson which we shall always\nremember. We must remember that lesson today when we are deviating\nfrom the right path. Let us pay homage to the memory of Mahatma Gandhi\nwho enabled this country to rise and attain freedom and who ultimately laid\ndown his life for the sake of the nation.\n     Jai Hind! Please say Jai Hind with me thrice.\n     Jai Hind! Jai Hind!

It\nmight have worried some of you whose clothes are slightly drenched. But in\nthis rain I see a symbol of our country's prosperity, of its becoming green\nand fertile and our hearts also being refreshed. Children, my greetings to\nyou on this auspicious day, it is you who will build the future of this country.\nYou have to prepare yourselves with firm determination and stout hearts to\nembark on the journey of wiping out poverty from the country in the same\nunited way in which we wiped out slavery. We have completed one journey\nof consolidating our freedom, the foundations of which were laid a hundred\nyears ago by our people with their blood sweat and tears. We have before\nus now another journey of emancipating our people economically. But any\nnation that undertakes the mighty task of wiping out unemployment and\npoverty is bound to meet with reverses. We often stumbled and fell in our\nstruggle for freedom. We faced heartbreaking reverses, but we did not give\nup. We again rose and marched on. In the same way today we have to\nface the challenges of these economic and other difficulties in a united and\nfirm manner and rebuild a new India.\n       How many among you here remember the face of India before\nfreedom? If you do not remember it, you cannot compare the conditions in\nthose days in the cities and villages with the present times? It was a\ntremendous task, requiring hard work to change those conditions. It could\nnot be done by magic. It was hard and persistent work, which brought India\nfreedom. We require this capacity for hard work and unity to rebuild a new\nIndia. Whenever a country wants to go forward rapidly, it has to face the\nchallenge of many odds. We have to understand that we may stumble and\nfall. Only those people do not stumble, who are always sitting at ease or\njust reclining. When people march forward, they are bound to stumble. We\nhave gone forward in this way:\n                  Is tarah tave kee hain hamnain manzilen\n                   Gir paray, gir kar uthay, uth kar chalev\n(We have reached our goals in a manner where we stumbled fell down and\n                      rose, and marched again.)\nMany people when faced with difficulties tend to lose heart and turn their\nbacks and slink away. They are frightened by these difficulties which\nappear to them like a big mountain. But big things are only achieved by\nfacing difficulties of every kind. One can see the progress India has\nachieved by looking around at the conditions in the neighbouring countries.\nWe are not so much worried about the world as we are about our own duty\nto our country. We have taken a big job on our hands. We are doing it. And\nwe will do it.\n       On this historic day, memories of a hundred years of glorious struggle\nand achievements beckon us to greater effort. The torch of freedom, lit by\nthe freedom fighters a hundred years ago like Tatya Tope, Nana Sahib,\nKunwar Singh, Liaquat Ali Khan and above all the Rani of Jhansi, was kept\naloft and burning by those who succeeded them. Dadabhai Naoroji,\nLokmanya Tilak and Mahatma Gandhi in their turn carried the torch and\nfaced the might of British Imperialism. We have today to remember the\nlessons of unity, religious tolerance and fellow feeling taught by Mahatma\nGandhi and other great sons of India and go forward in a united and\ndetermined manner.\n       India is celebrating today the Tenth Anniversary of her Independence\nand the First Centenary of the 1857 Struggle. Some historians have tried to\nbelittle the importance of the War of Independence of a hundred years ago.\nBut the basic fact is that the India of those times did rise gloriously against\nthe foreign yoke and a large majority of common people joined the struggle.\nAnd people of all religions, Hindus, Muslims and others, together rose and\nbore every suffering to attain freedom. There is no doubt that it was a War\nof Independence in which the foundations of freedom were laid with the\nblood of the people. The most lovable name of the freedom fighters of\nthose times is of Rani Lakshmi Bai of Jhansi. These names are in our\nhearts and will remain in our hearts always. Their memory will remain fresh\nfor centuries.\n     Now, our neighbour Pakistan is a part of our heart and body. How\ncan we ever think of fighting against Pakistan? This would only be\ntantamount to harming ourselves. If Pakistan through its foolishness\nentertained enmity towards us, it would be only harming itself. No doubt our\nrelationship with Pakistan is strange because even if there is bitterness\nagainst each other, even if there is some anger, it is a very close\nrelationship of thousands of years which mere laws cannot obliterate. If\nsome harm comes to India, it is bound to harm Pakistan also. Similarly, if\nPakistan is harmed, it will affect India too.\n       So, we want that we remain in peace and friendship with Pakistan\nand our relations grow in such a manner that they remain happy in their\nfreedom and we remain happy in our freedom. This does not imply that\nIndia can be cowed down by threats and made to abandon her rights. It will\nbe neither doing justice to ourselves, nor to Pakistan nor to others. It would\nnot be a good example too. So, we will remain firm on our rights and\ndefend them with all our strength and with cool minds and go forward. We\nwill be friends of all.\n      Coming to the international situation, India does not like the cold war\nwhich is raging in the world. We think this cold war engenders jealousy in\nthe heart. It is a wrong thing. It makes the heart narrow. No country can\ngrow in this manner. India's hand of friendship is stretched out towards all\ncountries. We want to shake hands with all countries.\n      But in the ultimate analysis, India's position in the world will depend\non her own internal achievements. If India is respected today in the world, it\nis because of our achievements during the last ten years. The world has\ntaken note of a strong nation having entered the world arena, a nation\nwhich is making progress rapidly. So, it is only after seeing our ten years'\nwork, that the world has begun to respect us.\n       There may be passing difficulties but they have to be overcome with\ndetermined effort. We will overcome them and step by step our nation will\ngo forward. There will be more work and we will be able to eliminate\nunemployment and especially the suffering of our people, living in villages\nor cities today, who for centuries have borne the burdens of poverty. We\nhave completed one journey of freedom. The second journey has just\nbegun. It is before us. We will reach its end also by remaining united.\n       We have gathered here in hundreds and thousands to celebrate this\nday. This day is the Tenth Anniversary of our Free India and the Centenary\nof the big War of Independence, which took place here a hundred years\nago. You are here in your big numbers, but more than that, other people\nwere gathered here too. The memories of those caravans which came\nhere, caravans of people who showed courage, served India, served our\nnation, and went away after doing their duty. They may be here or they\nmay be in our minds or they may be seeing what India's position today is\nafter a hundred years. It is ultimately the efforts made by these people\nthrough their blood, sweat and tears, who gave their lives for the country,\nthat have brought the results which we see today. It is this story of ups and\ndowns of a hundred years that we see today in this city of Delhi and\nespecially in this Red Fort, whose every stone relates this story.\n        Before me is Chandni Chowk, the famous bazar of Delhi for\ncenturies. This Chandni Chowk has seen mighty processions of kings and\nemperors, it has seen the country taking a turn in its history, it has seen the\nfall of a mighty empire and the birth of a new State. Here processions went\nby of old India, of Moghul emperors, of British rulers, on big elephants.\nThose times came and went and now Free India's time has come. We are\ntoday seeing the truths of a hundred years of struggle. We have now to see\nthat we preserve the fruits of this struggle.\n      In these ten years the face of India has changed to some extent and\nour voice has reached the ears of other people in the world. This is a voice\nwhich is a little different from the voices they have been hearing. We did\nnot growl, we did not shout because we learnt our lessons under the\nleadership of Mahatma Gandhi, who worked silently. But behind this silent\nwork of ours there is determination and strength. India entered the world\narena as one of the wrestlers. But it is not to fight anyone, but to serve\nourselves and to some extent serve the world also. During the last ten\nyears, the path has been cleared to some extent for the people of India to\ngo forward. Many thorns in this path have been cleared and brushed aside.\nBut still some more thorns remain. In the political field, the path has been\nvery much cleared. India has now to clear the economic path and go\nforward.\n       Now, the world is facing a strange situation. The atomic and\nhydrogen bombs are hanging on the head of the world menacingly and no\none knows when they explode. Yet, this same atomic power can be used\nfor the good of humanity.\n       India today is facing many problems. The one relating to foodgrains is\nespecially important. The prices of foodgrains are rising, affecting\neveryone, But the burden on those whose income is low is more than on\nothers. That is a matter which certainly cause worry. But it is a worldwide\nphenomenon, India, however, will get over that and other problems. The\ntrouble is that big projects like steel plants and river valley schemes take\nsome time to complete. The results that flowed from them will come only\nafter some time. But all those are definite signs of the people going\nforward. The whole of India today is like a big workshop where the kisan,\nthe mill worker and the engineer or anybody else are immersed in their\ndaily tasks. The day is coming nearer when the entire nation will reap the\nfruits of these big projects. We must remember that we have to stand on\nour own legs. Nobody will come from outside to take us forward. We have\nto depend on our own efforts. India is both an old country and a new one. It\nhas its past of 5,000 years. Yet, it is a young country which is only ten\nyears old. We have to see where we are going today. Our War of\nIndependence was started 100 years ago with blood. It was suppressed.\nEven though it was put down for the time being, the battle was not over. It\nwas continued by others in later years who consolidated the unity of the\npeople, and brought them together.\n       The Buddha Jayanti celebrations took place last year and the 2,500th\nbirth anniversary of the great son of India had refreshed the minds of the\npeople and the impact that his teachings made on vast masses of humanity\nis tremendous. It is that message of peace and love taught by the Buddha\nand Mahatma Gandhi that has given strength and unity to the people of\nIndia. We can go forward only when we continue to follow these principles\nand work in a cooperative and united manner.

Greetings to all of you on the ninth anniversary of Indian\nindependence. The new star of independent India blazed out in the\nfirmament nine years ago. India was new and yet very old too, at the same\ntime, a country moulded by centuries of experience and by the sacrifice,\nhard work, blood, sweat and tears of its people. India donned a new garb in\nthe time of Mahatma Gandhi, she acquired a new glitter and a new manner.\nYou will remember how we fought for freedom during the last two\ngenerations. We struggled, millions of us, with courage and bravery. We\nstruggled gloriously, in a civilized manner, without lifting a finger against\nanyone. We fought with the enemy but made a friend of him. It was a\nunique method that we adopted. Rather Gandhiji did, and we followed him\nas best as we could. That is how the millions of human beings in this\ncountry of ours have been moulded. This is how we became independent.\n      The independence of India has had an impact on other nations also.\nNot because we are a vast country in size with some 35-37 crore living\nhere. But because the world saw a unique method unfolding before them,\nan entirely novel method of fighting a war in a civilized manner. I want to\nremind you that the real greatness of India lies in this and it has had a great\nimpact on the world. We acquired a new pride in ourselves and were\nemboldened to play a role on the world stage. We had a hand in solving\nsome big international problems. At the moment when war drums can be\nheard in the distance and the world is preparing for war, all eyes are drawn\ntowards India. Not because we have big armies or that we use threats to\nachieve our ends but because we have learnt to serve and make friends\nwith others. It is because we have helped to bring about peace in war-torn\nareas, and to unravel knotty problems, that India has become famous in the\nworld. There are grave dangers facing the world today. Therefore we must\nrefresh our memories about the lessons learnt long ago and try to serve the\nworld.\n      You must have heard of the expression Panchsheel. It had its origin\nin our country thousands of years ago but has acquired a new meaning\nnow. It is a code of conduct between the nations of the world. There are\nlong traditions as well as new ideas behind this concept which has\ngradually spread and come to be accepted by many nations of the world.\nThere are only two courses open to the world today. One is of war and ruin\nand the second is of peace and Panchsheel. There is no third path. The\nworld is gradually beginning to realize this.\n       Today grave danger threatens us once again and the world is in\ndeadly peril. Good as well as bad things have happened in this month of\nAugust. We meet here on the 15th of August to celebrate the anniversary\nof our independence and the end of centuries of colonialism and\nimperialism, and the beginning of a new era. It was in August that both the\nworld wars, in 1914 as well as 1939, began. It was in August that the\nSecond World War came to an end when Japan laid down its arms on the\n15th of August. So it is an eventful month, full of dangers and at the same\ntime of a number of good things too. So we must be vigilant. Danger there\nis in plenty because this is the age of nuclear weapons. There is no room\nfor complacency or forgetting our responsibilities even for a minute. Nor\ncan we afford to forget the lessons taught by Gandhiji. If we do, it is bound\nto lead to ruin.\n      I hope that in the conference which is going to be held in London from\ntomorrow in connection with the Suez crisis, a way will be found to settle\nthis matter peacefully. We have friendly relations with all the countries and\nparticularly with Egypt and England. Therefore we are given the opportunity\nto be of service to both through friendship. We do not use threats, for whom\ncan we threaten? I hope that through mutual consultations the participants\nin the conference will find some way to uphold the honour and self-respect\nof both sides. It is only those decisions which do not humiliate one side or\nthe other that are enduring. Humiliation sows the seeds of enmity and war.\nIf matters are settled by friendly methods, the solution is more permanent.\n     Do you remember how the centuries old problem of India's\nindependence was solved? In spite of great difficulties and the atrocities\nwhich were committed, it was solved by peaceful methods, friendship and\ncooperation, with the result that there is no vestige of bitterness between\nthe British and us. We have even tried to forget the old bitterness\naltogether and now we have friendly relations with England. We solved our\nproblems peacefully, in a civilized manner. If we had tried to use violence\nor coercion, the pattern would have been quite different. We would have\nbecome free but the bitterness would have remained for a long time. So\nthere is only one way of solving problems and that is by not humiliating\nanyone and the preservation of rights and the self-respect of both sides. I\nhope that the Suez crisis will also be solved like this. Even if it is not solved\nin London efforts should continue. No problem will be solved by military\nstrength or threats because the consequences of such actions would be\ndisastrous. It could start a conflagration which would engulf the world.\n       I just now mentioned Panchsheel, words which originated in India and\nhave spread all over the world. But when I look at India, I wonder how far\nwe have been able to understand the five principles ourselves. In the last\nseven or eight months, we have seen some strange spectacles in the\ncountry, with men fighting against their own kin. We fought the enemy\nsuccessfully and made friends with them and yet we do not have the\npatience and understanding to solve our own internal problems. Has the\ninfluence of Mahatma Gandhi vanished completely? Is it only the people of\nmy generation who were moulded by his teachings? Has it left the\nsucceeding generations so untouched that there is no self-control, mental\nor physical, among them? What is the matter? I want you to think about\nthis. Our youth go out on the streets and beat up people. Is this the way to\nshow their bravery, by beating up their own kith and kin? In our time, we\nhave faced the guns and the might of a great empire without a word of\ncomplaint. What are the youth made of today? Have the qualities in which\nwe were moulded and which led to India's freedom and fame in the world\ndisappeared? I am getting old. We have become old in the service of the\ncountry. Our days are almost over. But we have proved what we were\ncapable of in the service of the country. We learnt a unique method of\nworking at Gandhiji's feet and we were proud of that. India acquired a great\nname in the world. Therefore when people come out on the streets to fight\nover petty issues, one wonders where India is going. All of you must think\nabout this.\n       As you know the question of the reorganization of states has come\nup. It is not a great political or economic issue but merely a matter of\nadministrative arrangement. I agree that it is a sentimental issue. I agree\nthat people are interested in it and their sentiments ought to be respected.\nBut it is absurd for people to fight with one another, and resort to arson, loot\nand damaging public property. These will lead to the country's ruin. After\nall, the ultimate decision will be taken by the Parliament which has\nrepresentatives from all over the country. And the people of India should\naccept the decision of Parliament\n       It is absurd that there should be riots against the decisions of\nParliament - there are cases of burning of government buildings, beating up\nthe police and what not. I want all of you and all the opposition parties in\nIndia to think seriously about these matters. In a large country like ours,\nthere are bound to be different opinions and strands of thoughts. We want\nthat there should be complete freedom of expression so that we can\nchoose a path which is best suited to us. But debate is one thing, violence\nanother. Any party which leads India towards violence is not patriotic. It\nstrikes at the roots of India's freedom. Every individual and party in India\nmust think carefully about these things.\n       Soon we are going to have general elections. Everyone has the right\nto express his views and parties can present their programme to the people\nand try to bring them round to their opinion. If you do not like the present\ngovernment, you are welcome to change it. I will be happy to serve in any\ncapacity. But violence and chaos have no connection with democracy. We\nmust think carefully where all this will lead us. Is the carefully moulded\ncivilization of India beginning to develop cracks? India has been moulded\nby thousands of years of culture which cannot be taken away from us.\nSecondly, we have been moulded by the freedom struggle. If the people\nrepresent neither the old nor the new but believe only in hooliganism, how\ncan they serve India?\n      New avenues are opening up. The Five Year Plans are big steps. But\nthey also impose a tremendous burden. We will have to face a great\nchallenge in the years to come and we will have to pit all our strength and\nenergy into the tasks ahead. To argue over the boundaries of states is\nabsurd. I want everyone, particularly the youth, to think where they are\ngoing. Are we adhering to the principle of Panchsheel in our own country?\n       Panchsheel means friendship with all the countries. How can we\npractise that when we are not able to be friendly towards our own\nneighbours? So long as we continue to fight over petty issues, no decision\ncan be arrived at. As far as the government is concerned, you have every\nright to remove it from power. But threats will have no impact on us. The\ndecision of Parliament is binding and will be implemented. It cannot be\nchanged by such obstructionist tactics.\n      Everyone must understand quite clearly that the decision of the Lok\nSabha about the states reorganization will be binding. You have put me in\na position of great honour. But ultimately it is the will of Parliament which is\nsupreme and all of us will have to bow to it. Everyone must understand this\nclearly. There are legal, constitutional methods of changing the decisions of\nParliament. But anyone who thinks he can change the decisions by rioting\nis mistaken. It would be an unpatriotic act against national interest.\n      On this ninth anniversary of our independence, we must look back as\nwell as to the future. India has come a long way in nine years and the new\nIndia which is emerging is held in great respect in the world. We must keep\nour eyes on the future and march ahead. We must implement the Five Year\nPlans with strength and determination and pour all our energy into it. We\ncannot afford to fritter away our strength in futile acts. We have to build a\nnew India by getting rid of poverty and unemployment and reducing the\ndisparity between the haves and the have-nots. India must emerge as a\nstrong and prosperous nation and serve humanity and the cause of peace.\nThese are difficult tasks. But we are accustomed to difficulties. On this day,\nwe must not only look back on our past, but also look at the future and take\na pledge to abide by our ancient culture and civilization, and not stray from\nour chosen path.\n      This year we are celebrating yet another great anniversary. Two\nthousand and five hundred years ago Gautama Buddha attained nirvana.\nThe Buddha is held in great reverence not only in India but all over the\nworld because what he stood for are enduring, eternal truths which do not\ndisappear with the passing of time.\n       One feels proud that the soil on which we have been born has\nproduced great souls like Gautama Buddha and Gandhiji. There is\nsomething in this soil which has kept the nation together by a strong bond.\nIt is something spiritual which is reflected in our ancient culture and\ncivilization. Let us refresh our memories once again and pay homage to\nGautama Buddha and Gandhiji and great souls like them who have\nmoulded this country. Let us follow the path shown by them with strength\nand determination and cooperation.\n     Jai Hind. Please say Jai Hind with me thrice."},{"year":1955,"pm":"Jawaharlal Nehru","party":"INC","title":"Decisions through Peaceful Means","footnote":"Speech at the Red Fort, Delhi, 15 August 1955, AIR tapes, NMML.

Greetings to everyone on this auspicious occasion. Do you\nremember that day when we reached this goal after a long journey and\nmany ups and downs? Many people stumbled and fell, picked themselves\nup and moved on again. Do you remember the dreams we dreamt and the\nhopes that filled our hearts. Then came a day when those dreams and\nhopes were fulfilled and we saw the sun emerging on free India. Eight\nyears have passed since that day when the whole of India went wild with\njoy. But in the moment of joy and triumph came tears too at the inhuman\natrocities that took place on both sides of the border. Innumerable refugees\ntrekked for hundreds of miles to cross the borders on both sides. We had to\nface this grave crisis. Well, we bore our troubles and tried to solve those\nproblems quite successfully. We will undoubtedly solve the rest too. In this\nway, eight years have passed, with a great many ups and downs. Just think\nback to the condition we were in eight years ago and the way world saw us\nand the difference that has come about in the entire scene since then.\nIndependent India is still in her infancy, though our nation is thousands of\nyears old. But the world knows of our achievements and the capacity to\nadvance that we have shown even in these few years.\n      So when we meet here, we look back towards the past and the last\neight years especially, as well as to the future. We must take stock of what\nwe have done and what remains to be done. There is a tremendous\namount that still has to be dealt with. We must pay special attention to our\nweaknesses, for it is only to the extent that we succeed in removing those\nweaknesses will the country advance and the people prosper. Turning\ntowards the world, you will find that we have not raised our hand against\nany nation of the world and I hope that we shall never do so. We have\nlooked upon everyone with friendly eyes and extended the hand of\nfriendship and peace. There have been some complicated issues but that\nwas no reason for us to be hostile to anyone. Ultimately, the policy of\npeace and friendship that we are following is the only right one for the\nworld. We want to have friendly relations and cooperation with our\nneighbouring countries. You would have known about the strengthening of\nrelations in the recent past. You must have heard about Panch Shila which\nlays down the norms of conduct between nations. Gradually all the newly\nindependent countries have accepted these principles and the atmosphere\nin the world has changed for the better. I do not say that this is because of\nus there have been other events in the world. So we must not be proud or\nboastful about it. It is sufficient if we can help in our own small way. But\nwhat makes us happy is that the atmosphere in the world is definitely better\nthan before, the fear and anxiety with which nations used to regard one\nanother have become less, and there is a readiness among them to extend\nthe hand of a we are happy.\n       We are at peace with all the countries of the world. But on this day,\nthe 15th of August, our thoughts turn towards Goa. When we were busy\nfighting for our freedom, could you or anyone in the world have thought that\nwhile India would become free, the small pockets of Goa or Pondicherry or\nany other place would remain under European rule? It was inconceivable\nand we did not even dream of such a thing. Pondicherry and Goa have\nbeen separated from us for the last two or three hundred years. They could\nflourish separately under the protection of the huge British empire in India\njust as the innumerable princely states existed with the blessings of the\nBritish. The moment the British left, all those princely states also had to go.\nSo it is rather strange that anyone should ask us why we want Goa to\nmerge with India. Where is the question of merging with India? Hasn't\nanyone seen the map of India and the world and where Goa is? It is a part\nof India and nobody can separate it. Today we are celebrating the eighth\nanniversary of our independence. As the world has seen, we have shown a\ngreat deal of patience in these eight years. We have exercised great\nself-control because we want that this issue should be solved peacefully.\nLet me tell you once again today that we have no intention of taking military\naction in Goa but will solve it by peaceful methods. Let no one be under a\nmisconception that we are going to take military action. I am saying this\nbecause people abroad as well as in India are sometimes misled. Rumours\nare being circulated abroad that we are amassing tanks and guns and our\narmy there. It is all wrong. There are no forces near Goa. People within the\ncountry want to create a situation by making a great deal of noise whereby\nwe will be forced to march in. We will not send in our forces and we will\nsettle the matter peacefully. Let everyone understand this clearly. Those\nwho are going into Goa are welcome to do so, but if they call themselves\nsatyagrahis, let them remember the principles of satyagraha and behave\naccordingly. Armies do not march behind satyagrahis. Nor is there a call for\nthem. They are supposed to face the issue themselves in a completely\ndifferent way.\n        We have seen recently that the satyagrahis were fired upon on a\nnumber of occasions and some young men died as a result. Guns are fired\nin wars and that has to be faced. But the world must seriously consider how\nfar it is proper or right for any nation to fire upon unarmed people. If a law is\nbroken, the government has the right to arrest the culprits and put them in\njails. But nowhere in international law or any law governing civilized\nbehaviour is it written that unarmed people who are not mounting any kind\nof an attack should be fired upon. It is absolutely wrong. I would like to\npoint out very politely that the world and the Portuguese Government must\nunderstand quite clearly that they must not indulge in such uncivilized\nbehaviour. There is a conflict between us but whatever their views may be,\nwe wish to solve the problem peacefully and will undoubtedly do so, no\nmatter how long it takes. Please bear in mind that it is wrong to think that\nsuch issues can be resolved by magic immediately. If we wish to arrive at a\nproper solution, being in a hurry will not help. We must wait because\nanything which is done slowly and with patience is likely to be more firm\nand abiding.\n      I mentioned Panch Shila and drew your attention to the changing\natmosphere in the world. Take the internal situation, for ultimately, our\nstature in the world depends on what we do in our own country. We shall\nnot gain in stature by shouting slogans or talking irresponsibly. We are\njudged by what we are doing in the country. I feel that we have achieved a\ngreat deal in the last eight years and have laid the foundation of the edifice\nof new India and now the time has come to build on it. The foundations are\nstrong and will become stronger still. The First Five Year Plan will come to\nan end soon and the Second will start in a few months. We must prepare\nourselves for it by tightening our belts and must be ready for any hardship\nbecause we are building a nation not merely for the present but for the\nfuture and all the coming generations. It has to be a strong nation and built\nwith hard labour.\n      I talked about Panch Shila in the context of international relations. In\nthe olden days this word was used in a different sense. It meant discipline\nand self-control, good behaviour towards others and so on. How can we\nhave a high stature in the world if we are weak internally? How can we talk\nabout peace elsewhere if there is no peace in our hearts? If we cannot\ncooperate with one another, how can we advise others? Therefore, it is\neven more important for us to remove our weaknesses.\n       This wonderful country of ours, India, has so many facets and forms,\nso many religions, and shades of opinions, so many regions and provinces.\nAll of them together have gone into the making of modern India. We are\none large family and there should be no barriers of province and religion\nand caste among us. We must break down any barriers that exist. We must\nremove casteism, for it is responsible for our living in separate\ncompartments. It has weakened India, a great deal in the past. So while we\nmust preserve India's wonderful diversity, we must at the same time\nremember that we belong to one family and have to march together\ntowards the new goal that is before us.\n       Secondly, whatever we do, it must be done by peaceful methods. I\nwant to remind you of this particularly because we talk of peace but often\nraise our hands in violence against one another. What is the meaning of\nsuch things? Just two days ago an incident occurred in the city of Patna.\nWhy are we so ready to do violence? Why is it that our students get so\neasily involved in such things? Do they lack patience and understanding?\nDon't they know that they are citizens of independent India? Have they\nfailed to breathe in the air of freedom and are still thinking on the old lines?\nThose times are gone now. If there is tension among workers or anyone\nelse, and especially if the students come into conflict with their teachers\nand indulge in violence, they earn a bad name for themselves as well as for\nthe country, instead of preparing themselves for the responsibilities that the\nfuture will bring. I plead with all of you, especially our youth, to realize your\nresponsibilities and understand the spirit of modern age. The whole world\nhas taken a new turn. This is the age of the atom and atomic energy. We\nhave to change our thinking and get out of the old rut of petty feuds and\nquarrels. I want the people of India to understand these things and take\nadvantage of the new forces being generated in the world. Therefore, it\nbecomes necessary for us to solve all our problems by peaceful methods.\n       Another complex problem is about to come up in the country. As you\nmay remember, some time ago a commission was appointed called the\nStates Reoreanimation Commission. It will make recommendations for\nreorganizing the boundaries of the various provinces. We selected three\neminent people to study this question in depth and make their\nrecommendations. They have been working on it for the last year and a\nhalf. I think they will present their report within the next two months. I do not\nknow what their recommendations will be. I cannot express an opinion. But\nwhat I want to say is that in spite of the great heat that is bound to be\ngenerated over this issue from the Punjab to the south and from east to\nwest, we must take a decision on the recommendations of the Commission\npeacefully. Whoever creates a stir over it will not be a well-wisher of the\ncountry. For after all it is only a question of separate provinces, not\nseparate countries. These divisions have been made for our administrative\nconvenience. No decision will be acceptable to everyone. But an effort will\nbe made and I hope that the Commission is already making such an effort\nto recommend whatever will be acceptable to the majority. Whatever\nhappens, we must accept it peacefully after due consideration. There\nshould be no quarrel over this issue. We must show the world how we\nsolve our problems peacefully, and with confidence in ourselves. That is\nthe real sign of strength, not shouting slogans and making a noise. That is\nchildishness. Though independent India is only eight years old, our country\nis an ancient one. It is a grand country which speaks with a serious voice. It\nis not our practice to shout or rant and rave. This is not the time for such\nthings. We have to add to our strength, always act peacefully and with\npatience, extend the hand of friendship towards other countries and behave\nin a civilized way. Whatever problems arise, they must be solved peacefully\nand harmoniously.\n       I talked to you about Panch Shila. There are two aspects to it. One\nconcerns international relations of friendship, non-interference in one\nanother's internal affairs, equality and mutual cooperation. The second\naspect of Panch Shila concerns us internally, it consists of right conduct,\nalertness, self-control, unity and harmony, through these we can build,\nstrengthen the large family of the people of India. This is a very old lesson\ntaught to us thousands of years ago and is before us once again. Please\nbear in mind that unless we teach ourselves this lesson. we have no right\nto preach it to others. It would be arrogance to presume to teach others. If\nwe learn the lesson well and put it into practice, we can show the others by\nexample. Therefore, while it is proper that we should celebrate the eighth\nanniversary of India's freedom and take stock of our achievements in the\nlast eight years, in reality we must concentrate our attention on the tasks\nthat are waiting to be done. We have reached one goal and now we have\nto travel towards another, and that journey should also be peaceful.\n\n\n       Let us pay homage to the thousands of people by whose toil and\nsacrifice and martyrdom, India became free. Let us hear once again the\nancient voice of India, and at the same time pay heed to the new voice of\nthe modern age too. The voice of our ancestors is ringing in our ears.\n      A year from now we shall be celebrating a great event in this country\nand the world. Next year it will be 2500 years since the death of Gautama\nBuddha, one of the greatest souls of India. This anniversary will be\ncelebrated all over the world. On this occasion we must remember once\nagain the principles and ideals that this great Indian gave to this country.\nWe must also remember the Father of the Nation, Mahatma Gandhi, who\nlived and toiled in our own lifetime. India owes her present greatness to him\nand the path shown by him. If we follow those principles our steps will be\nfirm and we shall be stout-hearted and straightforward. Let us think about\nall this and march ahead. Jai Hind. Please say Jai Hind with me thrice."},{"year":1954,"pm":"Jawaharlal Nehru","party":"INC","title":"The Meaning of Freedom","footnote":"Speech at a public meeting on Independence Day, Red Fort, New Delhi, 15 August 1954.

It has been seven years since this new India\nwas born, seven years since we became free. We celebrate this\nanniversary every year under the ramparts of Red Fort because on this\nday, for all of us, the hundreds and thousands of us in India, life took a new\nturn and a fresh chapter of Indian history began. Now in these seven years,\nwhat has the young, seven-year old India achieved? How has it\nprogressed? Which way is it headed? Where will it go? These are big\nquestions before us. If you search your hearts, you will see that there is a\nnew life in India and a new confidence in itself, and a wave of electric\nexcitement has spread through the hundreds and lakhs of villages in India.\nThe sleeping millions have awakened, and other people, who are\ncontinuing to do their old jobs, have turned in a new direction with their\nbodies, hearts and minds. So this is the atmosphere in India today, I know\nand you know that we face many difficulties and many of our brethren are\nin dire straits. But all of us know that you and I are travelling on a new road\ntogether.\n       It was seven years ago that we became independent but what is the\nmeaning of that independence? It is not the ultimate goal of our journey.\nWe cannot sit back just because we have become independent. Our\njourney has not ended because we have achieved Independence. That is\nmerely the first step in a country's journey towards progress. Independence\nfor a country is never a completion, it has to be carried forward. A nation\nwhich is alive never stops, it has to go forward. Our country became fully\nindependent politically, though there are one or two pockets still to achieve\nfreedom. But India is quite determined that they will do so. Whatever India\ndecides to do, her millions will definitely accomplish it.\n      When I say that we cannot stop with India's Independence, what\ndoes it mean? It means that Independence does not imply mere political\nindependence. Independence and freedom have other meanings too.\nThere is social freedom, economic freedom to achieve. If there is poverty in\na country, freedom does not reach the people. Those who are caught in the\nnet of poverty cannot really be free. We have to free them. Similarly, if we\nare divided by inner quarrels and factions and build up walls of hatred\ninstead of living in harmony and amity, then, too, we cannot really be\nconsidered free.\n      If India is to be really free, we have to do many things. We have to\neradicate unemployment and poverty. Please remember that those walls\nwhich have been built up in the name of religion, caste and province and\nwhich create tensions, show that our minds and hearts are not truly free,\nhowever much the outer form may have changed. It also shows our\nnarrow-mindedness. If there is even one village in India where an Indian --\nto whatever caste he may belong, let us say, a Harijan, an untouchable --\nfaces restrictions on living and eating, drinking, etc, that village is not free; it\nis actually in bondage. We have to free every single person in this country.\nThe freedom of a country does not mean the well-being of a few, a\ncountry's freedom has to be seen from the point of view of the common\nman's living conditions, his difficulties and the opportunities of progress\navailable to him.\n      So we are still on the road to Independence. Please do not think we\nhave reached our goal. That goal is ahead of us because we are a strong\nand dynamic nation, set on the path of progress. We will progress. The\nworld has to progress. In recent years, changes have come about in our\ncountry, we have been reborn. Similarly, revolutionary changes are taking\nplace all over the world. There are various kinds of disparities and all sorts\nof changes are continually taking place. In these years, all manners of\nevents have been taking place in this great continent of Asia. For hundreds\nof years, it had been dominated by foreign powers. Foreign domination has\ncome to an end in some places but, to some extent, it still remains.\nCompare this with what happened in India and Burma. Seven years ago,\nIndia and Burma became independent and these issues were solved in a\nfriendly way when the foreign power went away from here. We had no\nenmity either with the British or with their army or their people. Our fight\nwas with the British rule in India. When that was removed, we no longer\nhad any quarrel with them. In fact we became friends. Foreign rule existed\nin many other countries of Asia and elsewhere. But they did not take this\nsensible step. What was the result? Seven years of fighting, seven years of\nruination of hundreds of thousands of people. Nations were ruined, in Asia\nand in Europe, and the world reached the brink of a large-scale war. So\nyou can see what evils can result if the natural flow of events is stopped.\nThis did not happen in India because good sense prevailed. What was\ninevitable was accepted here and so India has progressed and so has the\nworld. Burma became independent and helped towards world peace. There\nwas delay and obstruction in other countries. Please remember that in\nIndonesia too, foreign rule was removed but after much fighting. Look at\nthe difficulties the foreign powers had to face wherever they forcibly stayed\non. The reason is that the time has gone when one country can hope to\nrule over another by force. For good or for bad, it has passed. Those who\nwant to hold on to it understand neither the world nor the Asian mind.\n       Some of the questions which are arising before us today are actually\nold ones. One of these concerns small bits of territories of India, the size of\na few villages, which are still under political domination. But even a small\nsplinter in the body gives a great deal of pain. This problem should have\nbeen solved a long time ago. But we adopted peaceful methods. We tried\nto solve the problem by negotiations. I feel that the problem relating to\nFrench possessions will be solved soon. Some difficulties have arisen in\nthe case of Portuguese possessions. But assuredly these problems will\nalso be solved. As you all know, we have to continue to follow certain\nprinciples, which we adopted in order to achieve Independence. And you\nmust remember that that is how we have maintained our Independence. As\nyou know, we must work together according to the principles of\nnon-violence. I do not say that I or you have succeeded fully in following\nthese principles always. We are all weak, we falter and may fall. We can\nnever follow that path successfully all the time. But we have to remember\nthat, as a principle, it is very sound and our country will gain in stature and\nstrength to the extent we succeed in working in accordance with these\nprinciples courageously and bravely and not like cowards. We shall also\nsucceed to that extent in serving our people and the cause of world peace.\n       We have tried to experiment with this principle on the world stage\nbecause now that we are independent, whether we like it or not, we Indians\nare going to have a role to play in world affairs. The eyes of the world are\non us. India is an ancient country, which has seen many ups and downs\nand which has been a slave country for the last two or three hundred years.\nAfter all, what has the country learnt from its 200 or 250 years of bondage?\nWhat will she do now? Which way will she lean? Because when nearly four\nhundred million lean one way, it is bound to have some effect on the world.\nAfter all, we are about one fifth of the world population. So the world looks\nat us and we have tried to serve the world. The first service that we can do\nto the world is to pull ourselves together, serve our country and make her\nstrong and rich. The second thing that we can do for the world is to throw\nour weight on the side of peace and try to stop wars from taking place. It is\nobvious that ours is not a mighty country, militarily strong. There are many\npowers in the world which have great armies, air forces and unlimited\nwealth. How can we hope to compete with them? We are newcomers in the\nfield. We have to put our own house in order. So what can we do? But we\nrepresent a principle, an effort, and behind that is the guiding spirit of a\ngreat man, Mahatma Gandhi. We have learned to walk with faltering steps\non that path. Sometimes we stumbled and fell. But we kept going, keeping\nthat principle, that ideal, before us and we have tried to introduce it to the\nworld without waging a war with any country.\n       As you know, less than four years ago, some countries which were at\nwar among themselves and would not sit down to talk things over\npeacefully, suddenly thought of India as a mediator. Both sides put their\nfaith in India. Our forces went out as they had done quite often in olden\ntimes too but this time on a different mission. Then they used to go and\nfight with other countries. But, now, that time is past. We do not wish to\nfight with anyone under any circumstances. We shall not fight unless we\nare compelled to. Our forces went out but not to fight. They went out under\nthe banner of our beautiful flag in the name of peace to serve others. They\nwent to Korea. Then, as you know, we received yet another invitation from\nthe big powers to mediate in Indo-China. Again, we have accepted it,\nthough it is a very big task and a great burden involving a lot of difficulties.\nBut we could not refuse because it was an opportunity to work for world\npeace. So we accepted. We are represented by our ambassadors there\njust now. Besides us, there are two other countries on the Commission,\nnamely, Canada and Poland. All three of us will work together. Our people\nhave gone there and accepted the mantle of peace. We may have to send\nmore people soon for this task — some from the army and others. It is a big\ntask. So you can see how India is making a name for herself in the world by\nworking for peace and friendship, and not for destruction and war. I know\nthat India and Indians have always been known for friendship and peace\nand love.\n       We may make a name for ourselves in the world. But what should we\ndo at home? Our strength or weakness depends on our conduct at home. If\nwe follow these principles at home, then we shall be honoured in the world.\nAnd if we do not, all our talk is in vain. So we have to apply at home the\nprinciples of mutual cooperation and friendship. We have to work together\neven if there are hundreds of religious beliefs. If anyone belonging to a\nparticular religion thinks that he has an exclusive right over India and no\none else, we shall disown him. It would mean that he has failed to\nunderstand the principle on which Indian nationalism and Indian\nIndependence are based. In fact, in a sense, he becomes an enemy of our\nIndependence. He deals a blow to our Independence, which will be\nshattered because the basis of India's Independence is secularism. People\nbelonging to different religious sects and castes of India have to live\ntogether in amity. They should respect one another and show consideration\nfor others. We have different castes thinking of themselves as higher or\nlower than others in our country—which has created many barriers and\ntensions, and given us a bad name and weakened us. We have to combat\nthis casteism until we succeed in eradicating it completely from our country.\nWe can give no quarter to it. What it did in the olden times was deplorable.\nThere is no longer any place for it in modern times. And whoever regards it\nwith the slightest sympathy or acquiescence, is a coward, and he does not\nunderstand the message that India is trying to convey. The message of\nIndia today is that everyone in India is politically equal and has to become\nsocially equal and, as far as possible, economically equal as well. All this\ndisparity, whether it be of wealth or of social standing, is not good. Only in\nthis way can we serve our country, make it strong and carry it forward on\nthe road to progress, and, thus, armed with a new strength, we can serve\nthe world too.\n       We shall make a new India. A new India is, in fact, being created.\nYou have seen how the work put in in the last few years has slowly taken\neffect this year. You have seen how our food problem has been solved —\nthe prices of foodgrains have gone down and production has increased. As\nyou have also seen, production in factories is increasing. Ultimately, if the\npoverty in India is to be eradicated, it can only be done by increasing\nproduction. Wealth does not mean gold or silver. They are for only traders\nand businessmen to play about with. The wealth of a country is what it\nproduces from land, from factories and cottage industries — in short,\nthrough human labour. We have to produce that kind of wealth. As we have\nproduced more from land, we have been able to solve the problem of food.\nThe factories are increasing their production and new factories will be\ncoming up. And you might have seen that the big river valley projects like\nBhakra-Nangal are nearing completion, and the people will now benefit\nfrom them. In this way, 36 crore people are going ahead. If you go to the\nvillages, you will see all kinds of projects going on and we have to spread\nthem throughout India. It has been decided to spread them among a few\nmillion people every year. Our aim is that every village in India should come\nunder this scheme within the next seven years. There are six hundred\nthousand villages in India. So our goal is not a small one. And our country\nis not a small one. We have to take big steps, undertake great tasks, win\nbig victories. But our victories will not be over others, neither do we wish to\nsuppress anyone. Our victories will mean the victory of others too. This is\nIndia's policy internally and in our external affairs too.\n      Why is it that India is today among the very few countries whose\ndoors are open to everyone? We invite the people of all countries to come\nhere. We have no enmity with anyone. Our brothers in Pakistan are often\nangry and unhappy with us. All sorts of problems came between us. But, as\nI have repeatedly said, we harbour no thoughts of war. We want to love\nthem and cooperate with them, because we understand that such close\nneighbours as India and Pakistan should live in amity with each other.\nNeither benefits from losses suffered by the other. We should move with\nthis approach. That does not mean that we should give up our principles or\nlet our prestige suffer out of fear. We have to stand firmly by our principles\nand remember that we are pursuing the path of peace, not of war.\n        I referred to you just now to the areas which are in India but have still\nnot got Independence. Goa is one of them. Even there, our policy has been\none of peace. But I would like to tell you that Goa is a test for us and you\ncan say it is a test for the Portuguese, though it is difficult for a nation which\nspeaks with a language three or four hundred years old to realize this.\nWhether it is a test for the Portuguese or ourselves, it is certainly a trial for\nthe whole world. I want you to understand this. In a sense, I would say it\nhas become a testing ground to see which side the nations of the world\nlean when it is a question of one country ruling over another that is, of\ncolonialism, or whatever you may call it. Goa cannot radically change\nIndia's fortunes by becoming part of her, nor will Portugal be enriched by\nretaining Goa. But it is like the scar of an old boil, of one country ruling over\nanother. How can any one say that it is an old boil and so we must put up\nwith the pain? They do not understand our mind or that of Asia. And so this\nis a trial for the other countries. We do not want any country to intervene in\nthe solution of the problem or extend help in this matter. But we want to\nprobe their minds to see what they are thinking, which way they are leaning\nand what their advice would be, though it is a strange way of measuring\nthings. Their minds are old-fashioned. Today's world is a new world. If the\nlight from the new world does not penetrate their minds and they continue\nto be old-fashioned, then they will definitely fall once again. I gave you an\nexample just now of how the world has gained by the fact that India\nachieved Independence and is progressing. But Independence has yet to\nbe realized in many other parts of Asia. Fighting has been going on for\nyears, bringing ruin in its wake. The world is moving at a fast pace. How\ncan anyone hope to arrest big floods? And if it is a human flood, an attempt\nto control it can only have disastrous consequences. So I feel that Goa is\nalso a test of the other countries of the world. If they give wrong advice, the\nsituation worsens. If they adopt the right course, problems can be solved in\na peaceful way.\n      I would like to remind you once again that India has embarked on a\nlong journey. People belonging to various castes and religions, like Hindus,\nMuslims, Sikhs, Christians, Buddhists and Jains, are all Indians and, in that\ncapacity, they keep marching ahead, and the country also progresses.\n       How does a nation become affluent and emerge out of its poverty?\nBy hard work. We cannot look to the stars to help us — we do not want\ntheir help. We do not want anyone's help. We have strength in our\nshoulders and our minds. We shall progress by working together in peace\nand harmony. So I invite you on this anniversary, yours and mine, of our\nIndependence for, when a country becomes independent, each one of its\ncitizens becomes independent and so your anniversary and mine — the\neighth anniversary of the Independence of new India, to participate in this\nlong journey, so that we can work hard with our full strength and uplift the\ntowns and villages of India.

We must first pay homage to the\nmemory of that soul who was responsible for making India free, who\nbreathed fresh life into a withered nation and made it almost as good as\nnew. We must think of Mahatma Gandhi before we do anything else today.\nWhat does that mean? A great man came amongst us, shone like a bright\nstar and then passed on. To think of him means refreshing our memories\nabout the lessons that he taught us. What did he teach us? We must\nremember once again the principles by which we became strong and\nultimately won freedom. If we forget those fundamental principles, we shall\nbecome weak and fail to do what we have set out to do.\n        The history of our country goes back thousands of years. India has\noccupied a very high position and has also fallen time and again. We must\nremember the things that gave us strength and those that weakened us.\nWe must think about those fundamental things and our future goal and how\nwe should try to reach it. We must also remember that that goal cannot be\nreached by wrong methods. Wrong means do not yield right results. This is\na fundamental principle which we cannot forget. We reaped the fruits of\nright action and got freedom. But at the very moment when we were\ncelebrating our victory, and I had unfurled this flag from this very spot, a\nterrible thing happened. There was a holocaust in Pakistan and in north\nIndia and millions of uprooted human beings trekked from both sides in\nsearch of refuge and shelter. We are paying the price for that terrible\ndisaster till this evil can fail to leave its traces behind just as no good can\nfail to produce good results.\n       We have to think calmly about the tremendous tasks before us — the\ntask of uplifting the thirty-six crores of Indians by making them better off\nand removing their difficulties. It is a tremendous task to build a new\ncountry out of a very ancient one. Where does our duty lie? It is obvious\nthat the most important duty is to protect our freedom. Secondly, it is\nimportant to form friendly ties with all the countries of the world and\ncooperate with them. We must not interfere in the affairs of any other\ncountry, nor should we tolerate any interference in our internal affairs. This\nis the path we must follow. The third important question is what we are\ngoing to do within the country. How are we going to make this large family\nof thirty-six crore human beings better off? Can families survive if they fight\namong themselves constantly and build barriers? We must remove the\nbarriers that separate us. We must get rid of communalism because it is a\nwall that keeps us in separate compartments and weakens us. It breaks up\nthe large Indian family into segments and fosters enmity between brothers.\nWe must get rid of provincialism because if we put our province before the\ncountry, we shall slip back. We must put our country before everything else\nand remember that if India progresses, all of us will progress too and if she\nremains backward, no one in the country can go ahead, even if a district or\na province might make some progress. Another thing which keeps us in\nseparate compartments and weakens us is the ancient vice of casteism, for\nit encourages people to put their own narrow caste before their country.\n      There are tremendous tasks before us, the task of economic\nreconstruction, and of making the condition of people in India better by\nputting an end to unemployment and poverty. Ultimately, the strength of a\ncountry lies not in idle talk and building castles in the air, but in its\neconomic conditions and in the character of the people and their unity. We\nhave got political freedom but it is incomplete. It will be complete only when\nwe solve our economic problems and freedom is within the reach of every\nsingle Indian. This is the most urgent task in which we are engaged at\npresent, of removing poverty and unemployment from the country, so that\nevery man and woman in India may produce wealth for themselves as well\nas for the country and thus increase our strength. These are the big tasks\nbefore us.\n      As far as world affairs are concerned, we must make efforts to\nestablish peace in the world and prevent wars. We are striving towards this.\nWe do not wish to get involved in world affairs for we want to set our own\norder first. But we have done what little we could and our efforts have been\nappreciated and, at the same time, our responsibilities have increased. As\nyou know, we are sending some of our troops to Korea. Why are these\nforces being sent? In the past, forces used to be sent out to fight in other\ncountries, but our forces are going out not for war but for peace. Our forces\nare going at the invitation of other countries who are fighting with one\nanother. They are agreed upon one thing and that is to invite our forces to\ncome and do their duty. We do not wish to take on the additional\nresponsibilities of the world but there are some duties which we cannot\nevade. So our forces are going to Korea. There is a talk of peace again in\nthe world and to make an effort to change the atmosphere in the world\naway from war. Those efforts are being made but it is my regret that some\npeople are still speaking the language of threats and aggrandisement. If we\nwant peace in the world, it cannot be done by threatening one another or\nstriking fear in others' hearts but by extending a firm hand of friendship. So\nthe talk of peace is welcome and it would be better if some nations which\nare involved also change their thinking a little. Mere talk of peace cannot\nhelp unless there is a change of outlook.\n        So we are trying to discharge our duties abroad and at home\nestablishing peace and improving the economic condition in the country.\nBig tasks have been accomplished in the last six years and I think that\nwhen history is written, all that has happened in this period will find mention\nin it. But at the same time it is also true that many of the things which we\nwished to do could not be done. The task is gigantic and the workers seem\nvery few but if everyone pulls his weight the burden will be lighter.\n      A week ago, there were some incidents in Kashmir which caused our\nneighbour, Pakistan, much anxiety. I do not wish to say much about those\nincidents, because this is not the proper occasion. But I do wish to tell you\nthat you must not pay heed to rumours and be constantly vigilant. I am\namazed at the false news and rumours being published in Pakistani\nnewspapers during the last few days about Kashmir and what our forces\nare supposed to have done or not done there. I wish to say very forcefully\nthat our forces had no hand in those incidents. What is the meaning of\nspreading such rumours in Pakistan and in some other countries by\njournalists? It is absurd and absolutely wrong to spread rumours and\nunnecessarily to incite people and foment bitterness between the countries.\nIt is an internal matter of Kashmir. I am sorry about the recent incidents\nbecause it is always a matter of regret when there is a parting of ways\nbetween old friends and colleagues and I can tell you that it is not proper to\ntalk ill of others on such occasions. If we do so, it is bound to boomerang\non us. We are unhappy, but sometimes whatever our feelings may be, we\nhave to do our duty with dignity and by the right means, always keeping in\nmind our fundamental principles. As I said, many things that have\nhappened in Kashmir have made us unhappy. There is a story behind it\nand there have been other incidents elsewhere which have incited the\npeople of Kashmir to some extent, like the communal incidents which\noccurred in Delhi and the Punjab. It is strange that they have succeeded in\ndoing just the opposite of what they had wished to do. So you can see how\nbring about undesirable results, even if your intentions are pure.\n      I was talking about Kashmir. I want to repeat what I had said earlier,\nthat we shall stick by the promise made five and a half years ago that the\nfate of Kashmir will be decided by the people of Kashmir. This is absolutely\ncertain even today and there will be no interference or coercion on our part.\nThe second thing is that a new Government was formed in Kashmir last\nweek, but it is obvious that it can last only so long as they represent the\npeople of Kashmir and are accepted by the elected Assembly. Otherwise\nanother Government will have to be formed. Our principles apply equally all\nover India as well as in Kashmir.\n      So these incidents occurred in Kashmir and I can understand that\nthey may have caused you some surprise for you were not fully aware of\nthe past history. But it has been blown out of all proportion and all sorts of\nrumours were spread which increased the panic among the people, and in\nother nations, especially our neighbour, Pakistan, where there was a\nstrange hostility and anger. Views were expressed on this issue which have\nno relationship with reality. I am not here to criticize anyone but to express\nmy sorrow that we should be so easily led astray and incited. This is not the\nway to solve major problems. I want to warn you that there are bound to be\nmajor issues and crises in India and the world and we shall be put to test.\nThe question is whether we can think and act calmly and peacefully or rush\naround here and there in a blind panic. A nation is tested in this way and\nthe more insurmountable the problems, the calmer we ought to be and act\npeacefully and wisely. When we have accepted the fundamental principle\nthat the people of Kashmir will decide for themselves, there is no room for\nargument. We can certainly discuss the means by which this is to be done.\nBut there can be no argument about principles. We have said this\nrepeatedly ever since the Kashmir issue came up before us. We have also\nmaintained that Kashmir has a special status. When it agreed to join India,\nwe welcomed it. But even then, we have given it a special status owing to\ngeographical and various other reasons. If people make a noise after all\nthis and demand that Kashmir should have equal status with other States,\nthey have obviously failed to understand the circumstances and the real\nsituation. They can see that it has had just the opposite result.\n       I referred to Pakistan. I went to Pakistan a few days ago at the\ninvitation of their Government and the people welcomed me with great\naffection. It had a powerful influence on me, especially the love of the\npeople which was very similar to what you might find in any part of India. I\nfound the same thing in Karachi and realized that after all I was not in any\nforeign country and there was not much difference between our country\nand theirs. I saw many familiar faces there, of old friends and colleagues\nand people who had gone away from India. The picture was the same,\nexcept for a few differences. In short, I did not feel for a moment that I was\nin some foreign country. This is the picture just now and it is possible that it\nmay change if the people's attitude changes through some\nmisunderstanding. So you can see from this how people's behaviour\ndepends on the way they are treated. I want that we should not budge from\nour principles and ideals but follow the right path of friendship with all\ncountries, even with Pakistan, and if there is any misunderstanding, it will\nbe cleared up in due course. If there is constant tension and bitterness\nbetween our countries, it cannot be good for either India or Pakistan. Fear\ncan never yield good results and so we must not live in constant fear. The\nPrime Minister of Pakistan is coming here at our invitation just as I went to\nKarachi at their invitation. I want that the citizens of this ancient and historic\ncity of Delhi should give him a grand welcome and show our\nlarge-heartedness and goodwill. It is possible that during his stay here,\nthere may be a reception for him from this very Red Fort and in other\nplaces too.\n       So I want that all of us as a nation must remember the principles and\nideals of Mahatma Gandhi on this day. We must think of our success but\nmore so of our failures and the moments when we slipped in the last five or\nsix years, because we have a lesson to learn from them. Let us once again\ntake a pledge under this beloved flag of ours that we shall serve our\ncountry and promote unity among the people of various religions because\neveryone has an equal share in India's freedom. We must get rid of the\nbarriers of provincialism, casteism and communalism and make the country\nstrong. We must harness all our strength towards building a new India and\nnot fritter it away in futile quarrels. We must also pledge that we shall try to\nestablish peace in the world and extend a hand of friendship to all\ncountries. We have to fight one battle, which we shall with all our might,\nand that battle is against the poverty of India. It is likely to be a long-drawn\nout battle and will require a great deal of hard work and sweat and tears.\nBut it is worthwhile cause to uplift the millions of Indians and make them\nbetter off. This is no small task. This is our goal and we cannot rest till we\nreach it. You must remember these principles and go ahead. The life of a\nnation goes on, it is never-ending, and one goal follows another. We may\ncome and go, but India is everlasting. Our only desire is that in the time that\nis given to us, we should also serve her a little and then pass on the mantle\nto the succeeding generations so that they may also share the memories of\nthe freedom struggle and the hardships and sacrifices which had gone into\nthe making of a new India.\n      Please say Jai Hind with me three times.

Five years ago, on this day, we had assembled at this spot\nin the old city of Delhi and unfurled the flag of freedom from the ramparts of\nthe Red Fort. It heralded the beginning of a new chapter in Indian history.\nFive years have gone by since then. There have been big ups and downs\nin this period. We have been able to achieve something, but a great deal\nstill remains to be done.\n      We, the millions in India, became heirs to a great heritage five years\nago, the heritage of this vast country which spreads from the Himalayas to\nKanyakumari. But it is something more than that, for India's history dates\nback to thousands of years. We became heirs to thousands of years of\nhistory and grandeur and ups and downs which India has witnessed in\npast.\n       Where does our duty lie? How are we to mould the history of India\nand contribute to her vast heritage for the generations to come? Five years\nis not a very long period in the history of a nation. But these five years have\nbeen momentous in the history of the world and of India. We have had to\nface big problems. It is now for the historians to give their verdict about our\nachievements and failures. We should not keep harking back to the past,\nbut look forward to the future. Duty calls, and the tasks left incomplete are\nconstantly with us.\n       The tasks of a nation are, of course, never ending. There are millions\nof things waiting to be done and the process will never end. We can\nmeasure our achievements by the number of new buildings and schools\nand other constructions that have been completed. But the real yardstick to\nmeasure the worth of our work is to see to what extent we have succeeded\nin wiping the tears from the eyes of the poor who continue to be in misery.\nThat is the real yardstick of India's progress, not the construction of\nbuildings and grand projects that we have undertaken.\n     India is not a mere geographical expression extending from the\nHimalayas to Kanyakumari. India is a nation of thirty six crores of men,\nwomen, and children. The welfare of India lies in the welfare of these thirty\nsix crores of people. Our time is nearly over. We have discharged our duty\nto the best of our ability, and now it is the younger people who must\nassume responsibility. So long as there was strength in us we carried the\ntorch of freedom without faltering and never letting it fall. Now, the millions\nof young boys and girls in India have to carry on the task after us with\nhonour and pride, and serve the country, and work for her progress, and\nabove all, to find a way to wipe the tears of millions of people who are in\ngreat need. The most important task before us is to ensure that the millions\nof children in the country get the basic necessities of life, the opportunity for\neducation, and proper physical and mental development, so that they can\ngrow up and take on the burdens of this great country.\n        This is a challenging task. It cannot be done by merely passing laws\nor issuing edicts. The Government is certainly responsible for the people,\nbut it cannot discharge its responsibility until the people of the country\ncooperate wholeheartedly and willingly. It is indeed a gigantic task, and this\ncannot be accomplished by the Government alone without the participation\nof all the people. There may be differences of opinion on political, social\nand economic issues. But basically our tasks can be done only by the\nmutual cooperation of all the people.\n       There are a number of issues on which there is a difference of\nopinion, and the barriers are insurmountable. What are the areas in which\nthe cooperation of all the people is essential? After all, we are all citizens of\nthis great country and, irrespective of our religion, caste, province, or\nlanguage, we owe a duty to our country. All of us are shareholders in\nIndia's freedom and, therefore, equally responsible for maintaining and\nprotecting that freedom. There are certain paths which tend to lead us\nastray, into violence and internecine quarrels in which voices are raised in\nanger against one another. It is absurd to think that such paths can lead the\ncountry to its goal of progress and development. Such thinking is born out\nof ignorance and is the surest path ruin. We must be constantly vigilant\nagainst such tendencies because, no matter how great the principle behind\nthe quarrel, the internal feud and disunity can only lead the country to ruin,\nbloodshed and violence.\n      Then there are others who fight in the name of religion. We have\nlearned the lesson of the evils of communalism in the past, and it is\nabsolutely certain that it cannot lead to progress but only to further\nweakening of the country. We will fritter away our energies in futile\nsquabbles instead of concentrating on progress. We must guard ourselves\nagainst such tendencies. Another category of people is the selfish black\nmarketeers who get rich at the expense of the poor and needy.\nThese are the factors against which we must guard ourselves. We are\ncitizens of a great nation with a glorious history behind it. The people of a\ngreat nation ought to be large-hearted and perform great deeds. They\nshould not stoop to chicanery and wrong-doing. We achieved\nindependence in a grand manner and now we must continue to uphold that\ntradition. We will hand over the torch of freedom, when our strength fails, to\nthe youth of the country. Once our duty is done, we can be thrown on the\nscrap-heap. But, so long as there is strength in our minds and body, until\nthe very last moment, we must toil for the cause of the country, in the\nservice of India's millions and strive towards progress. Once our strength\nfails, our time will be up and we need not be bothered about what happens\nto us, for others will carry on.\n      We must set about this big task from the larger angle of the whole\ncountry, and not from the viewpoint of any single province, community,\ncaste or religion. Every individual is free to follow his own religion and\noccupation. But ultimately the biggest duty, profession and religion of any\nperson today is to serve the thirty-six crores of people, to uplift the poor, the\ndowntrodden masses and to wipe out every tear from every eye of the\nsuffering people.\n     We have had to suffer great hardships in the last few years. Natural\ncalamities like drought and earthquakes had afflicted the country. Anyhow,\nwe have nearly overcome our troubles.\n     This year we have fared much better than we have done in the past.\nThere has been plenty of rainfall, and the position of food and other basic\nnecessities is better now than in previous years. Yet we must constantly\nbear in mind that India is a vast country and some areas of distress are\nlikely to be present in the country at all times. The rainfall has been good\nand food production has been above average. Yet in some districts like\nGorakhpur, Azamgarh, Deoria and Basti in Uttar Pradesh, some regions in\nBihar, and the Sundarbans area in West Bengal, Rayalaseema in the\nSouth, some districts in Mysore, Rajasthan and Saurashtra, conditions of\ngreat distress and privation prevail.\n      It is our duty to help these people in every way. Not only should we\nprovide temporary relief but make arrangements to ensure that they can\nstand on their own feet and participate in the general progress of the\ncountry. Ultimately, the thirty-six crores of people of India belong to one\nlarge family and we must march together in step and go forward to achieve\nprogress. Those who think that they can progress, while others lag behind,\nare mistaken, because the latter will drag others down with them.\nTherefore, it is imperative that the whole country must march together.\n       There are three main dangers facing the country. One is caused by\ndisunity and internal dissensions, two, by the greed and avarice of black\nmarketeers and profiteers who make money through corruption, bribery,\netc., and the third by communalism. It is strange that, in spite of the bitter\nlesson that we have learnt in the past, there are some people who indulge\nin such activities, and even take pride in running down other religions and\nmaintain that they are helping their own religion by doing so.\n       Recently, I was extremely annoyed to read about an incident in\nAllahabad, which was wholly uncivilized. It angered me that any individual\nin India could be so foolish. Yet there were some other foolish people who,\ninstead of acknowledging that it was wrong and punishing the wrongdoer,\nretaliated by saving that they would not participate in the Independence\nDay celebrations, as a protest. How can any Indian behave like this? It may\nnot be necessary that everyone should participate in the celebrations. But it\nis foolish to express anger and resentment on an auspicious day, no matter\nwhat the provocation may be. It is something which stains India's freedom\nand sullies her honour.\n       Ultimately, we all must bear in mind that we have to march together.\nIf we let ourselves drift away from our path because of the wrong action of\none, a hundred or a thousand individuals, the country will be ruined. Please\nremember what India's ancient culture and tradition teach us. You must\nbear in mind what a great Indian has said over two thousand years ago,\nand not merely said but had his sayings engraved on big stones and\ncolumns all over the country. The great emperor Asoka said that if the\nfollowers of one religion respect and tolerate other religions, they, by doing\nso, only enhance the respect of their own religion. Those who show\ndisrespect to the faith of others only degrade their own faith. This has been\nthe principle of India's culture for thousands of years, and not of bitterness,\nhatred and feuds as some people in their ignorance today imagine.\n      If you look at the world, you will find it in the grip of a psychosis.\nThere is a constant talk of war everywhere, and nobody knows when things\nmay get out of hand and the world razed to the ground. We are a weak\nnation. Yet we have raised our voice for peace. We have done so in the\npast, and we will continue to strive for peace in the world until our last\nbreath. But that is possible only when we all progress together as a nation.\n      While there is this talk of war throughout the world, there is another\nkind of war that is going on in South Africa. This has a relation in a way to\nIndia, because the method being adopted there is the method of\nsatyagraha shown by a great soul of India. The war is for the principle of\nequality of all human beings.\n      Racialism is rampant in South Africa, with the whites brutally\nsuppressing the blacks. The people of South Africa have learnt the lesson\ntaught by Mahatma Gandhi, and are peacefully opposing racial oppression.\nI am happy to know that the Indian residents of South Africa are\ncooperating fully with the Africans in their struggle. I am convinced that the\nsympathy of the people of this country will go out to the struggling people of\nSouth Africa.\n      It is through this peaceful method we won freedom, and I hope that in\nfuture too we will continue to solve our problems by peaceful means. Let us\nconstantly bear this in mind, and renew our pledge once again on this day\nto work for the progress of India, for it is imperative for our very survival.\nWe must continue to uphold the ancient tradition and culture of India and\nmake every effort to maintain peace in the world. We have on our hands\nthe urgent task of removing poverty and unemployment from the country.\nWe may not hope to complete the task in our life time, but we must do what\nwe can. After that, others will carry on.\n       I want you on this day to examine what our weaknesses are, and look\ninwards, instead of criticizing others. If everyone does his duty, the world\nwill be a far better place. We must learn the lesson of cooperation and\ndiscipline from the members of our armed forces. They are meant to\nprotect the country, and they are imbued with a sense of discipline. Men\nfrom all States and from all religions join the army, navy and air force and\nwork together in harmony and cooperation. They do not fight among\nthemselves. Our armed forces symbolize courage and unity. We must\nemulate the same sense of discipline and teamwork. We must not fight\namong ourselves but work with the firm intention of accomplishing the big\ntasks which confront us, of becoming self-reliant instead of depending on\nthe Government for everything. Only then can India progress."},{"year":1951,"pm":"Jawaharlal Nehru","party":"INC","title":"For a Concerted Effort to End Poverty","footnote":"Speech from the ramparts of the Red Fort, New Delhi, on Independence Day, 15 August From National Herald, 17 August 1951.","source":"Selected works of Jawaharlal Nehru.

Yet it is\ntrue that the last four years seem to be an age so far as India is concerned.\nVital experiences the Indian people have passed through have apparently\nlengthened the span of these years considerably.\n      I sometimes wonder what would have happened had the people of\nIndia not passed through the trials and tribulations which had fallen to their\nlot during the past four years.\n      Even today, when times are hard, many people are prone to be\ncareless. ease-loving and selfish, much to the detriment of the nation.\nNaturally, I fear to imagine that if the times were not so difficult, perhaps the\nwhole nation might have fallen a prey to carelessness and selfishness.\nNothing can be more dangerous and deplorable than that a nation should\nbecome careless and forget its ideals.\n      What was that power which inspired us in our fight for freedom? That\npower was the strength of our minds, of the hearts of millions of ordinary\nmen whom Mahatma Gandhi had taught not to be afraid even of the\nmightiest imperialist power. If that strength of heart and mind was lacking,\nthen no other power could save the country.\n       It is, therefore, proper that on this anniversary day of nation's\nfreedom, the people should look back and ponder over what had increased\ntheir strength and had helped them in winning freedom. At the same time,\nthey should pledge to avoid all those pitfalls which had weakened India in\nthe past and made her the slave of others.\n      Unfortunately, many people believe that after independence their\nwork has been completed. This attitude is utterly wrong because, for the\nmaintenance of independence, eternal vigilance is necessary and\nwhosoever is not vigilant is bound to go under in the harsh merciless world\nof today.\n      I am proud of the Indian Army, Navy and Air Force which are manned\nby brave young men who can be depended upon to protect the country.\nBut, a country can ultimately be defended only by its people and not by\narmies alone. The security of the country depends on whether the people\nare brave or not, and whether they entangle themselves in minor conflicts\nor care for big things.\n      There is great need for hard work. A country whose people shirk work\nis bound to be weakened. Along with hard work, united action is necessary.\nPeople must remember that we are all sailing in the same boat. We have,\ntherefore, to sink or swim together. If the country goes ahead, all are bound\nto be benefited. But if, unfortunately, it goes under, nobody will be able to\nescape his doom.\n       Some foolish people may try to disturb national unity either out of\nsheer stupidity or because of their calculated move to weaken the country. I\nhave heard that some persons tried to create some trouble in the city of\nDelhi this morning or last night. It is the bounden duty of the people to\nfrustrate each and every move of such foolish people.\n       People are facing the problems of rising prices, black marketing and\nother such difficulties. These problems are created by two factors, first,\nthose which are out of our control, like the Korean war, and secondly, those\nwhich can be controlled by us. The black market is of the latter category\nand any government should try to curb it with an iron hand. Perhaps, in the\npast that vice had not been combated as effectively as it ought to have\nbeen. But then it was not merely the responsibility of the Government to do\nthat. People also had to cooperate with the Government and both had to\nfind a way out of the mess.\n       The success of the five-year plan depends upon the measure of\npeople's support. Many people have suggested that we should get foreign\naid in order to push through national projects. Foreign aid is welcome if no\nstrings are attached to it. But the people must realise that we cannot go on\nlooking towards outsiders for help.\n      Moreover, silver and gold alone, howsoever important they are, do\nnot constitute by themselves the wealth of a nation. In fact, the real wealth\nof a nation is the hard work of its people. Government help may be there,\nbut the work has to be done by the people. For instance, China is making\nrapid progress because its people are working hard. Each village there is\ncompeting in a friendly manner with every other village to construct and\nproduce more and more, and naturally great results are being produced.\nThe United States of America is another example worth following. This\ncountry is the richest in the world because its people work hard to produce\nwealth. In India also some people in villages have built roads and public\nbuildings without depending on Government machinery which is inevitably\nslow.\n      I appeal to you not to look down upon manual work and to keep up\nthe dignity of labour. It is not proper for everyone to seek office jobs. You\nmust produce with your own hands.\n       A world war will completely destroy civilization as it exists today and\nwill take the world back to savagery. Korea ought to be a lesson to those\nwho talk glibly of war. That unfortunate country has been almost completely\ndevastated by a war between two great powers. People claim that they\nhave gone to Korea to liberate it. I am afraid that soon there might not be\nleft any Korean to need liberation.\n      That is why India has consistently followed a policy for world peace\nand particularly for peace with its neighbour, Pakistan. It has to be\nunderstood that partition has been brought about by mutual agreement and\nhas to be accepted. Therefore, all talk of its annulment is wrong, and does\nno good to anybody.\n      War drums are being beaten in Pakistan and there is a cry for jehad.\nIndia has naturally taken precautionary measures, for the defence of the\ncountry is our primary responsibility. At the same time we have made it\nclear that we want no war with anybody, much less with Pakistan.\n      I am grateful to the people of India who have remained perfectly calm\ndespite sabre-rattling on the other side of the border. Even in our border\nareas people are carrying on their normal vocations unruffled. This is a sign\nof our strength and our peaceful intentions.\n      I want to tell the people of Pakistan and the whole world that there is\nno reason why the bonds which had tied the people of India and Pakistan\nso long should now be broken. Why should the two countries waste their\nstrength in mutual conflict?\n     I urge the people of India not to bear any ill will towards the people of\nPakistan. There are good people and bad people on both sides. If some\npeople in Pakistan do something wrong, it does not mean that we should\nconsider the whole nation as our enemy."},{"year":1950,"pm":"Jawaharlal Nehru","party":"INC","title":"Unity and Equality","footnote":"Speech from the Red Fort, Delhi, on Independence Day, 15 August 1950, AIR tapes, N.M.M.L.

I congratulate you on this auspicious occasion. We have come a\nlong way during these three years. We have stumbled and fallen but have\npicked ourselves up and gone on. I congratulate you for everything that has\nhappened, good and bad, during these years. Why do I include the bad?\nPerhaps that is wrong. But what I mean is that you are to be congratulated\nfor the joys as well as the sorrows that these three years have brought.\nNations grow with the joys as well as the sorrows and troubles that come\ntheir way. When long years go by without a nation being tested it becomes\nslack and weak. We have been through gruelling tests during the last three\nyears, and also in the years which preceded independence. We gained\nindependence by passing those tests with flying colours. Now the nation\nfaces even greater challenges and we shall succeed to the extent that we\nsucceed in facing them with courage and confidence. You should accept\nthe good and the bad, happiness and sorrow, as they come. What you\nmust guard against, however, is cowardice, narrow-mindedness and\ndisunity because they weaken the nation and pave the way for its downfall\nby debilitating its strength to protect its freedom.\n        We have been able to reach many of our goals in the last three years.\nOn the 26th of January this year, we saw a big dream of ours come true.\nThere are many other dreams which still remain unfulfilled. Within a few\nmonths, millions of people will be going to the polls to elect a new\ngovernment and the new Constitution which we have adopted will bear\nfruit. In this way, we are inching forward step by step, no doubt with\ndifficulty, bearing many hardships. But we are going ahead anyway.\n       Look at the world around you and the troubles that other countries\nare facing. There is once again talk of war. Then you come to India where,\nin spite of our weaknesses and evils, we are gradually making progress. It\nis against the backdrop of the world situation that we must try to\nunderstand India, bearing in mind where our duty lies at a time when the\nwhole world is in turmoil. We cannot look to others to help us out of our\ndifficulties, for if we did, we would become weak. We fought for our\nfreedom by relying not on others or on any weapons but on ourselves and\nour courage and so we succeeded. Similarly, we can overcome the\ndangers that threaten us only by relying on ourselves. We do not want\nenmity with anyone. We want to be friends with all nations. But ultimately\nwe have to rely on our own strength.\n       Freedom of thought and of expression is an essential prerequisite of\na free country. People should be free to form different parties and express\ntheir political views. Without this freedom a country cannot remain free. But,\nat the same time you should beware of people who work against our\nfreedom or do something by which that freedom is shaken or weakened.\nFreedom of thought and expression must prevail but always with the\nproviso that it does not weaken the country's unity or independence. If that\nhappens, it is a betrayal of the country. People often fail to make this\ndistinction. Freedom does not give the right to anyone to do evil. Freedom\nof expression does not mean the freedom to abuse others in the street or\nprint obscenities in newspapers. Such things will vitiate our entire life.\nFreedom particularly does not mean a right to strike at the roots of that\nfreedom. If someone attempts such a thing, it is obvious that we have to\nprevent it. There are many people in the country today who have fomented\ntrouble and incited people in the name of freedom and tried to weaken the\nnation. They have been dealt with, and since India is strong in spite of our\nweaknesses, we have succeeded and continue to progress. Some people\nhave made a declaration that they would not participate in the\nIndependence Day celebrations. Some others went a step further and said\nthey would obstruct the proceedings. You can imagine the kind of mentality\nwhich prompts such thinking and emotions. This has nothing to do with\nfreedom of expression or thought. It is an outright onslaught on India's\nfreedom and, no matter who they are or to which party they belong, we\nhave to fight against them and root them out completely.\n      What is the meaning of all this? There are people in the country who\nare always fomenting disunity and trouble in the land. Their constant cry\nseems to be that the freedom they have is not enough; and so they want to\nbreak up even what they have. This is indeed strange, and indicates\nstupidity or some strange quirk of emotion. How can anyone behave in this\nmanner when we are living at a crucial time in the history of India and of the\nworld? If we Indians have differences of opinion, we may quarrel among\nourselves, but when the question of India arises, it is the duty of all Indians\nto bury their mutual differences and to remember that our loyalty is to the\ncountry. Those who do not accept this are not Indians. They are welcome\nto go and live elsewhere.\n       What brought us together in the past was the unity of India despite\nvarious diversities of religion, caste, province and region. Now I find that\nsome parties are once again raising their voices in favour of communalism\nand fostering fissiparous tendencies in the country. They invoke the name\nof religion for purely political purposes. You can imagine whether\ncommunalism and provincialism will weaken the country or strengthen it.\nPeople are welcome to hold different views and to give free expression to\nthem. I do not want everyone in India to repeat the same thing like parrots\nas though they had no power to think for themselves. We have every right\nto express our views. But no Indian has the right to raise his voice against\nIndia's freedom or to do something which weakens her unity. Those who\nindulge in such things, whether they understand it or not, are traitors. We\nmust understand these fundamental truths for we are living at a delicate\nmoment in history and we cannot progress unless our freedom is secure.\n       As you know, there are many problems before us. The world is in a\nstrange flux today. War is going on in a part of Asia, and though Korea is a\nsmall country, it is a terrible war. Nobody knows how long it will last,\nwhether it will remain limited there or engulf the world. We are making all\nefforts to end it soon, but our efforts cannot succeed all over the world.\nNobody knows what might happen. But we can do one thing at least: if we\ncan set our own house in order and keep the country on an even keel, give\nher a proper direction, we can keep India safe even if there is a world\nconflagration. We can even help to save the world if we have the strength\nand the spirit and if we are united.\n      Many problems are before us today, the biggest being that of food.\nEveryone needs to eat. We have made tremendous efforts during the last\ntwo to three years to solve this problem. As you know, there is food\nshortage even now in Madras, Bihar and some other States. The reports\nthat come in are heart-rending. The situation is still pretty serious. But it has\nbeen blown out of all proportion and that is even more serious.\n       So our first priority is to solve the food problem. Due to various\nreasons enough food is not produced in India. Many factors are responsible\nfor that: the war, partition with the creation of Pakistan, large\nfood-producing areas have been lost to us and our population has\nincreased. A country, particularly a large country like ours which does not\nproduce enough food, becomes dependent on others. We have to spend\nenormous amounts of foreign exchange on importing food. But the most\nimportant thing is that it weakens us and leaves us vulnerable to outside\npressures which may threaten our freedom.\n       If, unfortunately, there is a world war, we would not be able to import\nfoodgrains at all. How will we manage then? It is obvious that we have to\nbecome self-sufficient in food. Secondly, we must change our food habits.\nIf a certain type of food is available, we should be ready to eat it. We must\nlearn to eat whatever is available, particularly if import of foodgrains\nbecomes impossible. We must try to produce enough foodgrains in the\ncountry. We must not waste even the smallest quantity of food. We have\nbeen thinking of ways and means of doing so. I want you to understand\nthat we will stick to what we said about stopping all import of foodgrains\nand becoming self-sufficient in two years. Even if there are some\nshortages, we shall have to put up with that. This is our policy and\nprogramme and we will stick to it despite difficulties.\n      You will find that the situation on the food front is rather strange. On\nthe one hand, there is no doubt that we are succeeding in our drive to\nproduce more food and we shall grow more in the next year or two. But at\nthe same time, we have had natural calamities like floods and drought in\ncertain areas such as Madras. Bihar and Saurashtra. We do not have\nenough food stocks in the country to tide us over these crises. Even so we\nhave sent supplies to the worst affected areas. There may be problems in\nsupplying foodgrains to all the villages. But there is sufficient food in every\nState for the next two or three months. So there is no cause for alarm. It is\ntrue that any problem of this kind is a sign of inefficiency in our\nadministration either in the States or at the Centre. I accept that. We must\nnot try to evade our responsibility but learn a lesson.\n       The other thing, which is more serious, is that there are many people\nin India who have no scruples in making profits out of other people's\ndistress. Traders and shopkeepers hoard foodgrains in order to make a\nprofit later. I cannot understand this mentality which prompts people to\ncash in on adversity. How can we tolerate that? You will say that all this is\nmere talk and that Jawaharlal had said three years ago that black\nmarketeers would be severely punished, but that nothing has been done.\nYou would be justified in saying this. I am myself ashamed that we should\nhave become so callous as to allow black marketeers to flourish. It\nhappens openly in Delhi and we seem helpless to do anything about it.\nWhy should anyone tolerate some people taking advantage of a shortage\nto make money, and becoming millionaires, without caring whether some\nother people are dying? It is obvious that the first duty of the Government is\nto deal with this. But no matter how many laws a government may pass,\nthey cannot be effective unless the people help and cooperate with the\ngovernment. If all of us make up our minds to put an end to black marketing\nand hoarding we can do it; and those who persist in these activities will be\nseverely punished.\n      You may have read in the newspapers that a Bill was moved in\nParliament a few days ago and only last evening a law has been passed to\nput an end to these activities. The law will be implemented within a few\ndays and we shall take action to curb inflation. The Central Government\nhas assumed some powers to deal with the matter even at the State level\nin order to ensure uniform action throughout the country. But, as I said, we\nneed your help because it cannot be implemented without the help and\ncooperation of the people. Your complaint that the officials do not discharge\ntheir duties well and sometimes take bribes may be justified. We must\ncorrect such mistakes and remove the guilty officials.\n        There is another problem before us which concerns the whole of\nIndia and particularly the city of Delhi. This is the refugee problem. We\nhave made an effort to gradually solve this problem. But it is regrettable\nthat innumerable people are still in camps, braving the vagaries of weather\n- first the heat of the summer and now the rains. Time is passing, but the\nproblem remains unsolved. I would, however, like to point out that it is not\npossible for the Government to solve this problem on their own. We need\nthe help of the people, particularly the refugees. It is almost impossible for\nthe Government to solve every problem. We have succeeded to some\nextent here. But the problem has assumed terrible proportions in Bengal.\nAs you know, we reached an Agreement with Pakistan four months ago\nwhich has generated much discussion. Some people seem to think that we\nhave made a mistake. But that is irrelevant, if we are determined to solve\nthe problem, we can succeed. I do not want to go into the details just now,\nbut I want to tell you honestly and sincerely that though the problem of the\nBengali refugees is extremely complicated and troublesome, in my view, it\nis being gradually solved. I cannot make any promises about what happens\nin the future. That depends on the strength or weakness of the people. But\nI am not prepared to accept, even for a minute, that the situation is\nhopeless or that any steps should be taken which, instead of improving the\nsituation, will only bring ruin and hardship to Bengal and the rest of India.\n      Behind all such problems as food shortage and the rehabilitation of\nrefugees lies the real problem of the economic development of India. How\nare we to bring that about? It can be done only through cooperation\nbetween the Government and the people. Neither the Government nor the\npeople can do it on their own. You have every right to point out the\nweaknesses and shortcomings of the Government, to criticize them, and\nalso to change the Government any time that you choose. But in criticizing\nthe Government or objecting to their policies, you must not do anything\nwhich weakens India. You must be careful because very often people\nforget this. Governments and people come and go. Our time will also\ngradually come to an end. As I told you, we are soon going to have general\nelections. In any case, we will not be in power for ever. But so long as we\nhave the responsibility of administering the country, we cannot show any\nweakness. We must work hard and to the best of our ability, mental and\nphysical, so long as we are in charge, whether the danger is external or\ninternal.\n         I would like to repeat on this anniversary of India's independence that\nthough India is free, freedom brings in its wake its own responsibilities, not\nonly for the Government but for every single individual who enjoys that\nfreedom. If you do not understand and accept those responsibilities, it\nshows that you have not understood the true meaning of freedom and if\never that freedom is threatened, you will not be able to defend and protect\nit. If there is an external attack upon India, our armed services, the army,\nthe navy and the air force, in which some of our best young men work, will\nno doubt fight and repel it. But, ultimately, it is not the armed forces which\nsave a country; it is the men and women in the country who do so and\nunless every single individual in India considers himself or herself as India's\nsoldier, the country cannot remain safe. When we were fighting for\nfreedom, we did not wear any uniform and yet we regarded ourselves as\nsoldiers in the cause of freedom and faced the British empire fearlessly.\nPeople in other countries were amazed at what we dared to do -- a motley\nrabble of weak and unarmed human beings challenging the might of a\ngreat imperial power! But the strange thing is that at that time, there was no\nfear in our hearts. We had learnt the lesson of fearlessness from that great\nleader of ours, and so we went ahead boldly as soldiers of India's freedom.\nWe must create that atmosphere once again and learn to be completely\nfearless.\n     We must remember these fundamentals on the anniversary of India's\nindependence and avoid petty quarrels. The unity of India is of fundamental\nimportance. India can become strong and can progress only when there is\ncomplete equality for everyone, irrespective of religion, caste and province.\nAll doors of opportunity are open to everyone, and all the citizens of the\ncountry are equal shareholders in freedom. If there is disunity and people\nfight with each other, believe me, we shall weaken ourselves and the\ncountry's freedom. The only course open to us is to forge ahead and face\nthe problems which confront us, whether it is of food shortage or something\nelse, squarely and without fear or panic in our hearts. A man who is afraid\nis useless and unfit for anything. When the problems are bigger, we have to\nface them with greater fortitude instead of giving in to panic or running\naway in fear.\n      So I greet you once again on the third anniversary of our\nindependence. I hope that in the coming year we shall face our problems\nwith courage and determination, rather welcome them, and solve and\novercome them.

During these two years, we have seen achievements and failures, we\nhave experienced joy and sorrow. The good work we have done will remain\neven though we pass away. So will India, though generations come and go.\n      Great questions face us and our task will not be over till we have\nanswered them. Our objective is to make it possible for the millions of India\nto lead contented and purposeful lives. We cannot do that till we have\nsolved, to a large extent, the problems that face us.\n      On a day like this we should try to detach ourselves from the\nproblems of the moment and see from a distance, as it were, what is\nhappening in our country and in the world. It is right that we forget our little\ntroubles for a while and think of the major currents that are flowing in our\ncountry.\n       Thirty years ago there appeared on the Indian scene a mighty man of\ndestiny who lighted our path. That light illumined our minds and hearts and\nlarge numbers of our people, forgetting their own troubles and domestic\ndifficulties, their property and family, responded to his call. It was not for\npersonal gain of any kind. Among these there existed a friendly competition\nas to who could serve the motherland better and more effectively. Our\nconsuming obsession was the liberation of our country.\n       The star of a free India beckoned us forward. We dreamed of\nfreedom from poverty and distress. We gained our political freedom at last\nbut the other freedom still remains for us to achieve. Before we could do\nmuch to achieve it new problems came in our way. Sixty lakhs of people\nmigrated to India as refugees. We faced this problem as we had faced\nothers. I suppose we made some mistakes but no one reviewing these two\nyears will fail to appreciate our forward march in the face of all kinds of\ndifficulties.\n      Unarmed and peaceful, we faced a proud empire, not looking for aid\nto any other country and relying only on ourselves. We had faith in our\nleader, our country and in ourselves. This gave us the strength that\nsustained us during our struggle for independence. If we had faith and\nself-confidence when to outward seeming we were powerless, then surely\nwe are much better off today when we are a free people with the strength\nof a great country behind us. Why then should our faith and our confidence\nin ourselves weaken? It is true that we have tremendous economic and\nother difficulties to face; it is also true that while we have rehabilitated lakhs\nof refugees, large numbers still remain to be helped and rehabilitated. But\nwe have faced even bigger problems in the past. Why should we not face\nthese in the same way also? We must not let our minds get entangled in\npetty questions and difficulties and forget the main issues.\n      We belong to a great country, a country that is not only great\nphysically but in things far more important. If we are to be worthy of our\ncountry, we must have big minds and big hearts, for small men cannot face\nbig issues or accomplish big tasks. Let each one of us do his duty to his\ncountry and to his people and not dwell too much on the duty of others.\nSome people get into the habit of criticizing others without doing anything\nthemselves. Nothing good can come out of that type of criticism. So,\nwherever you may be, whether you are in the Army or the Air Force or the\nNavy or in the civil employ of the Government, each one of you must do\nyour duty efficiently and in a spirit of service to the nation. If the vast\nnumber of our countrymen apply themselves to their tasks in their\ninnumerable capacities and co-operate with others, forgetting the petty\nthings that divide them, we shall marvel at the speed with which India will\nprogress.\n      I want you to think for a moment of the days when we fought the\nbattle of India's freedom without arms and without much by way of\nresources. We had a great leader who inspired us. We had other leaders,\ntoo, but it was the masses of this country who bore the brunt of the\nstruggle. They had faith in their country and their leaders and they relied\nupon themselves. Today, we have more strength than we ever had. It is,\ntherefore, surprising that some people should feel dejected, have no\nconfidence in themselves and complain all the time.\n      Let us get back the purposefulness, the enthusiasm, the\nself-confidence and the faith which moved us at the time of our struggle for\nfreedom. Let us put aside our petty quarrels and factions and think only of\nthe great objective before us.\n      In our foreign policy, we have proclaimed that we shall join no power\nbloc and endeavour to co-operate and be friendly with all countries. Our\nposition in the world ultimately depends on the unity and strength of the\ncountry, on how far we proceed in the solution of our economic and other\nproblems and on how much we can raise the depressed masses of India.\nWe may not be able to complete that task, for it is colossal. Even so, if we\nmake some headway it will be easier for others to complete the task.\n        A nation's work never ends. Men may come and go, generations may\npass but the life of a nation goes on. We must remember the basic fact that\nwe can achieve little unless there is peace in the country, no matter what\npolicy we pursue. There are some misguided people who indulge in\nviolence and try to create disorder. I wonder how anybody with the least\nintelligence can think in terms of such anti-national activities. Bomb\nthrowing, for instance, can do the country no good. On the contrary, it\nfurther aggravates our economic situation, which is a source of great\nanxiety to us. Therefore, it is the duty of everyone, no matter what his\npolitics, to help in the maintenance of peace in the country.\n       The people have every right to change laws and even to change\ngovernments and they can exercise that right in a peaceful and democratic\nmanner. But those who choose the path of violence have no faith in\ndemocracy. If their way were to prevail, there would be complete chaos in\nthe country and the condition of the people would deteriorate even more.\nAll progress would cease and the next few generations would have to carry\na heavy burden.\n      I am still more distressed by those who, while condemning violence,\njoin hands with those who indulge in violence. They think only in terms of\nwinning an election and forget that the cause of the country and of the\npeople is bigger than any party. If we forget India and her people while\npursuing our smaller objectives, then we are indeed guilty of betraying our\ncountry. I wish to emphasize that all of us must understand that our most\nimportant objective is the safety and security of India and the prosperity\nand advancement of her people. That can only be achieved effectively if we\nstop quarrelling amongst ourselves and try to solve the great problems that\nconfront us by democratic and peaceful methods.\n     We must look at our problems in a proper perspective. If we are\npreoccupied with petty problems, we shall fail to solve the larger and more\nimportant ones.\n      We must learn to depend on ourselves and not look to others for help\nevery time we are in trouble. Certainly we want to make friends with the\nrest of the world. We also seek the goodwill and co-operation of all those\nwho reside in this country, whatever their race or nationality. We welcome\nhelp and co-operation from every quarter but we must depend primarily on\nour own resources. We should not forget that those who lean too much on\nothers tend to become weak and helpless themselves. A country's freedom\ncan be preserved only by her own strength and self-reliance.\n       We are not hostile to any country and we do not want to meddle in\nother people's affairs. Every nation should be free to choose the path it\nconsiders best. We do not wish to interfere with the freedom of other\nnations and we expect them to feel the same about our freedom. That is\nwhy we have decided not to join any of the power blocs in the world. We\nwill remain aloof and try to be friendly to all. We intend to progress\naccording to our own ideas. We have decided to follow this policy, not only\nbecause it is essentially a sound one from our country's point of view but\nalso because it seems to be the only way to serve the cause of world\npeace. Another world war will spell ruin and we shall not escape the\ngeneral disaster. We are determined to make every possible effort in the\ncause of peace. That explains our present foreign policy.\n      Perhaps you know that I am shortly going to visit a country which is\ngreat and powerful. I propose to carry with me a message of friendship and\nassurances of co-operation from our people. Keeping our own freedom\nintact, we wish to befriend other nations. Our friendship with one country\nshould not be interpreted as hostility to another.\n       Asia is passing through a great revolutionary phase and naturally\nIndia has also been affected. In other parts of Asia there is struggle and\nferment. This morning's newspaper contained the news of trouble and\nupheaval in a small but important country of Western Asia. We do not know\nall the facts and in any event I do not wish to express an opinion. All I want\nto say is that the prevalence of violence and violent methods weaken a\ncountry and undermine her progress.\n       In Eastern Asia, a great and ancient country is experiencing\nrevolutionary changes of tremendous significance. Whatever our individual\nreactions to these may be, our policy, namely, that we do not wish to\ninterfere in any way with the internal affairs of other countries, is clear.\nEach country should have the freedom to go the way it chooses. It is for its\npeople to decide their future. Any attempt at outside interference or\ncompulsion must necessarily lead to evil results. No country can impose\nfreedom on any other. That is a contradiction in terms. The world has a\ngreat deal of variety and it should be no one's business to suppress this\nvariety or to impose ways of thinking and acting on others. We should,\ntherefore, survey world events in a spirit of understanding and friendship to\nall.\n      Our Constituent Assembly is busy framing a new constitution for India\nand soon we shall adopt a republican form of government. However, laws\nand constitutions do not by themselves make a country great. It is the\nenthusiasm, energy and constant effort of a people that make it a great\nnation. Men of Law lay down constitutions but history is really made by\ngreat minds, large hearts and stout arms; by the sweat, tears and toil of a\npeople.\n      Let us, therefore, learn to study our country's problems in the larger\nperspective of the world and let us not permit the minor questions of the\nday to overwhelm us. I have faith in India and her great destiny. A country\nmust have military strength but armed power does not by itself constitute a\ncountry's real strength. Her real strength lies in the capacity of her people\nfor disciplined work. Only hard work can produce wealth for us and rid us of\nour poverty. Each one of us, man or woman, young or old, must, therefore\ntoil and work. Rest is not for us. We did not win our freedom so that we\nmight rest afterwards but in order to work harder to hold and strengthen\nthat freedom. There is a great difference between the voluntary labour of a\nfree man for an objective of his choice and the drudgery of a slave. Our\nlabours as free men and women will lay the foundations for a great future\nand our labour of love for the cause of India and her people will endure; so\nwill the fact that we are building, brick by brick, the great mansion of free\nIndia. There is joy in such work and even when we have departed that work\nwill be there for future generations to see.\n      One of our most important problems today is that of growing more\nfood. We must avoid wasting food at all costs. We must conserve our\npresent resources with great care. We have to tighten our belts. If the\nco-operation of the people is forthcoming, we shall solve not only this\nproblem but many others. Our petty squabbles and party differences can\nwait. What is vital and important for us is to keep before us the picture of a\ngreat India. India is enduring and will continue to be there long after we are\ngone."},{"year":1948,"pm":"Jawaharlal Nehru","party":"INC","title":"The Task Ahead","footnote":"Broadcast from New Delhi, August 15, 1948","source":"Jawaharlal Nehru's Speeches, Volume 1","text":"Fellow countrymen, comrades and friends! A year ago on this very\nday and at this very hour I broadcast to you from this place. Free India is\none year old today. But what trials and tribulations she has passed through\nduring this infancy of her freedom! She has survived, in spite of all the peril\nand disaster that might well have overwhelmed a more mature and well\nestablished nation. We have reason to be thankful for this achievement and\nfor the many other achievements that stand to the credit of our people. Let\nus not belittle our record or forget the courage, the sacrifice with which our\npeople have faced and overcome many of these perils during this fateful\nyear.\n       But let us also not forget where we have failed or have erred. For, our\nfailures and errors have been many. Some of these are obvious enough,\nbut the real failure has been a failure of the spirit and a falling away from\nthe standards set by the Father of our Nation, under whose wise guidance\nwe had struggled and marched for over a quarter of a century. He taught us\nthat worthy ends could only be achieved through worthy means, that ideals\nand objectives could never be divorced from the methods adopted to\nrealize them. He had told us to cast our fear, for fear is not only ignoble but\nis also the parent of hatred and violence.\n       Many of us forgot this lesson and fear gripped us, fear not of some\ndistant adversary, but fear of one another, and evil deeds followed in its\ntrain.\n       The Master who guided us and inspired us is no more. We have to\nshoulder the burden ourselves now and the first question that we have to\nput ourselves is this: Do we stand by his teaching and message or do we\nstray into new paths? I want to tell you that this year of hard trial has\nconvinced me more than ever that if India is to prosper and grow in stature,\nas she must and will, it will be through adherence to that message and\nteaching. I know I am feeble and have often proved unworthy of India to\nwhose service I had pledged myself so often. But however unworthy we\nmay be of India, we have still something of the strength that the Master\ngave us. That strength comes not only from him, but from his message,\nand so today I pledge myself anew to the service of the Motherland and of\nthe ideals that Gandhiji placed before us.\n      All of us talk of India and all of us demand many things from India.\nWhat do we give her in return? We can take nothing from her beyond what\nwe give her. India will ultimately give us what we give her of love and\nservice and productive and creative work. India will be what we are: our\nthoughts and actions will shape her. Born of her fruitful womb, we are\nchildren of hers, little bits of the India of today, and yet we are also the\nparents of the India of tomorrow. If we are big, so will India be, and if we\ngrow little-minded and narrow in outlook, so also will India be.\n       Our troubles during the past year were largely the result of this\nnarrowness in outlook and pettiness in action which is so foreign to India's\ngreat cultural inheritance. Communalism threatened to crush the free spirit\nin us, the communalism of the Muslim, of the Hindu and of the Sikh.\nProvincialism came in the way of that larger unity which is so essential to\nIndia's greatness and progress. The spirit of faction spread and made us\nforget the big things that we had stood for.\n      We have to find ourselves again and go back to the free India of our\ndreams. We have to rediscover the old values and place them in the new\nsetting of a free India. For freedom brings responsibility and can only be\nsustained by self-discipline, hard work, and the spirit of a free people.\n      So let us be rid of everything that limits us and degrades us. Let us\ncast out fear and communalism and provincialism. Let us build up a free\nand democratic India, where the interest of the masses of our people has\nalways the first place to which all other interests must submit.\n       Freedom has no meaning unless it brings relief to these masses from\ntheir many burdens. Democracy means tolerance, tolerance not merely of\nthose who agree with us, but of those who do not agree with us. With the\ncoming of freedom our patterns of behaviour must change also so as to fit\nin with this freedom.\n     There is conflict and there are rumours of greater conflict in India and\nall over the world. We have to be ready for every emergency and\ncontingency. When the nation is in peril, the first duty of every citizen is to\ngive his or her service to the nation without fear or expectation of reward.\nBut today I do not wish to speak of conflicts and wars but rather of peace\nand co-operation and I want to say to all the nations of the world, including\nour neighbour country, that we stand for peace and friendship with them.\nThe only war that we want to fight with all our might is the war against\npoverty and all its unhappy brood.\n       All the world suffers from the after-effects of the World War, and\ninflation and rising prices and unemployment oppress the people. In India\nwe have all these, and, in addition, the care of vast numbers of our brothers\nand sisters who have suffered untold hardship and have been driven away\nfrom their homes to seek a new life elsewhere.\n       It is this war we have to fight, the war against economic crisis and to\nrehabilitate the disinherited. In this war there is no hatred or violence but\nonly service of our country and our people. In this war every Indian can be\na soldier. This is no time for individuals or groups to think of a narrow\nself-interest forgetting the larger good. This is not time for wrangling or the\nspirit of action.\n      And so I appeal to my countrymen and all countrywomen who have\nthe love of India in their hearts and the passion to raise her masses to cast\naside the barriers that separate them and to join together in this historic\nand magnificent task worthy of a great people.\n       To all those in our Services, civil and military, I would appeal for a\nsingle-minded devotion to the cause of India and for integrity, hard work,\nefficiency and impartiality. He who fails in this at this critical hour fails in his\nduty to India and her people.\n      To the youth of the country I would make a special appeal for they\nare the leaders of tomorrow and on them will be cast the burden of\nupholding India's honour and freedom.\n      My generation is a passing one and soon we shall hand over the\nbright torch of India, which embodies her great and eternal spirit, to\nyounger hands and stronger arms. May they hold it aloft, undimmed and\nuntarnished, so that its light reaches every home and brings faith and\ncourage and well being to our masses.

Today I address you for the first\ntime officially as the First Servant of the Indian people, pledged to their\nservice and their betterment. I am here because you willed it so and I\nremain here so long as you choose to honour me with your confidence.\n      We are a free and sovereign people today and we have rid ourselves\nof the burden of the past. We look at the world with clear and friendly eyes\nand at the future with faith and confidence.\n      The burden of foreign domination is done away with, but freedom\nbrings its own responsibilities and burdens, and they can only be\nshouldered in the spirit of a free people, self-disciplined and determined to\npreserve and enlarge that freedom.\n         We have achieved much; we have to achieve much more. Let us then\naddress ourselves to our new tasks with the determination and adherence\nto high principles which our great leader has taught us. Gandhiji is\nfortunately with us to guide and inspire and ever to point to us the path of\nhigh endeavour. He taught us long ago that ideals and objectives can never\nbe divorced from the methods adopted to realize them; that worthy ends\ncan only be achieved through worthy means. If we aim at the big things of\nlife, if we dream of India as a great nation giving her age-old message of\npeace and freedom to others, then we have to be big ourselves and be\nworthy children of Mother India. The eyes of the world are upon us\nwatching this birth of freedom in the East and wondering what it means.\n       Our first and immediate objective must be to put an end to all internal\nstrife and violence, which disfigure and degrade us and injure the cause of\nfreedom. They come in the way of consideration of the great economic\nproblems of the masses of the people which so urgently demand attention.\n       Our long subjection and the World War and its aftermath have made\nus inherit an accumulation of vital problems, and today our people lack food\nand clothing and and other necessaries, and we are caught in a spiral of\ninflation and rising prices. We cannot solve these problems suddenly, but\nwe cannot also delay their solution. So we must plan wisely so that the\nburdens on the masses may grow less and the standards of living go up.\nWe wish ill to none, but it must be clearly understood that the interests of\nour long-suffering masses must come first and every entrenched interest\nthat comes in their way must yield to them. We have to change rapidly our\nantiquated land tenure system, and we have also to promote\nindustrialization on a large and balanced scale, so as to add to the wealth\nof the country, and thus to the national dividend which can be equitably\ndistributed.\n      Production today is the first priority, and every attempt to hamper or\nlessen production is injuring the nation, and more especially harmful to our\nlabouring masses. But production by itself is not enough, for this may lead\nto an even greater concentration of wealth in a few hands, which comes in\nthe way of progress and which, in the context of today, produces instability\nand conflict. Therefore, fair and equitable distribution is essential for any\nsolution of the problem.\n      The Government of India have in hand at present several vast\nschemes for developing river valleys by controlling the flow of rivers,\nbuilding dams and reservoirs and irrigation works and developing\nhydro-electric power. These will lead to all-round development. These\nschemes are thus basic to all planning and we intend to complete them as\nrapidly as possible so that the masses may profit.\n      All this requires peaceful conditions and the co-operation of all\nconcerned, and hard and continuous work. Let us then address ourselves\nto these great and worthy tasks and forget our mutual wrangling and\nconflicts. There is a time for quarrelling and there is a time for co-operative\nendeavour. There is a time for work and there is a time for play: Today,\nthere is no time for quarrelling or overmuch play, unless we prove false to\nour country and our people. Today, we must co-operate with one another\nand work together, and\nwork with right goodwill.\n     I should like to address a few words to our services, civil and military.\nThe old distinction and differences are gone and today we are all free sons\nand daughters of India, proud of our country's freedom and joining together\nin our service of her. Our common allegiance is to India. In the difficult days\nahead our Services and our experts have a vital role to play and we invite\nthem to do so as comrades in the service of India. JAI HIND."}]
