2022,Narendra Modi,BJP,NA,English rendering of the text of PM’s address from the Red Fort on 76th Independence Day,Press Information Bureau,https://pib.gov.in/,"Best wishes to my dear countrymen on the momentous occasion of
completion of 75 years of Independence. Many congratulations to all! It is
heartening to see our tricolor being unfurled with pride, honor and glory, not
only in all the corners of India, but also worldwide by Indians who love their
country immensely. I extend my heartiest congratulations to all the people
spread across the globe who love India. My heartfelt greetings to all my
dear Indians on this Amrit Mahotsav festival of celebrating our freedom.
This is a day of historic importance. This is an auspicious occasion to step
forward on a new path, with a new resolution and a new strength.

In the pursuit of Independence, the entire period of slavery was spent in
struggle. No part of India or any time period remained untouched by the
freedom struggle against several centuries of slavery and marked by
people sacrificing themselves facing torutre and making supreme sacrifice.
Today is an opportunity for all of us countrymen to bow down and salute all
such brave hearts, the legends of every sacrifice made by every great soul.
This is an opportunity to also solemnly acknowledge their debt and pledge
to fulfil their dreams at the earliest with deep resolve. All the countrymen
are deeply indebted to Pujya Bapu, Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose,
Babasaheb Ambedkar, Veer Savarkar, who devoted all their life on the path
of duty towards the nation.The path of obligation has been their sole life
path. This country is grateful to Mangal Pandey, Tatya Tope, Bhagat Singh,
Sukhdev, Rajguru, Chandrashekhar Azad, Ashfaqulla Khan, Ram Prasad
Bismil and countless such revolutionaries of ours who shook the
foundations of British rule. This nation is grateful to those brave women, be
it Rani Lakshmibai, Jhalkari Bai, Durga Bhabhi, Rani Gaidinliu, Rani
Chennamma, Begum Hazrat Mahal, Velu Nachiyar, who showed the mettle
of women power of India. What is the resolve of India's ‘Nari Shakti’? Every
Indian is filled with pride while remembering the countless brave women
who achieved the pinnacle of sacrifice.

Today is an opportunity to pay homage to countless such great men like Dr.
Rajendra Prasad ji, Nehru ji, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Shyama Prasad
Mookerjee, Lal Bahadur Shastri, Deendayal Upadhyay, Jai Prakash
Narayan, Ram Manohar Lohia, Acharya Vinoba Bhave, Nanaji Deshmukh,
Subramania Bharati who fought the war of independence and built the
country after independence.

When we talk about the freedom struggle, we cannot forget to acknowledge
our tribal society living in forests. There are countless names like Bhagwan
Birsa Munda, Sidhu-Kanhu, Alluri Sitarama Raju, Govind Guru, who
became the voice of freedom movement and inspired my tribal brothers
and sisters, mothers and youth in the remotest jungles to live and die for
the motherland. It has been the good fortune of the country that there have
been many aspects of the freedom struggle. And one such aspect was
when many such great men like Narayana Guru, Swami Vivekananda,
Maharishi Aurobindo, Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore kept awakening the
consciousness of India in every corner and every village of India, and kept
this consciousness alive.

For the last year, we are witnessing how the country (is celebrating) the
‘Amrit Mahotsav’. It all began with Dandi Yatra in 2021. The people held
programs in every district, every corner, of India to enlarge the scope of
goals of the ‘Amrit Mahotsav’ of Independence. This was perhaps for the
first time in history that such a huge and comprehensive festival for a single
purpose was celebrated. An attempt was made in every corner of India to
remember all those great men who did not find mention in history for some
reasons or who were forgotten. Today, the nation sought out all such
heroes and great men, selfless, brave men from every corner of the country
and paid tributes to them. It was an opportunity to pay tributes to all these
great men during the ‘Amrit Mahotsav’.

Yesterday on 14th August, India also remembered the deep wounds of
Partition on ‘Partition Vibhishika Memorial Day’ with a heavy heart. Crores
of such people had endured a lot for the glory of the tricolour. They had
endured so much due to their love for the motherland and they did not lose
patience. Their determination to start a new life with their love for India is
inspirational and worth saluting.
Today, as we are celebrating the 'Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav', it is an
opportunity to recall the contributions made by those who lived and died for
the country, dedicated their lives for the country during the last 75 years,
those who protected the country and fulfilled the country's resolutions; be it
the army personnel, police personnel, bureaucrats, public representatives,
administrators of the local self-government, state administration or central
administration. Today we must also recall the contributions made by the
crores of citizens of the country who have done everything possible to take
the country forward despite various challenges in 75 years.

My dear countrymen,

This journey of 75 years has been full of ups and downs. Amidst the
shadow of good and bad times our countrymen have accomplished various
achievements; they have made efforts and have not given up. They didn't
let the resolutions fade away. It is true that the hundreds of years of colonial
rule had inflicted deep wounds on India and the sentiments of the Indians,
but the people were resilient and passionate. And that's why, Indians
managed to revive the nation despite scarcity and denigration. When the
freedom struggle was in its final stages, all measures were taken to
frighten, disappoint and frustrate the country. There were apprehensions
that after independence when the British would leave, the country would be
scattered and in shambles; people would die fighting internal wars; India
would plunge into a dark age.

But they were not aware that this is the soil of India. This country has the
unlimited potential to survive across centuries and influence even beyond
the powerful rulers. It is as a result of such immense capabilities and
resilience that our nation has emerged strong despite facing innumerable
adversities be it food crisis or war. We have aborted challenges hurled at us
by terrorist activities which killed our innocent countrymen. We endured
proxy war, natural calamities, successes and failures, hopes and despair
yet remained undaunted at all such junctures. But even in the midst of
these abysmal stages, India has been relentlessly progressing. India's
diversity, which others once thought was a burden to India, is proven to be
the priceless power of India. A strong testimony of its power.

The world was not cognizant that India has an inherent potential of strong
culture and values, a bond of thoughts deeply embedded in mind and soul;
and that is - India is Mother of democracy. And when those who have
democracy pulsating in their minds walk with determination and resolve, it
augurs doom for the most powerful sultanates of the world. This Mother of
Democracy, our India has proven to all that we have this invaluable
strength.

My dear countrymen,

In the journey of 75 years, in the midst of hopes, aspirations, ups and
downs, it is with everyone's effort that we could reach this far. And when in
2014, my countrymen gave me this responsibility, I was the first Indian born
in free India, who got the privilege to sing praises of glory to my dear
countrymen from the ramparts of the Red Fort. But whatever I have learned
today is from all of you. I have been able to understand your happiness and
sorrows. I could sense your soul calling about the hopes and aspirations
you have for your country. With whatever I could embrace of your dreams, I
immersed myself fully in empowering those countrymen during my tenure
who were left behind and deprived from being a part of the mainstream. Be
they the marginalised, outcast, exploited, victimized, deprived, tribals,
women, youth, farmers, or the divyang people. From the farthest of India’s
east or west, north or south, ocean beds or Himalayan peaks, I have
dedicated myself to fulfil Mahatma Gandhi’s vision of inclusion. I have
committed myself to his vision of empowering and uplifting the person
sitting at the last mile. I can see the fruition of this mission in the past eight
years because of the experience gained over several decades of
independence. We are embarking on the glorious years of 75 years today
on Amrit Mahotsav. On the first morning of this Amrit Kaal I am filled with
pride to see such an immensely endowed nation.

Dear countrymen,
I am witnessing the biggest fortune today that Indians have emerged as an
Aspirational Society. Being an aspirational society is the biggest asset for
any nation. And we are proud that today every corner of India, every
section and strata of our society is brimming with aspirations.

Every citizen of the country wants to change things, wants to see things
change, but is not ready to wait. He wants these things to happen in front of
his eyes and wants to do it as part of his duty. He wants speed, he wants
progress. He is eager and excited to fulfill all the dreams cherished in 75
years before his eyes. It may cause problems to some people. Because
when there is an aspirational society, then even the governments have to
walk on the edge of the sword and also have to charge with the times. And
I believe whether it is the central government, state governments,
institutions of local self-government, no matter what kind of governance
system, everyone has to address this aspirational society and we cannot
wait longer for their aspirations. Our aspirational society has waited for a
long time. But now they are not ready to force their future generations to
live in wait and hence the first dawn of this ‘Amrit Kaal’ has brought a huge
golden opportunity for us to fulfill the aspirations of that aspirational society.

My dear countrymen,

Recently, we have seen and experienced one such force and that is the
renaissance of the collective consciousness in India. The renaissance of
such collective consciousness, a nectar of so many struggles for freedom,
is now being preserved and compiled. It is turning into a resolution, the
culmination of effort is reckoned and the path of accomplishment is visible. I
think that this awakening of consciousness, this renaissance, is our
greatest asset.

Look at this renaissance. Until 10th August, people would not even be
aware of the power within the country. But for the last three days, the way
the country has set about celebrating the journey of the Tricolour, even the
leading experts of social science can't imagine the power within my country
which has been shown by the Tricolor. This is the moment of
re-consciousness and renaissance. People are still to understand this. One
can experience this consciousness when every corner of India comes out
to observe ‘Janata Curfew’. There is a feeling of consciousness when the
country stands shoulder to shoulder with the corona warriors by clapping
and clanging utensils. This consciousness is felt when the country goes out
to greet the corona warriors by lighting a lamp. During Corona, the world
was grappling with the confusion whether to take vaccines or not or
whether the vaccines are useful or not. At that time, even the poor people
of my country's villages surprised the world with the administration of 200
crore vaccine doses. This is consciousness; this is potential, which has
given new strength to the country today.

My dear brothers and sisters,

I can see an important potential. Like an aspirational society, like
renaissance the attitude of the whole world towards India has changed in
the same way after so many decades of independence. The world is
looking at India with pride and with anticipation. The world has started
looking for solutions to the problems on the soil of India, friends. This
change in the world, this change in the thinking of the world is the result of
our experience and journey of the last 75 years.

The world is observing the way we have started moving ahead with the
resolution, and ultimately the world too is living with a new hope. The world
has started realising where the power to fulfil the expectations actually lies.
I see it as triple power or 'tri-shakti' i.e. aspiration, re-awakening and the
world's expectations. We are fully cognisant of this, today, my countrymen
have a major role in awakening. 130 crore countrymen after several
decades of experience have shown the world the importance of a stable
government, the power of political stability, policies and how trust develops
in the policies. The world too is now realising it. And now when there is
political stability, dynamism in policies, speed in decision making, ubiquity
and universal trust, then everyone becomes a partner in development.
We started our journey with the mantra of ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas’, but
gradually the countrymen have added more colours to it with ‘Sabka
Vishwas and Sabka Prayas’. So, we have seen our collective power and
collective potential. 'Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav’ is being celebrated with the
campaign to build 75 Amrit Sarovars in every district today. People from
every village are joining the campaign and offering their services. With their
own efforts, the people are running a massive campaign for water
conservation in their respective villages. Therefore brothers and sisters,
whether it is a campaign for cleanliness or the work for the welfare of the
poor, the country is moving ahead with full force today.

But brothers and sisters, if we continue to glorify our 75-years of journey in
the 'Azadi Ka AmritKaal' and keep patting our own backs, then our dreams
might be pushed far away. So, even if the past 75 years have been
wonderful, full of various challenges and certain unfulfilled dreams, yet
today when we are entering the 'Azadi Ka AmritKaal', the next 25 years are
very significant for our country. And that's why today as I am talking about
the strength of 130 crore countrymen, witnessing their dreams and feeling
their resolutions from the ramparts of Red Fort, I believe we must focus our
attention on the 'Panch Pran' for the coming 25 years. You have to
concentrate on your resolve and strength. And we must take up the
responsibility of fulfilling all the dreams of the freedom fighters by
embracing those 'Panch Pran' by 2047 when the country celebrates 100
years of independence.

Speaking of 'Panch Pran', the first vow is for the country to move ahead
with a big resolve. And that big resolution is of a developed India; and now
we should not settle for anything less than that. Big resolution! The second
Pran is that in no part of our existence, not even in the deepest corners of
our mind or habits should there be any ounce of slavery. It should be
nipped there itself. Now, 100 per cent this slavery of hundreds of years has
kept us bound, has forced us to keep our emotions tied up, have developed
distorted thinking in us. We have to liberate ourselves from the slavery
mind set which is visible in innumerable things within and around us. This is
our second Pran Shakti.
The third Pran is that we should feel proud of our heritage and legacy.
Since it is this same legacy which had given India its golden period in the
past. And it is this legacy that has an innate capability of transforming itself
with time. It is this rich heritage that transcends tests of tide and times. It
embraces the new. And hence we should be proud of this heritage.

Fourth Pran which is equally important is unity and solidarity. Amongst 130
million countrymen when there is harmony and bonhomie, unity becomes
its strongest virtue. ""Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat"" – is one of the unifying
initiatives to actuate the dream of the fourth Pran.

Fifth Pran is the duty of the citizens, in which even the Prime Minister, Chief
Minister cannot be an exclusion as they are also responsible citizens and
have a duty towards the nation. This virtue is going to be the vital life force
if we want to achieve the dreams we have for the next 25 years.

My dear countrymen

When your dreams are big, your resolve is big, and therefore endeavours
should also be bigger. Strength also adds up to a great extent. Recall the
period of 40-42, it is difficult to imagine now how the country emerged from
the shackles of the treacherous British rule. Some hands picked up
brooms, while some chose spindles, while several chose the path towards
satyagrah, some chose to struggle while many treaded the path of bravery
of revolution. But the resolve of each was big- that of Freedom. Just see
the power of their big goal– they achieved freedom for us. We became
independent. Had their resolution would have been small and limited, we
would have prolonged our days of struggle and slavery, but kudos to their
indomitable spirit and big dreams, we could finally attained our freedom.

My dear countrymen,

As we wake up to this auspicious morning of 76th Independence, we must
resolve to make India a developed nation in the next 25 years. The youth of
today, all of 20-22-25 years, who I can see here shall be a witness to the
glorious centennial celebrations of Independence. You will be 50-55 years
old then, that means this golden period of your life, these 25-30 years of
your age is the time to fulfill the dreams of India. Take a pledge and walk
with me, friends, take the oath of the Tricolor and let us all join with full
strength. This should be our great resolve that my country will be a
developed country, we will develop a people-centric system in every
parameter of development and we will have every human being and his
hopes and aspirations at our center. We know that when India makes great
resolutions, it also implements them.

When I first spoke about cleanliness during my first speech, the entire
country embraced it. Everyone moved towards cleanliness as per his
capacity and there is now antipathy towards filthiness. This is the country
which has done it, is doing it and will continue to do so in future also. When
the world was in a dilemma, this is the country which crossed the target of
200 crore vaccinations in a time-bound manner and broke all the previous
records. We are dependent on the fuel from the Gulf. We had decided how
to move towards bio-oil. The 10 percent ethanol blending seemed like a
very big dream. Old experiences showed that it was not possible, but the
country has realized this dream of 10 percent ethanol blending before time.

Brothers and sisters,

Providing electricity connection to 2.5 crore people in such a short time was
not a small task, but the country has done it. Today the country is rapidly
providing 'water from tap' to the homes of lakhs of families. Freedom from
open defecation has become possible in India today.

My dear countrymen,

Experience tells us that we can achieve our goals once we are determined.
Be it the goal of renewable energy, the intention of building new medical
colleges in the country or creating a workforce of doctors, the pace has
increased a lot in every field. And that's why I say that the coming 25 years
should be of huge resolutions, this should be our life and this should be our
pledge.

The second thing that I have mentioned is the mentality of slavery and the
attitude of the country. Brothers, how long will the world continue to give
certificates to us? How long will we live on the certificates of the world?
Shall we not set our own standards? Can a country of 130 crores not make
an effort to exceed its standards? Under no circumstances should we try to
look like others. It should be our temperament to grow with our own
potential. We want freedom from slavery. The element of slavery should not
remain in our mind even under the distant seven seas, friends. And I look
with hope the way the new National Education Policy has been formulated
with a lot of brainstorming, with the exchange of ideas from various people
and is at the root of the country’s education policy. The skill that we have
emphasized is such a power, which will give us the strength to be free from
slavery.

We have seen that sometimes our talent gets tied in the shackles of
language. This is the result of slave mentality. We should be proud of every
language of our country. We may or may not know the language, but we
should be proud that it is the language of my country and it is the language
given to the world by our ancestors.

Friends,

Today we are witnessing the structure of Digital India. We are looking at
start-ups. Who are these people? This is that pool of talent who lives in
Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities, or in villages and belongs to poor families. These
are our youngsters who are coming before the world today with new
discoveries. We have to give up the colonial-era mentality. Instead, we
must rely on our capabilities.

Secondly, we must feel proud of our heritage. Only when we connect with
our land, we will be able to fly high, and when we fly high, we will be able to
provide solutions to the world too. We have seen the impact when we take
pride in our heritage and culture. Today the world is talking about holistic
health care. But when it talks about holistic health care, it looks towards
India's yoga, India's Ayurveda and India's holistic lifestyle. This is our
legacy that we are providing the world with. The world is being influenced
by it today. Now look at our strength. We are the people who know how to
live with nature. We know how to love nature. Today the world is facing
environment related problems. We have that legacy and the solutions to the
problems of global warming. Our ancestors have given us the same. When
we talk about an environment-friendly lifestyle and LIFE mission, we attract
the attention of the world. We have this power. Coarse paddy and millets
are household items. This is our heritage. Due to the hard work of our small
farmers paddy flourished on small pieces of land. Today the world is
moving ahead to celebrate the millet year at the international level. That
means our heritage is being appreciated around the world today. Let us
learn to be proud of it. We have a lot to offer to the world.

When it comes to social stress, people talk of our family values; whenever
it comes to personal stress, people talk of yoga. When it comes to
collective tension, the people talk of the family system of India. The joint
family system is an asset. Due to the sacrifices made by our mothers and
sisters over the centuries, the 'joint family system' has evolved as a legacy.
This is our legacy. How can we not be proud of this heritage? We are those
people who see Shiva in every living being. We are those people who see
Lord Narayana in every man. We are people who call women 'Narayani'.
We are people who see the divine in the plants. We are the people who
consider the rivers as mother. We are those people who see Shankar in
every stone. This is our power. It is our potential to see every river as a
form of mother. Such enormity of the environment is our pride! When we
are proud of such heritage, the world too will feel proud of it.

Brothers and sisters,

We are the people who have given the world the mantra of ""Vasudhaiva
Kutumbakam"". We are the people who believe in ""Ekam Sadvipra Bahudha
Vadanti"".
In the period of ‘holier than thou’ mentality, today the world is facing a
severe crisis due to conflicts caused by the attitude of one upmanship- the
reason for all tensions. We have the wisdom to resolve this. Our scholars
have said “Ekam Sat Vipra Bahudha Vadanti” meaning that absolute Truth
is one but it is manifested differently. This is our glory. We are the ones who
say ""yat pinde tat brahmande”, such a wise thought that Whatever is in the
universe is in every living being. We were the proponents of such human
values.

We are the people who have seen the welfare of the world; we have been
on the path of collective good and individual good, not only for our people
but the whole world by believing in “sarve bhavantu sukhinaḥ, sarve santu
nirāmayāḥ”. It is ingrained in our values that we will pray that may all be
prosperous and happy, may all be free from illness, may all see what is
auspicious, and may no one suffer. It is our heritage to care for the
happiness and good health of all. Hence, we should learn to honour and
feel proud of our heritage and value system. It is the strength of our resolve
that will be crucial in achieving the dreams in the next 25 years.

In the same way, my dear countrymen,

Another very important issue is Unity and solidarity. We need to celebrate
the diversity of our huge country. The peaceful co-existence of innumerable
traditions and creeds are our pride. For us all are equal. No one is inferior
or superior; all are our own. This feeling of oneness is important for unity.
The foundations of unity can be laid in every home only if son and daughter
enjoy equality. If the family seeds gender discrimination across its
generations then the spirit of Unity can never be woven in society. Gender
equality is our first stipulation. When we talk of Unity, why not have only
one parameter or standard-that of India First. All my endeavours,
everything that I am thinking, saying, envisioning or visualising is in
accordance with India First. This way the path to Unity can be opened for
all of us my friend. This is the mantra we need to embrace to bind all of us
in oneness. I have full faith that we can thus diminish the discrimination
prevalent in our society. We endorse the value of Shramev Jayate which
means that it should be in our nature to respect the labourer.

But my brothers and sisters

From the ramparts of Red Fort, I also want to share one of my enduring
pains. I cannot hold myself from expressing my pain. I am mindful that it
may not befit the podium of the Red Fort. But I will still express my deepest
feelings of agony to my countrymen. If I do not open up in front of the
countrymen, then where will I say it after all? What I wish to share is that it
hurts me to say that we have witnessed a perversion in our day-to-day
speaking, behavior. We have been casually using language and words that
are insulting to women. Can we not pledge to get rid of everything in our
behavior, culture and everyday life that humiliates and demeans women?
Women's pride is going to be a huge asset in fulfilling the dreams of the
nation. I see this power and therefore I am insistent on it.

Dear countrymen,

I will now talk about the fifth life force – pran which is the duties of citizens.
While trying to understand all the countries in the world that have made
progress; every country that has achieved something, even in personal life,
few things emerged. One is disciplined life, and the other is devotion to
duty. There should be success in the life of the individual, of the society, of
the family, of the nation. This is the fundamental path and the fundamental
vital force.

It is the job of the government to make efforts to provide 24 hours electricity
but it is the duty of the citizen to save as many units as he can. It is the
responsibility and efforts of the government to supply water to every field,
but a voice should come from each of my fields that we will move forward
by saving water by focusing on 'per drop more crop'. It is our duty to do
chemical free farming, organic farming and natural farming. Friends,
whether it is police or people, ruler or administrator, no one can be
untouched by this civic duty. If everyone performs the duties of a citizen, I
am sure that we can achieve the desired goals ahead of time.

My dear countrymen,

Today is also the birth anniversary of Maharishi Aurobindo. I bow at the feet
of that great man. But we need to remember the great man who gave a call
for ‘Swadeshi to Swaraj’ and ‘Swaraj to Suraj’. This is his mantra. We all
need to think how long we will be dependent on other people of the world.
Can we outsource when our country needs food grains? When the country
decided that we will meet our food requirements, did the country
demonstrate it or not? Once we take a resolution, it is possible. And,
therefore, ‘AatmaNirbhar Bharat’ becomes the responsibility of every
citizen, every government and every unit of society. ‘AatmaNirbhar Bharat’
is not a government agenda or a government programme. This is a mass
movement of society, which we have to take forward.

My friends, today we heard this sound after 75 years of independence for
which our ears were yearning to hear. For the first time after 75 years, the
Made in India cannon has saluted the Tricolour from the Red Fort. Will
there be any Indian who will not be inspired by this sound? My dear
brothers and sisters, today I want to congratulate the soldiers of the army of
my country from my heart. I salute the way the army jawans have
shouldered this responsibility of self-reliance in an organized way and with
courage. The soldier of the army carries death in his hands. He stands
firmly in the middle when there is no gap between death and life. The
resolution of our country is not small when the armed forces make a list
and decide not to import 300 defence products.

In this resolution, I can see the seed of a bright future of 'Atmanirbhar
Bharat' that will convert this dream into a banyan tree. Salute! Salute!
Salute to my army officers!
 I also want to salute the little children between 5 and 7 years of age. The
nation's consciousness has been awakened. I have heard from countless
families that 5-7 year old children tell their parents that they do not want to
play with foreign toys. When a 5-year-old child makes such a resolution, it
reflects the spirit of self-reliant India in him.

Speaking of the PLI scheme, one lakh crore rupees, people from around
the world are coming to India to try their luck. They are bringing new
technology along with them. They are generating new employment
opportunities. India is becoming a manufacturing hub. It is building a
foundation for a Self-reliant India. Be it manufacturing of electronic goods
or mobile phones, today the country is progressing at a very fast pace.
Which Indian wouldn't be proud when our Brahmos is exported to the
world? Today the Vande Bharat train and our metro coaches are becoming
objects of attraction for the world.

My dear countrymen,

We have to become self-reliant in the energy sector. How long will we be
dependent on others in the field of energy? We should be self-reliant in the
fields of solar energy, wind energy, and various other renewable energy
sources like Mission Hydrogen, bio fuel and electric vehicles.

My dear countrymen,

Today natural farming is also a way of becoming self-reliant. Today the
factories of Nano Fertilizer have brought a new hope in the country. But
natural farming and chemical-free farming can give a boost to self-reliance.
Today, new employment opportunities in the form of green jobs are opening
up very fast in the country. India has opened up 'space' through its policies.
India has come up with the most progressive policy regarding drones in the
world. We have opened up new doors of opportunities for the youth of the
country.

My dear brothers and sisters,
I also call upon the private sector to come forward. We have to dominate
the world. One of the dreams of a self-reliant India is to ensure that India
does not lag behind in fulfilling the needs of the world. Even if it is the
MSMEs we have to take our products to the world with 'Zero Defect - Zero
Effect'. We have to be proud of Swadeshi.

My dear Countrymen,

Till today we always remember our revered Lal Bahadur Shastri ji for his
inspirational clarion call of Jai Jawan Jai Kisan meaning “Hail the Soldier,
Hail the Farmer"". Later Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji added a new link of Jai
Vigyan which meant “hail science” and we gave it utmost importance. But in
this new phase Amrit Kaal now it is imperative to add jai anusandhaan that
is “hail innovation”.

Jai Jawan Jai Kisan Jai Vigyan Jai Anusandhaan.

I repose my utmost faith in our youth of the nation. Witness the power of
indegenious innovations. Today we have many success stories to show to
the world - UPI-BHIM, our digital payment, our compelling position in the
domain of Fintech. Today in the world, 40 percent of real time digital
financial transactions are happening in my country. India has shown
innovation prowess to the world.

My dear Countrymen,

Today we are all set to enter the 5G era. You don't have to wait too long
before we match the global steps. We are ensuring that optical fiber
reaches each and every village until the last mile. I am fully informed that
the dream of Digital India will be attained through rural India. Today I am
happy that four lakh Common Service Centers of India are being developed
in villages which are being managed by the youth of that village. Nation can
take pride in the fact that four lakh Digital Entrepreneurs are being nurtured
in the villages, and the rural population is becoming accustomed to benefit
from all the services. Such is the power of India to become a technology
hub in itself.

My dear countrymen,

This Digital India movement of developing semiconductors, entering the 5G
era, spreading the network of optical fibres is not just to establish ourselves
as modern and developed, but it is possible because of three intrinsic
missions. The complete transformation of the education ecosystem,
revolution in health infrastructure and improvement in the quality of
agricultural life will be possible only through digitalisation.

Friends,

I can foresee that India will march ahead phenomenally in this decade
which is hailed as the techade for humanity. It is a decade of technology. In
the field of IT india has become a force to reckon with globally. We have the
competencies to contribute in this techade.

Our Atal Innovation Mission, our incubation centres, our startups are
developing a whole new sector, opening up new opportunities for the
younger generation. Whether it is a matter of space mission, whether it is
about our Deep Ocean Mission, whether we want to go deep into the ocean
or we have to touch the sky, these are new areas, by which we are moving
forward.

My dear countrymen,

Let us not forget this and India has seen this for centuries, while some
model works are needed in the country, some great heights must be
achieved, but at the same time we should remain rooted and grounded
while accomplishing heights as a nation.

Potential of the economic advancement of India is dependent on the
strength of the grassroot. Hence, we must acknowledge and strengthen the
potential of our small farmers, entrepreneurs, small and medium sized
enterprises, cottage industries, micro industries, street vendors, domestic
labourers, daily wagers, auto rickshaw drivers, bus service providers etc.
These form the largest population who need to be empowered. Being able
to do so shall guarantee India's potential and therefore our efforts are going
in the direction of giving maximum emphasis to this strata which is the
fundamental grass root force of our economic development.

My dear Countrymen

We have 75 years of experience, and we have also achieved many
accomplishments in these 75 years. We have cherished new dreams and
taken new resolutions in 75 years of experience. But, what should be the
optimum outcome of our human resources for the ‘Amrit Kaal? How to get
the optimum outcome of our natural wealth? We have to move forward with
this goal. I want to say something from the experience of the last few years.
You must have seen the power of ‘Nari Shakti’ in courts who are working in
the field of Law. Look at the public representatives in the rural area. Our
‘Nari Shakti’ is devotedly engaged in solving the problems of our villages.
Look at the field of knowledge or science, the ‘Nari Shakti’ of our country is
visible right at the top. Even in the police force, our ‘Nari Shakti’ is taking
the responsibility of protecting the people. In every walk of life, whether it is
the playground or the battlefield, the ‘Nari Shakti’ of India is coming forward
with a new strength and a new belief. I can see the manifold contribution of
‘Nari Shakti’, my mothers, sisters and daughters, in the next 25 years
compared to the contribution in the last 75 years of India's journey. And
hence, it is beyond assessment. Everything is beyond your parameters.
The more we pay attention to this aspect, the more opportunities and
facilities we provide to our daughters, they will return us much more than
that. They will take the country to a new height. If the considerable efforts of
our ‘Nari Shakti’ are added to the hard work that is required to fulfill the
dreams in this ‘Amrit Kaal’, then it will take less hard work and our time limit
will also be reduced. Our dreams will be more intense, vivacious and
resplendent.
Therefore, friends, let's move ahead with our responsibilities. Today I also
want to thank the framers of the Constitution of India for giving us the
federal structure. Our dreams are bound to be realized if we walk shoulder
to shoulder by maintaining this spirit and respecting its sentiments in this
‘Amrit Kaal’. Programs may differ, working styles may differ, but resolutions
can’t differ, dreams for a nation cannot be different.

Let us move towards such an era. I remember the government at the
Centre did not belong to our ideology when I was the Chief Minister of
Gujarat. But I used to follow the same mantra that the progress of Gujarat
is for the progress of India. India’s progress should be at the core of our
heart wherever we are. There are many states of our country, which have
played a great role in taking the country forward, have led and worked as
examples in many fields. This gives strength to our federalism. But today
the need of the hour is that we need cooperative federalism as well as
cooperative competitive federalism. We need competition for development.

Every state should feel that it is moving ahead, that it will race ahead by
toiling hard. If a particular state has done 10 good tasks, others shall do 15
good tasks. If a state has completed a job in three years, others should
complete the same job in two years. There should be an atmosphere of
competition between the states and all the units of the government which
should strive to take us to new peaks of development.

My dear countrymen,

When we talk of the 25 years of Amrit Kaal, I know that there would be
many challenges, limitations and problems. We do not underestimate
these. We keep on looking for ways and are constantly striving but I wish to
discuss two things here. There may be many issues to discuss but
considering the time constraint, I would like to talk about two things right
now. And I believe that because of all these challenges and problems if we
do not take corrective steps while there is still time during 25 years of 'Amrit
Kaal', then it could take a turn for the worse. So, I do not want to discuss
everything but would definitely want to focus on two issues. One is
corruption and the other is nepotism and the dynasty system. In a
democracy like India where people are struggling with poverty and do not
have a place to live, there are people who do not have a place to keep their
ill-gotten money. This is not an ideal situation. So we have to fight against
corruption with all our might. In the last eight years, we have been
successful in working for the betterment of the country by saving two lakh
crore rupees which used to go into the wrong hands, using all the modern
systems like Direct Benefit Transfer, Aadhaar and Mobile. Those who fled
the country after looting banks during the tenure of the previous
government, we have seized their property and are trying to get them back.
Some have been forced to go behind the bars. We are trying to ensure that
those who looted the country are compelled to return.

Brothers and sisters,

I can clearly see that we are entering a crucial period against corruption.
Even the big ones will not be able to escape. With this spirit, India is now
stepping into a decisive period against corruption. And I am saying this with
a great responsibility from the ramparts of the Red Fort. Brothers and
sisters, the corrupt are eating away the country like termites. I have to fight
against it, intensify the fight and have to take it to a decisive point. So, my
130 crore countrymen, please bless me and support me! Today I have
come to seek your support and cooperation so that I can fight this battle. I
hope the country becomes victorious in this war. The lives of the ordinary
citizens have been ruined by corruption. So, I want to make sure that the
ordinary citizens are once again able to live with dignity. My dear
countrymen, it is a matter of great concern that although abhorrence of
corruption in the country is visible and expressed, sometimes the
generosity towards the corrupt is shown which is not acceptable in any
country.

And many people have gone so shameless that despite being convicted in
court, having been proved corrupt, having been sentenced for
imprisonment, while still serving in jail, they continue to glorify, take pride
and continue to elevate their status. Unless there is hatred towards filth in
the society, the consciousness for cleanliness does not arise, unless we
develop hatred towards the corrupt and corruption, until we relegate these
people to social shaming, such mentality will not change. And that's why we
need to be very aware of corruption and corrupt people.

Another point to highlight is rampant nepotism. And whenever I talk about
nepotism or dynasty, people think I am talking only in the context of politics.
Not at all. Unfortunately, it is being nourished in other Indian institutions as
well. Family bias Nepotism has gripped many of our institutions today. This
is sadly harming the immense talent pool of our country. The future
potential of my country is suffering. Those who are legitimate contenders of
these opportunities and are genuinely eligible get sidelined due to
nepotism. This is a good reason for corruption. Since they feel that they
stand no chance to avail opportunities as per norms, these potential and
deserving candidates resort to paying bribes to get a job. All of us have to
work hard on fighting Nepotism by becoming more aware and creating an
antipathy for this. Only such efforts can save our institutions and ingrain
ethical behaviour in our future generations. This is mandatory to ensure a
bright future of our institutions. Similarly, in politics too, family bias or
dynasty has done the most injustice to the country's strength. It becomes a
way to benefit only the family and has no connection towards the national
good.

And therefore, while remembering the Constitution of India, standing under
the tricolor from the ramparts of the Red Fort, I want to say with an open
heart to all the countrymen- let us all join hands for the purification and
cleansing of Indian politics and for the cleansing of all the institutions of
India, we have to liberate the country from this family mentality and move
towards taking the country forward on the basis of merit. It is more
imperative now than ever. Otherwise, everyone will carry heavy resentment
that s/he was deserving but could not succeed as there was no family
member vouching for them in the ecosystem. Such a mentality is not good
for any country.
Dear youth of my country, for your bright future, for your dreams, I seek
your support in the fight against nepotism. I want your support in the fight
against dynastic politics. I consider this as my constitutional responsibility.
The responsibility of a democracy. I believe in the power of words spoken
from the ramparts of this Red Fort. And hence I request you to support this
opportunity. We have noticed this in the accolades we received at the
sports world in the last few days. It’s not that we did not have such great
talent in the past. It is not that our sons and daughters, the youth of India,
are not achieving anything in the world of sports. But sadly they have been
pushed out due to the nepotism channel. The ones that qualified to reach
the competition in other countries were least bothered about winning
medals for the country. But when transparency was reinstated, selection
was on the merit of the sportsperson and the talent was honoured on the
playgrounds. It is a moment of pride today to see the tricolor flying high and
the national anthem reverberating at the stadiums globally.

One feels proud when there is freedom from dynasty and nepotism, and
such results come along. My dear countrymen, there are many challenges
no doubt. But if there are crores of problems before this country, then there
are also crores of solutions and I have faith in 130 crore countrymen. When
130 crore countrymen take one step ahead with a set goal and the
commitment to resolve, India moves 130 steps forward. We have to move
forward with this capability. This is the first dawn of the ‘Amrit Kaal’ and we
should not forget a single moment for the next 25 years. To live for the
motherland each day, every moment of time and every particle of life will be
our true tribute to the freedom fighters. Only then, the virtuous
remembrance of all those who contributed in taking the country to this point
in the last 75 years will be of use.

I urge the countrymen to start the ‘Amrit Kaal’ today by nurturing new
possibilities, realizing new resolutions and moving ahead with confidence.
The ‘Amrit Mahotsav’ of freedom has turned in the direction of ‘Amrit Kaal’
and, therefore, ‘Sabka Prayas’ is necessary in this ‘Amrit Kaal’. ‘Sabka
Prayas’ is going to yield this result. The spirit of Team India is going to take
the country forward. This Team India of 130 crore countrymen will realize
all the dreams by moving forward as a team. With this belief, speak with
me,

Jai Hind!

Jai Hind!

Jai Hind!

Bharat Mata ki – Jai!

Bharat Mata ki – Jai!

Bharat Mata ki – Jai!

Bharat Mata ki – Jai!

Vande Mataram!

2021,Narendra Modi,BJP,NA,English rendering of the text of PM’s address from the Red Fort on 75th Independence Day,Press Information Bureau,https://pib.gov.in/,"My dear countrymen!

Best wishes to all of you and those who love India and democracy from all
over the world on the occasion of the Amrit Mahotsav of freedom, the 75th
Independence Day.

Today, on the pious festival of the Amrit Mahotsav of freedom, the country
is bowing to all its freedom fighters and brave heroes who continue to
sacrifice themselves day and night in the defense of the nation. The
country is remembering every personality, including the revered Bapu, who
made freedom a mass movement, Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, who
sacrificed everything for the freedom, or great revolutionaries like Bhagat
Singh, Chandrasekhar Azad, Bismil and Ashfaqulla Khan; Rani of Jhansi
Lakshmibai, Queen Chennamma of Kittur or Rani Gaidinliu or the valour of
MatanginiHazra in Assam; the country's first Prime Minister Pandit Nehru ji,
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, who integrated the country into a united nation,
and Baba Saheb Ambedkar, who determined and paved the way for the
future direction of India. The country is indebted to all these great
personalities.

India is a land endowed with gems. I salute countless people from every
corner of India whose names don’t even figure in history, but who have built
this nation and have also taken it forward in every period.

India has fought for the motherland, culture and freedom for centuries. This
country never gave up the pain of slavery and the longing for freedom for
centuries. In the midst of victories and defeats, the aspiration of freedom
engraved in the mind was never diminished. Today is the time to bow down
to the leaders of all these struggles, the warriors of centuries of struggle
and they also deserve our reverence.

Our doctors, nurses, paramedical staff, sanitation staff, scientists engaged
in developing vaccines, millions of countrymen engaged with the spirit of
service during this Corona global pandemic also deserve praise from all of
us.
Today there are floods in some areas of the country, landslides have also
occurred. Some sad news also keeps coming. The hardships of the people
have increased in many areas. At such a time, both the Central and State
Governments are with them in complete readiness. Today, the young
athletes and our players who have brought laurels to India are also present
in this event.

Some are present and sitting here. Today, I appeal to all the countrymen,
those who are present here and all those who are present in this ceremony
from every corner of India, that in the honour of our players, for a few
moments let's salute them with resounding clapping applause and show
respect for their huge accomplishments.

Let us show our respect to the sports of India, youth of India and honour
the young Indians who bring laurels to the nation. Crores of countrymen are
showing respect to the youth of India, especially the athletes who brought
honour to India with a thunderous applause. I can be proud that they have
not only won our hearts today, but also inspired the youth of India and
future generations with their huge achievements.

My dear countrymen,

While we celebrate our freedom today, we cannot forget the pain of
partition that still pierces through the heart of all Indians. This has been one
of the biggest tragedies of the last century. After attaining freedom, these
people were forgotten too soon. Just yesterday India has taken an
emotional decision in their memory. We will henceforth commemorate
August 14 as “Partition Horrors Remembrance Day” in the memory of all
the victims of partition. Those who were subjected to inhuman
circumstances, suffered torturous treatment, they could not even receive a
dignified cremation. They must all remain alive and never get erased from
our memories. The decision of celebrating “Partition Horrors Remembrance
Day” on the 75th Independence Day is a befitting tribute from every Indian
to them.
My dear countrymen,

For the country moving on the path of progress and humanity in the entire
world, the Corona period came as a major challenge. Indians fought this
fight with great grit and patience. We had many challenges. Countrymen
performed extraordinarily in every field. It is due to the power of our
entrepreneurs and scientists that the country is not dependent on anyone
or any country for vaccines. Imagine for a ment, if we did not have the
vaccine. How long did it take to get polio vaccine?

It was extremely difficult to get vaccines during such a major crisis, with
pandemic plaguing the entire world. India might or might not have received
it and even if it had received the vaccine there was no certainty of getting
that in time. But today we can proudly say that the world's largest
vaccination programme is being run in our country. More than 54 crore
people have received the vaccine dose. Online systems like Cowin and
digital certificates are attracting the world today. The way India has kept the
stoves burning in the poor households by providing free food grains to 80
crore countrymen continuously for months during the pandemic is not only
astonishing to the world but also a matter of discussion. It is true that fewer
people have been infected in India as compared to other countries; it is
also true that in comparison to the population of other countries of the
world, we managed to save more citizens in India but it is not something to
be proud of! We cannot rest on these laurels. To say that there was no
challenge, will become a restrictive thought in the path of our own
development.

Our systems are insufficient compared to that of the rich countries of the
world, we do not have what the rich countries have. Moreover, we also
have a greater population compared to the other countries of the world.
And our lifestyle is also different. Despite all our efforts, we could not save
many people. So many children have been orphaned. This unbearable pain
is going to remain forever.
My dear countrymen,

There comes a time in the development journey of every country when the
country redefines itself afresh and pushes forward with new resolutions.
Today that time has arrived in the development journey of India. We should
not limit the occasion of 75 years of Indian independence to just one
ceremony. We must lay the groundwork for new resolutions and move
forward with new resolutions. Starting from here, the entire journey of the
next 25 years, when we celebrate the centenary of Indian independence,
marks the Amrit period of creation of a new India. The fulfillment of our
resolutions in this Amrit period will take us to the hundredth anniversary of
Indian independence with pride.

The goal of 'Amrit Kaal' is to ascend to new heights of prosperity for India
and the citizens of India. The goal of 'Amrit Kaal' is to create an India where
the level of facilities is not dividing the village and the city. The goal of
'Amrit Kaal' is to build an India where the government does not interfere
unnecessarily in the lives of citizens. The goal of 'Amrit Kaal' is to build an
India where there is world’s every modern infrastructure.

We should not be lesser than anyone. This is the resolve of the crores of
countrymen. But the resolve remains incomplete until it is not accompanied
by the extreme hard work and courage. Therefore, we have to realize all
our resolutions with hard work and courage, and these dreams and
resolutions are also for effective contribution to a safe and prosperous
world beyond our borders.

Amrit Kaal is of 25 years. But we don't have to wait for long to achieve our
goals. We have to start now. We don't have a moment to lose. This is the
right time. Our country also has to change and we as citizens have to
change ourselves too. We also have to adapt ourselves to the changing
era. We have started with the spirit of ‘SabkaSaath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka
Vishwas’. Today I am requesting from the ramparts of the Red Fort that
‘SabkaSaath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas’ and now ‘SabkaPrayas’ are
very important for the achievement of our goals. Crores of people are
getting the benefits of many schemes started in the last seven years. Every
poor of the country knows the importance of Ujjwala to Ayushman Bharat.
Today the speed of government schemes has increased and they are
achieving the desired goals. We have progressed much faster than before.
But it does not end here. We have to achieve saturation. All the villages
should have roads, all the households should have bank accounts, all the
beneficiaries should have Ayushman Bharat cards and all the eligible
persons should get the benefit of Ujjwala Yojana and should have gas
connections. We have to connect every entitled person with the
government’s insurance, pension and housing schemes. We have to move
ahead with a mindset of cent percent achievement. Till now, no thought
was given for our street vendors, who sell their goods on tracks, footpaths
and carts. All these colleagues are now being linked to the banking system
through the SVANidhi scheme.

Just as we have made electricity accessible to 100% households, and have
made authentic efforts to construct toilets in 100% households, similarly, we
now have to move ahead with the goal of achieving saturation of schemes,
and, for this, we do not have to keep a distant deadline. We have to make
our resolutions come true within a few years.

Today, our country is working with speed on the Har Ghar Jal Mission. I am
happy that in just two years of the Jal Jeevan Mission, more than four and
a half crore families have started getting water from taps. They have
started getting water from pipes. Receiving the blessings from crores of
mothers and sisters, is our true capital. The biggest advantage of this 100
percent accomplishment rate is that no one remains deprived of the
benefits of the government scheme. When the government operates with a
target to reach the person in the last line, only then there is no
discrimination and there is no scope for corruption.

My dear countrymen,

Providing nutrition to every poor person of the country is also a priority of
this government. Malnutrition and lack of essential nutrients in poor women
and poor children poses major obstacles in their development. In view of
this, it has been decided that the government will fortify the rice given to the
poor under its various schemes. Will give rice fortified with nutrition to the
poor. Be it the rice available at the ration shop, the rice provided to the
children in the mid-day meal, or the rice available through every scheme, it
shall be fortified by the year 2024.

My dear countrymen,

Today, the campaign to provide better health facilities to every poor in the
country is also going on at a fast pace. For this, important reforms have
also been made in medical education. Equal attention has been paid to
preventive healthcare. Simultaneously, there has been a substantial
increase in the number of medical seats in the country. Under the
Ayushman Bharat scheme, quality health services are being provided to
every village in the country. Affordable medicines are being made available
to the poor and middle class through Jan Aushadhi Yojana. So far, more
than 75 thousand Health and Wellness centers have been set up. At the
block level too, modern health infrastructure is being exclusively set up on
a network of good hospitals and modern labs. Very soon thousands of
hospitals in the country will also have their own oxygen plants.

My dear countrymen,

To take India to new heights in the 21st century, the optimal utilisation of
India's potential is the need of the hour.

This is extremely important. For this, we need to provide hand holding to
the backward categories and sectors. Alongwith the concern of fulfilling the
basic needs, reservation is being ensured for the Dalits, Backward classes,
Adivasis and the poor people from general category. More recently, in the
field of medical education, reservation has also been ensured for the OBC
category in the All India quota. By formulating a law in Parliament, the right
to make their own list of OBC has been given to the states.
My dear countrymen,

Just as we are making sure that no person or no class should be left
behind in the development journey of society, similarly no part of the
country, no corner of the country should be left behind. Development
should be all-round, development should be all-pervasive, development
should be all-inclusive. We are now accelerating the efforts that have been
made in the last seven years to bring forward such backward areas of the
country. Be it the eastern India, the North-east, Jammu-Kashmir, Ladakh
including the entire Himalayan region, be it our coastal belt or the tribal
region, these regions are going to turn into a major foundation for India's
development in future, India's development journey.

Today a new history of connectivity is being written in the North-East. This
is a connectivity of both the hearts and the infrastructure. Very soon the
work of connecting all the state capitals of the North-East with rail service is
going to be completed. Under the Act-East Policy, today North-East,
Bangladesh, Myanmar and South-East Asia are also being connected. Due
to the efforts made in the past years, now the enthusiasm for the creation of
Shreshtha Bharat and long lasting peace in the North-East has increased
manifold.

There is a huge potential in the fields of tourism, adventure sports, organic
farming, herbal medicine, and oil palm in the North East. We have to fully
harness this potential and make it a part of the development journey of the
country. And we have to complete this work within a few decades of the
'Amrit kaal'. Giving a fair opportunity to the capabilities of all is the true spirit
of democracy. Be it Jammu or Kashmir, the balance of development is now
visible on the ground.

The Delimitation Commission has been constituted in Jammu and Kashmir
and preparations are also going on for the assembly elections. Ladakh has
also progressed towards its limitless possibilities of development. On one
hand Ladakh is witnessing the creation of modern infrastructure, while on
the other hand Sindhu Central University is also making Ladakh a center of
higher education.

In this decade of the 21st century, India will further accelerate its efforts
towards the Blue Economy. Along with aquaculture, we have to take full
advantage of the new possibilities that are emerging in the cultivation of
seaweed. The Deep Ocean Mission is the result of our ambition to explore
the unlimited possibilities of the ocean. The mineral wealth which is hidden
in the sea, the thermal energy which is in the sea water, can give new
heights to the development of the country.

We have also awakened the aspirations of the districts of the country
believed to have been left behind. Priority is being given to schemes
related to education, health, nutrition, roads and employment in more than
110 aspirational districts in the country. Many of these districts are in our
tribal areas. We have created a spirit of healthy competition for
development among these districts. There is a strong competition going on
in that direction so that these aspirational districts are at par with other
districts of India.

My dear countrymen,

Capitalism and socialism are discussed a lot in the world of economics, but
India also emphasizes cooperativism. Cooperativism is also compatible
with our traditions and values. Cooperativism, in which the collective power
of the masses becomes the driving force of the economy, is important for
the country's grassroots level economy. Co-operatives are not just a
system with a network of laws and rules, but co-operative is a spirit, culture,
and a mindset of collective growth. We have taken steps to empower them
by forming a separate ministry. We have taken this step to empower the
cooperative sector in the states.

My dear countrymen,
We will have to put all our efforts to build a new economy in the villages in
this decade. Today we can see our villages changing rapidly. In the last few
years, our government has provided roads and electricity to the villages.
Now these villages have been strengthened with optical fibernetwork data
and the Internet. Digital entrepreneurs are emerging in the villages also.
The more than eight crore sisters in the villages, who are associated with
Self-Help Groups, design top-end products. Now the government will also
prepare an e-commerce platform for their products so that get a big market
in our country and abroad. Today, when the country is moving forward with
the mantra of Vocal for Local, this digital platform will connect the products
of women self-help groups with people across the length and breadth of the
country as well as internationally. Their horizon shall thus get enhanced.

During Corona, the country has witnessed the power of technology, as well
as the commitment and capabilities of our scientists. The scientists of our
country are working very diligently and strategically across the expanse of
​the country. Now the time has come for us to integrate the capabilities of
 scientists and their suggestions in our agriculture sector as well. Now we
 cannot wait any longer. We have to leverage this strength. This will go a
 long way in increasing the production of fruits, vegetables and grains along
 with giving food security to the country. Thus we shall catapult ourselves
 strongly into the world orbit.

Amongst these concerted efforts, we need to take cognizance of a major
challenge posed in our agriculture sector. Challenge of shrinking of land of
villagers which is due to immense rise in population, and smaller land
holdings due to the divisions happening in the family. Farming land has
shrunk alarmingly. More than 80 percent of the farmers of the country are
those who have less than two hectares of land. If we see, 80 out of 100
farmers have less than two hectares of land i.e. the farmers of our country
are practically in the small farmer category. Unfortunately, this segment
remained eliminated from the benefits in our yesteryear’s policies. They did
not get their due importance. Now, keeping in mind these small farmers in
the country, agricultural reforms are being undertaken, and critical
decisions are being taken to benefit them.
Whether the improvement in the crop insurance scheme or important
decision of increasing the MSP by one and a half times; a system to
provide loans from banks at cheaper rates through Kisan Credit Card;
taking the schemes related to solar power to the farm, formulate a Farmer
Producer Organization. All these efforts will increase the power of the small
farmer. In the coming times, a campaign will also be launched to create a
warehouse facility up to the block level.

Keeping in mind the small expenses of every small farmer, PM
KisanSamman Nidhi Yojana is being run. So far, more than 1.5 lakh crores
have been deposited directly into the bank accounts of more than ten crore
farmer families. The small farmer is now our resolve and mantra for us. The
small farmer becomes the country's pride.... the small farmer becomes the
nation's pride. This is our dream. In the coming years, we will have to
increase the collective power of the small farmers of the country. New
facilities have to be provided.

Today, Kisan Rail is plying on more than 70 rail routes of the country. Kisan
Rail can help small farmers with this modern facility to reach far flung areas
on a low cost of produce and transportation. Several products like
Kamalam, Shahi litchi, BhutJolokiachillis, black rice or turmeric are being
exported to different countries of the world. Today, the country feels
delighted when the aroma of these products produced in the soil of India
reaches different countries of the world. Today the world is developing a
taste for the vegetables and food grains grown in the fields of India.

My dear countrymen,

Swamitva Yojana is an example of one of the initiatives taken to boost the
capabilities of the villages today. We all know what happens to the price of
land in villages. They do not get any loan from the banks on the basis of
land, despite being the owners of the land because no work had been done
in terms of documents of rural land for several years. People do not have
this system. The Swamitva scheme attempted to change this situation.
Today every village, every house, every land is being mapped through
drones. The data and property papers of village lands are being uploaded
online. With this, not only the disputes related to land in the villages are
being ended, but a system has also been created for the people of the
village to get loans easily from the banks. The lands of village poor should
be the foundation for development rather than disputes. And the country is
moving in the same direction today.

My dear countrymen,

When Swami Vivekananda used to talk about the future of India, when he
used to see the magnificence of Mother Bharati in front of his eyes, he
used to say – Try to look into the past as far as possible. Drink the water of
the ever new spring flowing back there, and after that, look ahead. Go
ahead and make India brighter, greater & better than ever. In this 75th year
of independence, it is our duty to move forward believing in the immense
potential of the country. We have to work together for new generation
infrastructure; we have to work together for world class manufacturing; we
have to work together for cutting edge innovations; we have to work
together for new age technology.

My dear countrymen,

The foundation of progress in the modern world lies on modern
infrastructure. It also fulfills the needs and aspirations of the middle class.
Weak infrastructure derails the pace of development and the urban middle
class also suffers.

We have to work together for next generation infrastructure, for world class
manufacturing, for cutting edge innovation and for New Age technology.

My dear countrymen,

Realizing this need, the country has demonstrated extraordinary speed and
scale in every field from the seas, land to the skies. Rapid progress is
underway whether it is development of new waterways or connecting new
places with seaplanes. Indian Railways is also rapidly adapting to its
modern avatar. The country has resolved to celebrate the Amrit Mahotsav
of independence. You would know that we have decided to celebrate this
Amrit Mahotsav of independence for 75 weeks. It started from 12th March
and will continue till 15th August, 2023. We have to move forward with new
enthusiasm and, therefore, the country has made a very important
decision.

During these 75 weeks of the Amrit Mahotsav of Independence, 75 Vande
Bharat trains will connect every corner of the country. The pace at which
new airports are being built in the country and the UDAN scheme
connecting remote areas is unprecedented. We can see how better air
connectivity gives new flights to people's dreams.

My dear countrymen,

Along with modern infrastructure, there is a great need for adopting a
holistic and integrated approach in infrastructure construction. In the near
future, we are going to launch the National Master Plan of Prime Minister
‘Gati Shakti’ which will be a huge scheme and fulfill the dreams of crores of
countrymen. This scheme of more than 100 lakh crores rupees will result in
new employment opportunities for lakhs of youth.

Gati Shakti will be a National Infrastructure Master Plan for our country
which will lay the foundation of holistic Infrastructure and will lead to an
integrated and holistic pathway to our economy. Right now, there is no
coordination between our means of transport. Gati Shakti will break the
silos, and will remove all these obstacles. This will reduce the travel time
for the common man and the productivity of our industry will also increase.
Gati Shakti will also go a long way in making our local manufacturers
globally competitive and this will also develop new possibilities for the
creation of future economic zones. In this decade, the power of speed will
form the basis of India's transformation.
My dear countrymen,

India will have to increase both its manufacturing and exports while moving
ahead on the path of development.

My dear countrymen,

Treading ahead on the path of development, India will have to augment
both its manufacturing and exports. You have witnessed, just a few days
ago, India launched its first indigenous Aircraft Carrier INS Vikrant for trial
in the sea. Today India is making its own indigenous fighter aircraft, its own
submarine. Gaganyaan is also slated to hoist India's flag in space. This
itself is evidential of our immense capabilities in indigenous manufacturing.

The country has also announced Production Linked Incentive to
consolidate our Make in India campaign in the wake of the new economic
conditions that have emerged due to Corona. The electronic manufacturing
sector stands as an example of the change that is enforced through this
scheme. Seven years ago we used to import mobile phones worth about
eight billion dollars. However, now the import has reduced considerably,
and today we are also exporting mobile phones worth three billion dollars.

Today, when our manufacturing sector is gaining momentum, our focus
should be that whatever we make in India should be of highest quality
standards so that we sustain in the global competition. Rather, if possible
we should aim at going a step ahead and take proactive steps to prepare
ourselves for the global market. We have to target that. I want to say
emphatically to all the manufacturers of the country, that you should never
forget that the product you sell overseas is not just a product made by your
company, it is the identity of our nation, India's prestige and the faith of all
the citizens of our country.

My dear countrymen
That is why I tell all our manufacturers that each of your products is a brand
ambassador of India. When someone will buy and use your product, the
customer should say with pride- now “This is Made in India”. That's the
mindset we need. You all should now aspire to win over the global market.
The government is fully with you in realising this dream.

My dear countrymen,

Today, several new start-ups are being formed in different sectors of the
country and even in smaller tier 2, tier 3 cities of the country. They also
have a big role to play in getting entry of their Indian products into the
inter-state market.The government stands with all its might, with these
start-ups. Whether it is giving them financial help, cash discounts, rules
simplification for them, the government is fully with them. We have seen
that thousands of new start-ups have emerged in this difficult period of
Corona. They are moving forward with great success. Yesteryear’s
start-ups are becoming today's unicorns. Their market value is reaching
thousands of crores of rupees.

These are new types of wealth creators in our country today. They are
standing on their feet with the power of their unique ideas, moving ahead
and walking with the dream of conquering the world. They are new kinds of
wealth creators. They are moving by the force of their unique ideas and a
dream to win over the world. In this decade, we need to relentlessly work
towards making India's Startups and the Startup Ecosystem the best in the
whole world.

My countrymen,

Political will is needed to bring about major changes and reforms. Today
the world is witnessing that there is no dearth of political will in India. Good
and smart governance is required to implement the reforms. Today the
world is also a witness to how India is writing a new chapter of governance
here. In this decade of 'Amrit Kaal', we will give priority to Next Generation
reforms... We will ensure that all the facilities like service delivery should
reach citizens up to the last mile; it should reach the last person
seamlessly, without hesitation or any kind of difficulty. For the overall
development of the country, unnecessary interference by the government
and the government processes in the lives of the people has to be ended.

Earlier, the government itself was on the driving seat. This might have been
the demand of that time. But now the time has changed. In the last seven
years, efforts have also intensified in the country to liberate the people of
the country from the web of unnecessary laws and procedures. Till now
hundreds of old laws of the country have been abolished. Even during this
period of Corona pandemic, the government has abolished more than
15,000 compliances. Now you see, you might have experienced a lot of
hassles and paperwork for a small government work. That has been the
situation so far. We have ended 15,000 compliances.

Just imagine.....I want to give you an example. A law has been in place in
India for over 200 years, 200 years i.e. even before 1857. As per this law,
the citizens of the country did not have the right to create maps. Now
imagine, it was in place since 1857. If you want to create a map, then seek
permission from the government, if you want to print the map in a book,
then seek permission from the government; there is a provision for arrest if
the map is lost. Nowadays every phone has a Map app. Satellites have so
much power! Then how will we take the country forward with a burden of
such laws? It is very important to get rid of this burden of compliances. We
have abolished several regulations in various sectors like mapping, space,
information technology and BPO.

My dear countrymen,

Freedom from the clutches of unnecessary laws is very important for both
Ease of Living as well as Ease of Doing Business. Our country's industries
and businesses are experiencing this change today.

Today dozens of labor laws have been subsumed into just 4 codes. Tax
related arrangements have also been made easy and become faceless
now. We will have to work together so that such reforms are not limited to
the government only, but percolate down to gram panchayats, municipal
corporations and municipalities. I am calling upon, making an earnest
appeal to all the central and state departments to launch a campaign to
review the existing rules and procedures. We have to get rid of every rule,
every process which has become a hindrance and a burden for the people
of the country. I know what has accumulated in 70-75 years will not go
away in a day or in a year. But if we start working with a purpose, we will
definitely be able to do this.

My dear countrymen,

Keeping this in mind, the government has also started Mission Karmayogi
and Capacity Building Commission to increase people-centric approach in
bureaucracy and improve their efficiency.

My dear countrymen,

Our education, education system, education tradition has a great role in
preparing the youth, who are possessed with skill and ability, and who have
the spirit to do something for the country. Today the country also has a new
National Education Policy to meet the needs of the 21st century. Now our
children will neither stop due to lack of skills nor will they be bound by
language barriers. Unfortunately, there is a massive divide in our country
regarding language. We have tied a huge talent of the country to the cage
of language. One can find promising people in their mother tongue. If
people from the vernacular medium come forward, their self-confidence will
grow. Justice will be done to the potential of the poor children when they
will become professionals by studying in their mother tongue.

I believe that language is the instrument of the fight against poverty in the
new National Education Policy. This new National Education Policy is also
going to be a great tool to fight against poverty in a way. The basis of
winning the war against poverty is also the education, prestige and
importance of the vernacular language. The country has seen this in the
playground... and we are experiencing that language has not become a
barrier and as a result we have seen that the youth are playing and
blossoming. Now the same thing will happen in other fields of life as well.

Another special feature of the new National Education Policy is that sports
has been made a part of mainstream education instead of extra-curricular.
Sports is also one of the most effective means of pursuing life. It is very
important to have sports in life for perfection in life. There was a time when
sports was not considered mainstream. Parents also considered indulging
in sports as wastage of life. Now, there is a new awareness about fitness
and sports. We have seen and felt this in the olympics. This change is a big
turning point for us. That is why, we need to speed up and expand the
campaign that is going on in the country for infusing talent, technology and
professionalism in sports.

It is a matter of pride for the country that our daughters are performing in an
unprecedented manner in the fields of education, sports, Boards results or
olympics. Today daughters are raring to occupy their place. We have to
ensure that women have equal partnership in every career and workspace.
We have to ensure that they feel safe from roads to the workplace and
everywhere. There should be a feeling of respect for them and in this, the
government, administration, police and justice system will have to perform
their duty cent percent. We have to make this resolution , the resolution of
the 75 years of Independence.

Today I am sharing good news with the countrymen. I used to get lakhs of
messages from our daughters that they want to study in the Sainik Schools.
The Doors of the schools should be opened for them. We did a pilot project
in the Sainik School of Mizoram two-two and half years ago by giving
admission to our daughters. Now the Government has decided that all the
Sainik Schools will be open for the girls. Daughter too will study in all the
Sainik Schools of the Country.

Environmental security is getting the same importance in the world as
national security.Today India is a vibrant voice of environmental security,
whether it is biodiversity or land neutrality, climate change or waste
recycling, organic farming or biogas, energy conservation or clean energy
transition. India’s efforts in environment are giving results today. Increase in
forest cover, number of national parks, increase in number of tigers and
Asiatic lions are a matter of happiness for the countrymen.

Among all these successes one truth needs to be understood. India is not
yet energy independent. India today spends more than 12 lakh crore
rupees annually for importing energy. For India's progress and to build a
self-reliant India, India's energy independence is the need of the hour!
Therefore today, India has to make a resolution to make India energy
independent before the completion of 100 years of independence and our
roadmap is very clear for the same. It should be a gas based economy.
There should be a network of CNG & PNG across the country. There
should be a target of 20 percent ethanol blending. India is moving ahead
with a set goal. India has also made a move towards Electric Mobility and
the work on 100% electrification of Railways is also progressing at a fast
pace. Indian Railways has set a target of becoming Net Zero Carbon
Emitter by 2030. Besides these efforts, the country is also emphasizing on
Mission Circular Economy. Our Vehicle Scrap Policy is a great example of
the same. Today, India is the only country in the group of G-20 countries,
which is moving fast towards achieving its climate goals.

 India has set a target of 450 GW of renewable energy by the end of this
decade - 450 GW by 2030. Of this, the target of 100 GW has been
achieved by India ahead of schedule. These efforts are also instilling
confidence in the world. The formation of the International Solar Alliance
on the Global State is a great example of the same.

Of every effort being made by India today, the thing that is going to help
India with a quantum leap in terms of climate is the field of ​Green
Hydrogen. To achieve the goal of Green Hydrogen, I am announcing the
National Hydrogen Mission today with this tricolour as a witness. We have
to make India a Global Hub for Green Hydrogen Production and Export in
the 'Amrit Kaal'. This will not only help India to make a new progress in the
field of energy self-reliance but will also become a new inspiration for Clean
Energy Transition all over the world. New opportunities from Green Growth
to Green Job are opening up today for our start-ups & youth.

My dear countrymen,

Today, the 21st century India has the ability to create and achieve big goals
as well. Today India is also solving those subject areas, which were
hanging fires for decades and centuries. Be it a historic decision to
abrogate Article 370, introduction of GST, a system that frees the country
from the web of taxes, a decision regarding 'One Rank-One Pension' for
our military friends, a peaceful solution to the Ram Janmabhoomi issue, we
have seen it come true in a few years

India’s willpower is realizing all the resolutions whether it is the Bru-Reang
agreement in Tripura after decades, constitutional status to the OBC
commission or the BDC and DDC elections in Jammu and Kashmir for the
first time since independence.

Even in this period of Corona, record foreign investment is coming to India.
India's foreign exchange reserves are also at an all-time high. India has
also given the message of the might of New India to the enemies of the
country by carrying out surgical and air strikes. It shows that India is
changing. India can change. India can take the toughest decisions and it
does not hesitate and stop in taking even the toughest decisions.

My dear countrymen,

The nature of global relations has changed after the Second World War.
There is a possibility of a new world order post Corona. The world has seen
and appreciated India's efforts during Corona. Today the world is looking at
India from a new perspective. There are two important aspects of this
perception -- one is terrorism and the other is expansionism. India is
fighting both these challenges and is also responding strongly in a
restrained manner. Our defense preparedness has to be equally strong if
India has to fulfil its obligations properly.

We are making constant efforts to provide new opportunities to our
hardworking entrepreneurs and to encourage Indian companies to make
the country self-reliant in the field of defence. I assure the country that we
will leave no stone unturned to strengthen the hands of our forces engaged
in the defense of the country.

My dear countrymen,

Today is also the birth anniversary of the great thinker of the country, Sri
Aurobindo. His 150th birth anniversary will be celebrated in 2022. Sri
Aurobindo was a visionary of India's bright future. He used to say that we
have to be as powerful as we were never before. We have to change our
habits. We have to re-awaken ourselves. These words of Sri Aurobindo
remind us of our duties. We also have to think about what we are giving to
the country as a citizen and as a society. We have always given importance
to rights. They were needed during that period, but now we have to make
duties paramount. Everybody will have to contribute in fulfilling the
resolutions of the country. Every citizen will have to own this up.

Our country has initiated a campaign of water conservation, so it is our duty
to include saving water in our habits. If the country is emphasizing on digital
transactions, then it is also our duty to do minimum cash transactions. The
country has started the campaign of Local for Vocal, so it is our duty to buy
as many local products as possible. To strengthen our vision of a
plastic-free India of the country, it is our duty to completely stop the use of
single use plastic. It is our duty not to throw dirt in our rivers, keep our sea
shores clean. We also have to take the Swachh Bharat Mission to another
new level.

Today, when the country is celebrating the Amrit Mahotsav on the occasion
of 75 years of independence, it is the duty of all of us to join this event,
participate in it enthusiastically, and keep kindling our resolutions again and
again. Keeping freedom struggle in mind, whatever little you do…
whatever… will be pure like a drop of nectar, and this Amrit Kumbh made
by the pure efforts of many Indians will inspire the entire nation for years to
come.

My dear countrymen,

I am not a fortune teller, I believe in action. I have faith in the youth of my
country, I trust the sisters of the country, the daughters of the country, the
farmers of the country, and the professionals of the country. This ‘CAN DO’
generation can achieve every goal imaginable.

I believe that in 2047, on the occasion of celebrating 100 years of
independence… whoever will be the Prime Minister… whoever will be the
Prime Minister after 25 years from today, when he will be unfurling the
flag… I say this with confidence today that he or she shall be chronicling
those accomplishments in his speech about which the country has taken a
vow today... This is my firm belief of victory.

Today whatever I am speaking of in the form of a resolution, whoever hoists
the flag after 25 years, shall be speaking of the same in the form of
accomplishments. The country would be singing its glory in the form of
these accomplishments. Youth of the country of today, shall also see at that
time how the country has achieved this glory.

In the 21st century, no obstacle can stop us from fulfilling the dreams and
aspirations of India. Our strength is our vitality, our strength is our solidarity,
our vitality is the spirit of nation first - always first. This is the time for
shared dreams, this is the time for shared resolve, this is the time for
shared efforts... and this is the time to move towards victory.

And so I say once again-

This is the time,
This is the time.. the right time!

India's precious time!

This is the time, the right time! India's precious time!

The power of countless arms,

The power of countless arms,

There is patriotism everywhere!

There is the power of innumerable arms, there is patriotism everywhere…

Come, rise and unfurl the Tricolour!

Come, rise and unfurl the Tricolour!

Turn the fate of India,

Turn the fate of India,

This is the time, the right time! India's precious time!

There is nothing..

There is nothing you cannot do,

There is nothing you cannot achieve,

You Rise...

You Rise and Begin,

Recognize your abilities,
Recognize your abilities,

Understand all your duties,

Understand all your duties!

This is the time, the right time! India's precious time!

When the country completes 100 years of independence, the goals of the
countrymen must be turned into reality; that is my desire. With my best
wishes, I once again congratulate all the countrymen on the 75th
Independence Day! Say aloud with your fists up -

Jai Hind,

Jai Hind,

Jai Hind!

Vande Matram,

Vande Matram,

Vande Matram!

Long live Mother India,

Long live Mother India,

Long live Mother India!

Thanks a lot!"
2020,Narendra Modi,BJP,NA,"English rendering of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s address to the Nation from the ramparts of the Red Fort on the 74th Independence Day- August 15, 2020",Press Information Bureau,https://pib.gov.in/,"My dear countrymen,

Congratulations and many best wishes to all the countrymen on this
auspicious occasion of independence.

Today, we are able to live in an independent India because of the sacrifices
of millions of sons and daughters of Mother India. This is an occasion to
pay tribute to the freedom fighters, martyrs and brave souls and their spirit
and dedication to free Mother India.

The valiant soldiers of our armed forces, our paramilitary forces, our police
personnel and our security forces- everyone is engaged in protecting
Mother India. They are engaged in safeguarding the common man. Today
is the day to remember their sacrifices and penance sincerely and
wholeheartedly.

There is another name: Aurobindo Ghose. Today is the birth anniversary of
Aurobindo Ghose, who tread the path from being a revolutionary to
spirituality. Let us seek his blessings so that we can fulfil his as well as our
vision.

We are passing through an extraordinary situation. Today, children- the
bright future of India- are not in front of me. Why? It is because Corona has
stopped everyone. In this period of corona, I salute millions of corona
warriors- doctors, nurses, sanitation workers, ambulance drivers and so
on-who all should I count.

I salute all the corona warriors, who for a long time have adhered to the
mantra of ‘सेवा परमो धर्म’ i.e. service is the best religion and have served the
children of Mother India with complete dedication.

In the period of corona, many of our brothers and sisters have been
affected by this pandemic; many families have been affected; many have
also lost their lives. I express my condolences to all such families, and I
believe the indomitable will power and determination of 130 crore
countrymen will make us win over Corona and we shall definitely win.

I know that recently we have been passing through a number of crises.
Floods, especially in the north-east, eastern India, south India and some
parts of western India; landslides in many areas; people have had to face
many problems. Many people have lost their lives. I also express my
condolences to those families.

And the nation stands in solidarity with the state governments in these days
of crisis. No stone is being left unturned by either the state or central
government to provide relief measures to the needy.

My dear Countrymen, Independence Day is a festival to celebrate freedom.
It is an occasion to enthuse new energy by remembering our freedom
fighters. This day is a harbinger of new inspirations. It reignites new fervour,
exuberance and enthusiasm. And in times like now, it becomes even more
imperative for us to be determined. It is an auspicious day because when
we meet again next year to celebrate, we shall be entering into the 75
years of our free existence. This is a momentous occasion. Today, all of us
130 crores Indians have to make significant pledges for the coming two
years. And when we complete the 75 years of our freedom, we will be able
celebrate the redemption of those pledges .

My dear countrymen, our forefathers fought for this freedom with extreme
commitment, utmost integrity, sincere penance, renunciation and sacrifice;
we should never forget the way they laid their lives for Mother India. We
should never forget that during this long and dark ages of slavery, not even
a moment was lost when they were not moved by the desire for freedom.
There insn't a countryman who did not put his best foot forward aspiring to
break free the nation from the shackles of slavery, by waging a war and
making any sacrifice possible to bring this day. Many sacrificed their youth
in jails. Many left behind their life's dreams and embraced the gallows. I
salute these revered martyrs who offered themselves as an oblation.
Indeed amazing! On the one side, the country witnessed a phase of mass
movements and on the other side the resounding voice of armed revolt.

Under the leadership of Pujya Bapu, the great national awakening
accompanied by mass movements, gave new impetus to the struggle for
freedom. And so today we are blessed to be able to celebrate our
Independence Day with such fervour.

During this freedom struggle, several efforts were made to douse the fire of
revolt and throttle the soul and spirit of our motherland. Many attempts
were made to ruin the Indian culture, tradition, customs and heritage.
Running across centuries, that was the period of SAAM DAAM DAND
BHED (either by hook or crook) – and all this was at its peak. Many came
here with the innate belief that they have come to reign the world for
eternity (yaavat chandra diwakaro-till sun and moon exist). But the strong
determination to be freed beat such ambitions to dust. They believed that
India was a divided lot due to the existence of multiple identities, nobilities,
languages and dialects, cuisines, costumes and culture. They labored
under the misunderstanding that a country of so many diversities can never
stand up as one against any force. But they could not recognize the soul
and pulse of the country, that life force, that chord which binds us together.
And when this force came out with full vigour in the fight for freedom, India
succeeded in throwing away the shackles of slavery .

We are aware of the fact that that was the regime when propagators of
expansionism spread across geographies and attained supremacy and
power, but the freedom movement of India inspired many across the globe
to stand against these forces. India became a pillar and ignited the fire of
freedom struggle all over the world.

And those, who were involved in the blind race of expansionism, threw the
World into two World wars, destroyed humanity, ruined lives and wrecked
the globe to achieve their designs.
But even during such a period, even in the midst of the destructive war,
India did not abandon its urge for freedom; neither was it found lacking, nor
did it lower its guard.

Whenever there was a need, the country has been making sacrifices,
enduring sufferings and leading people’s movements. India’s battle created
an atmosphere for freedom in the world. And the change that the power of
India brought in the world, it became a challenge for expansionism. History
can never deny it.

My dear countrymen,

In the entire World, in its war for independence, India kept marching with
its head high with its strength of unity, collectivity, the resolve for its bright
future, its commitment and inspiration.

My dear countrymen,

In the midst of the Corona pandemic, 130 crore Indians pledged
themselves to become self-reliant. Today self-reliance is etched in the mind
of every Indian. We are also witnessing the realization of that dream of
Self-Reliant India (“AatmaNirbharBharat”). “Self-reliant India” is not just a
word, it has become a mantra for 130 crore countrymen.

When I talk of self-reliance, all of us who are now above the age group of
25-30 years surely recall how we were goaded by our parents and elders to
become self-reliant as we attained an age of 20 - 21. Every family expects
its children of 20-21 years to be self-reliant. As we are just one step away
from the 75th Anniversary of Independence, it is essential for a country like
India to stand own its own, and to become self reliant. What is necessary
for a family is also essential for a country. I have full faith that India will
realize this dream. And the reason for this is the strength of my country’s
citizens in which I have full faith, I am proud of their talent, I have
confidence in our youth and the country’s unparalleled women power. I
have faith in the thinking, in the approach of India. And history is witness
that whenever India resolves to do something, it does it.

Therefore, when we talk about self-reliance, it arouses not only curiosity all
over the World but also expectations from India. Therefore, it is imperative
that we make ourselves capable for realization of that expectation. It is very
essential to prepare ourselves.

A large country like India is full of energy of youth power. The first condition
for a self-reliant India is self-confidence which is the foundation of
self-reliance.

And this has the power to give a new vision and a new energy to
development.

India has always followed the adage - ‘Whole world is one family’. Veda
says ‘वसध ु व
            ै कुटुम्बकम ्’ and Vinoba ji used to say ‘‘जय जगत’ i.e. hail the
world. Therefore, the world is one family for us. So, alongside financial
development, mankind and humanity should also get importance. And we
follow this dictum.

Today the world is interconnected and inter-dependent. So, it is the need of
the hour that a vast country like India should increase its contribution to the
world economy. It is also India’s duty towards world welfare. If India wants
to increase its contribution then she herself will have to be empowered; she
will have to be self-reliant or ‘AatmaNirbhar’. We must make ourselves
capable of contributing towards world welfare. If our roots are strong and
we are capable enough, we will be able to take steps towards world
welfare.

Our country has plenty of natural resources. It is the need of the hour that
we start the value addition of these natural resources and human
resources; and to take the country to new heights. How long shall we
continue to export raw material to the world? How long will the process of
exporting raw material and importing finished goods continue? So, we will
have to be self-reliant. We will have to resort to value addition of our
capabilities as per the world’s requirements. It is our responsibility. We want
to move ahead in the field of value addition to contribute to world welfare.
Similarly, there was a time when we used to import wheat from abroad; but
our farmers have done a wonderful job. And now India is self-reliant in the
agricultural sector. Today India’s farmers not only supply the food grains for
the citizens of India but India is also in such a position that it provides food
grains to the other countries in need.

Though this is our strength- the strength of self-reliance in agriculture-
value addition is also necessary in this sector. Our farm sector needs to
evolve in line with requirements of world; Value addition is required for our
farm sector

Today, the country is taking several new initiatives. You see, we have
opened up the space sector. The youth of the country is getting
opportunities. We have liberated the agriculture sector from the shackles of
laws and have tried to make it self-reliant. When India becomes powerful in
the space sector, neighbouring countries also get its benefits. If we become
powerful in the energy sector, India can help those countries that want to
dispel their darkness. When the country’s health infrastructure becomes
self-reliant, then India becomes a preferred country as a destination for
health tourism. Therefore, it is necessary to see to it that ‘Make in India’
products get appreciated in the world. History is a witness to the fact that
there was a time when the products made in our country by our skilled
manpower were used to get appreciated all over the world.

When we talk about becoming self-reliant, then we do not merely refer to
decreasing the import demands. When we talk of self-reliance, it is about
our skills, our human resources. When we start sourcing things from
abroad, then our capabilities start depleting and consequently, it gets
completely destroyed over generations. We need to preserve it and
enhance that caliber of ours. We need to accentuate our skills, our
creativity and with that we need to touch new heights. We need to
strengthen skill development for a self-reliant India, for improving our
competency.

My dear citizens, I know that when I talk about becoming self-reliant then
people raise several doubts. I do accept that there are millions of
challenges while we travel on the path of becoming self-reliant and these
challenges increase further in a competitive world. We should realise that
for the millions of challenges we face, our nation has the capability to
provide billions of solutions. My countrymen are there with the capability to
resolve the issues.

You can see that in the challenging times of Corona, we were in need of
many items which we needed to import but the world was unable to provide
them. The youth of our nation, our entrepreneurs, the industry accepted the
challenge. The nation that never manufactured N-95, started doing so. We
started production of PPE which was not being produced before, similarly
we started producing ventilators in India, which were not being made here
before. We are not only able to meet our own requirements, but now also
become strong enough to export to the world. We can very well see how a
self-reliant India can help the world. Therefore it is also the duty of India to
work for the welfare of the world.

Enough is enough. What should be the mind-set of independent India? The
mind-set of independent India should be ‘Vocal for Local’. We should take
pride in our local products. If we do not praise and support our indigenous
products, then how will they get an opportunity to flourish and improve, how
will they gain strength? Come, let’s pledge that as we move towards the
75th year of our independence, we shall adopt the talisman of ‘Vocal for
Local’ and together let's strengthen ourselves.

My dear Countrymen, we have clearly seen how our nation can do
wonders, how it progresses. Who could have imagined that lakhs and
crores of money would be directly transferred to the Jan-Dhan accounts of
the poor? Who could have imagined that so many changes would be made
in the APMC Act for the welfare of farmers? Who could have thought that
the farmers who were living under the Damocles’ sword of the Essential
Commodities Act, would be freed of it after so many years? Could we have
imagined that the space sector would be laid open for the youth of our
nation? Today we are witnessing that National Education Policy, One
Nation-One Ration Card, One Nation-One Grid, One Nation-One Tax,
Insolvency and Bank Bankruptcy Code and the effort for merger of banks-
all these things have become the reality of nation, fact for our nation.

The world is looking at the outcomes of the reforms that are taking place in
India in these times. The world is closely observing the reforms we are
bringing one after another, one linked to another. As a result of this Foreign
Direct Investment (FDI) in India has broken all its previous records last
year.

Last year, there has been an 18% increase in FDI in India. So, even during
the corona pandemic, top companies of the world are turning to India. This
confidence hasn’t been created just like that. The world didn’t get
fascinated with India without a reason. This confidence has grown because
of the hard work put in by India in the field of its policies, democracy and
strengthening the foundation of its economy.

Today many businesses of the world are viewing India as the hub of the
supply chain. So now, we have to move ahead with the mantra of ‘Make for
World’ alongside ‘Make in India’.

Try to recall what happened recently and take pride in the capabilities of
130 crore countrymen. During this corona pandemic, there were cyclones
in the east and the west coasts of India, umpteen number of people died
because of lightning & landslides, and earthquakes of small intensity were
felt time and again. As if these were not enough, swarms of locust created
havoc for our farmers. A series of adversities struck one after another. Yet,
the country didn’t lose confidence and continued to move forward with
self-confidence.
Today, it is our priority to pull the people and the economy of our country
out of this corona pandemic. The National Infrastructure Pipeline Project
will play an important role in this endeavour. Rs 110 lakh crore will be spent
on this project. For this, about seven thousand projects have been
identified in different sectors. This will also give a new direction and a fresh
momentum to the overall infrastructure development of the country. It is
often said that during crises, the emphasis should be given on
infrastructure so that economic activity is speeded up and people get
employment and it generates a cascading effect. Both small and large
enterprises, farmers and the middle class benefit to a great extent.

And I want to recall one incident today. When Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the
Prime Minister, he had started a programme with far-reaching impact called
the Golden Quadrilateral. He had taken the road network infrastructure to
the next generation level. Even today, the country looks at the ‘golden
quadrilateral’ with pride and feels yes, our country is transforming.

My dear countrymen,

Atal ji had done this work in his time but now we have to carry it forward.
We must give it a new thrust. We cannot work in silos. We do not need a
situation where in the infrastructure sector, road sector will work only for
roads and the rail sector will work only for rail. There is no coordination
between the railways and the roadways, between the airport and the port,
between the railway station and the bus station– this sort of situation is not
desirable. We must ensure that the infrastructure is a comprehensive and
an integrated one. It should be complementary to each other. The rail
should be complementary to the road, the road to sea port and the sea port
to the airport. We are moving towards a multi-modal connectivity
infrastructure for the new century. And this will give a new dimension. We
have started the work with a great dream. And I believe that by eliminating
silos, we will give a new strength to all these systems.

Along with this, our coastline has a very important significance in the world
trade. While moving on with Port led development, in the coming days, we
will focus on working towards building a modern state-of-art infrastructure
towards the construction of four lane road across the entire coastline.

My dear countrymen,

Our scriptures said something very profound. It is said in our scriptures
that- 'Samarthya mulam Swatantryam, Shram mulam Vaibhavam' means
'Capability is the source of freedom, and labour force is the source of
grandeur, prosperity and progress of any nation.

Therefore, nothing can match the hard work of the common man, be it
cities or villages. When a toiling society gets amenities, the struggles of life
ease, everyday troubles are reduced and this helps in boosting their energy
paying rich dividends.

In the last six years, several campaigns have been launched to improve the
lives of the toiling citizens of the country be it about their own bank
accounts, owning a pucca house, construction of such a large number of
toilets, providing electricity connection in every house, providing a gas
connection to free our mothers and sisters from the smoke, making efforts
to provide insurance protection to the poorest of the poor, Ayushman
Bharat Yojna to provide free treatment of upto five lakh rupees in the best
of hospitals, connecting Ration shops through digital technology. A
significant progress was made in the last six years to reinstate
transparency and remove discriminatory practices so that facilities reach
every poor person.

These instruments have also helped a lot in delivering the services
seamlessly during the Corona crisis. During this period, we continued to
provide free gas cylinders to crores of poor families, irrespective of whether
they had ration card or not the kitchen flames of more than 80 crores of my
countrymen were kept alighted by supplying free food grains to the 80
crores countrymen; approximately 90 thousand crore rupees were
transferred directly into the bank accounts. Just a few years ago, this would
have been unimaginable that all hundred paise of a rupee disbursed from
Delhi would reach the account of the poor. It was indeed beyond one's
imagination hitherto.

Garib Kalyan Rojgar Abhiyan has been launched to generate employment
in their own villages. We trust that our worker friends will be re-skilling and
upskilling themselves. Having full faith in their efforts, relying on the skilled
manpower, relying on rural and indigenous resources, we gave a clarion
call “vocal for local” and “re-skill and up-skill” in an endeavor to empower
our poor and our country's labour force.

Since the center of economic activity is the city, a scheme is being
implemented for workers like street vendors etc who come from off villages
to the cities for their livelihood, for providing finances directly by the banks.
Lakhs of people have taken advantage of this in such a short span of time
even during the period of the Corona crisis. Now they do not need to
borrow money at high interest. The workers can now get their money with
dignity and authority.

In the same way, when our workers migrate to the city, if they get good
accommodation then their efficiency also increases. And keeping this in
mind, we have formulated a major scheme for arranging affordable housing
for them inside the city, so that when the workers come to the city, they can
focus, deliver and progress with full faith and commitment.

My dear countrymen,

This is also true and we have seen that there are some segments of the
society which get left behind, are not able to come out of poverty in the
country’s march towards development, Similarly, there are some areas,
places, terrains which get left behind. Balanced development is very much
necessary to make India self-reliant. We have identified more than 110
aspiring districts which are lagging behind compared to an average district.
We have to bring each and every parameter of those districts at par with
the country’s average. We are making every effort so that people of these
110 districts, which are lagging behind, have access to better education,
better health facilities and have opportunities for local employment.

My dear countrymen,

The priority of a self-reliant India is a self-reliant farming sector and
self-reliant farmers. And we cannot ignore them. We have seen the
condition of farmers. Various reforms have been undertaken since
independence. We have to free them of all the shackles and we have done
that.

You can’t even imagine this. If you make soap, fabric or sugar in one corner
you can sell it in any part of the country. But not many people know that our
farmers could not sell their produce anywhere in the country and according
to their will. He had to sell his produce at a notified area. We have
eliminated all those restrictions.

Now India’s farmer will be able to breathe free by selling his produce in any
part of the country or the world according to his own terms. We have
emphasized on several alternative measures to increase the income of the
farmer. We are constantly working to reduce the input cost of the farming.
How can he be provided a solar pump instead of a diesel pump, how can
the producer of food become an energy producer? We are working in a
direction so that avenues like bee farming, fisheries, poultry, etc should be
made available to him so that his income gets doubled.

Time demands that our agriculture sector becomes modern and there
should be value addition, there should be food processing, food packaging.
And it needs better infrastructure.

You must have seen that the Indian government has sanctioned 1,00,000
crore rupees for agriculture infrastructure even during the Corona
pandemic. This infrastructure will be for the welfare of the farmers and they
will be able to get better prices of their produce, and will be able to sell their
produce in foreign markets. They will have greater reach to foreign
markets.

There is a need to strengthen rural industries. Special economic zones will
be created in the rural areas. A web of agriculture and non-agriculture
industries will be created. We have tried to create FPO (Farmer Product
Association) which will go a long way in their economic empowerment.

Brothers and sisters,

Last time, I had made an announcement for the Jal Jeevan Mission. It is
completing one year. I am very proud to tell you that our dream of making
available pure drinking water to all the people is getting realized. The
solution to several health problems is directly linked to the pure drinking
water. It also contributes to that nation’s economy. That’s why we have
started the Jal Jeevan Mission.

Today, I am happy to say that everyday we are able to supply piped-water
to over one lakh houses. And in the last one year, we have been able to
provide water to 2 crore families, especially to the tribals living in the forests
and far-flung areas. A huge campaign has been run. And I am glad that
today 'Jal-Jeevan Mission' has created an environment of healthy
competition in the country. There is a healthy competition among the
districts, among the cities and also among the states. Everyone is hoping
that the Prime Minister's dream of 'Jal-Jeevan Mission' is accomplished at
the earliest in their respective areas. The new strength of Cooperative and
Competitive Federalism has been associated with the ‘Jal Jeevan Mission’
and we are moving forward with it.

My dear countrymen,

Whether it is the agriculture sector, the small scale industries sector or the
people in services sector, almost all these people, in a way constitute a
huge middle class of India. The professionals from the middle class have
made a name for themselves in the world today. Our doctors, engineers,
lawyers, scientists, from the middle class have made a mark in the world.
Therefore, it is true that whatever opportunities that the middle class gets,
they make the most out of it and therefore the middle class needs freedom
from government interference. The middle class must get more new
opportunities and an open environment, and our government is constantly
working to fulfil these dreams of the middle class. The middle class has the
power to do miracles. So the middle class families get the greatest benefits
of Ease of living. Cheap internet, affordable smartphones or cheap flight
tickets under UDAN scheme or our highways or Information ways - all
these things are going to increase the strength of the middle class. Today
you must have seen that the prime dream of the middle class person who
has come out of poverty, is to have a home; he wants an equal life. We
have done a lot of work in the field of EMI in the country and as a result, the
Home Loan rates have become cheaper. When someone takes a home
loan, one can get a rebate of about 6 lakh rupees, by the time the loan is
repaid. Recently, it was noticed that a lot of affected middle-class families
have invested their money (to buy a house), but could not get the
possession of the house due to lack of completion of the schemes and
they were still living in a rented house. The Government of India has set up
a special fund of 25 thousand crores rupees to complete the incomplete
houses to ensure that middle class families get homes.

The rates of GST and the income tax have come down. Today, with these
minimum establishment facilities, we are trying to take the country forward.
Bringing co-operative banks under the ambit of RBI, in itself is a guarantee
for safety of the money of middle class families.

The reforms undertaken in the MSME sector and the agriculture sector, will
directly benefit these hard-working middle class families. Consequently, our
businessmen and small entrepreneurs will get the benefits of the special
fund of thousands of crores of rupees. The strength and energy of the
common Indian is the big foundation of the Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan.
Relentless work is going on at every level to maintain this strength.

My dear countrymen,
Education of the country is of great importance in building a self-reliant,
modern, New India, an India which will be prosperous and happy. With this
thought, we have become successful today in providing the country with a
new National Education Policy after three decades.

Every nook and corner of India is welcoming it with renewed enthusiasm
and a new vigour.. And this is the National Education Policy, which will
connect our students with the roots. Alongside, it will help them become
global citizens. The students will be well-rooted and still touching new
heights.

You must have noticed that a special stress has been laid in National
Education Policy on National Research Foundation because in order to
progress, the nation needs to innovate. Higher the stress that will be laid on
innovation and research, greater would be the strength to take India
forward in this competitive world.

Who would have thought that there would be online classes in rural areas
and such a momentum would be created so fast? Sometimes, in the times
of adversity, new revolutionary initiatives emerge with force. That’s the
reason we have witnessed how in this pandemic situation, a culture of
online classes has emerged.

You can see how fast the online digital transactions are increasing. Look at
BHIM UPI app…. Anyone would be immensely proud to know that we could
make transactions of Rs 3 Lakh Crore in the last month alone through
BHIM UPI.. This is an excellent example of how we have accepted the
changing scenarios.

If you see, prior to 2014, only 5 dozen panchayats had the optical fiber
network. However in the last 5 years, 1.5 lakh panchayats are connected
with the optical fiber network which is helping us today, immensely. We are
working on the goal of taking it to every panchayat and this work is in
progress in the remaining one lakh panchayats. In these changing times it
is essential that Rural India is also brought under the ambit of Digital India.
There is a surge in the demand of online facilities among the rural
population. Keeping this in view, we had earlier proposed the extension of
connectivity to every panchayat and today I would like to assure you that
we have decided that we will connect all our six lakh villages, with the
optical fiber network. As the requirements have changed, so have our
priorities. In over six lakh villages, thousands and lakhs of kilometers of
optical fiber would be laid down. We have decided that within 1000 days,
we will complete the work of connecting over six lakhs villages with optical
fiber.

In this era of technology, our dependence on cyberspace is going to
increase multifold. However, cyberspace offers its own risks and threats.
The world is very well aware of these. It can be a threat to the social fabric
of our country, our economy and can even threaten the development of our
nation; we are very well-aware of that. India is very cautious and is
planning to take steps to combat these risks. Not only this, new systems
are continuously being developed. In a short span of time, a draft of new
cyber security policy would be presented to the nation. In the coming times,
we will have to integrate everything and then work within the framework of
this cyber security. We will formulate strategies to move forth.

My dear countrymen,

Whenever opportunities were given to women power in India, they have
brought glory to the country and have strengthened the country. Today the
country is committed to providing equal opportunities for employment and
self-employment to women. Today women in India are working in
underground coal mines. Today, the daughters of my country are also flying
the fighter planes and touching the skies. Today India is among those
countries of the world where women are being included in the combat role
in the Navy and the Air Force. We have taken the decision of providing 6
months paid leave to pregnant women, liberating our Muslim sisters and
women of our country from the suffering of triple talaq and the economic
empowerment of women.
Out of the 40 crore Jan Dhan accounts, 22 crore accounts belong to our
sisters. During the Corona period, about 30 thousand crore rupees have
been deposited into the accounts of these sisters. Around 25 crore MUDRA
loans have been given, in which 70% of the loans have been given to our
mothers and sisters. Under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, maximum
registration is also being done in the names of women.

My dear countrymen,

This government has also been persistently concerned about the better
healthcare for poor sisters and daughters. We have done a huge job to
providing sanitary pads at one rupee each in Janaushadhi Kendra. In a
short span of time, more than 5 crore sanitary pads have been delivered to
these poor women from 6000 Janaushadhi Kendras.

We have formed a committee to ensure that the daughters are no longer
suffering from malnutrition and they are married off at the right age. As
soon as the report is submitted, appropriate decisions will be taken about
the age of marriage of daughters.

My dear countrymen,

It is very natural that health sector draws attention in this period of Corona
pandemic. As such, the biggest lesson of self-reliance has been taught to
us by the Health Sector during this crisis. And to achieve that goal we also
have to move forward.

You see, earlier there was only one Lab for testing in our country. Today
there is a network of 1400 Labs, spread in every corner of the country. In
the initial stage of the Corona crisis, only 300 tests could be conducted in
one day, but in such a short span of time, our people have shown that
today we can conduct more than 7 lakh tests per day. We started with 300
and reached 7 lakhs!
We are making continuous efforts towards modernization, construction of
new AIIMS and new Medical Colleges in the country. In five years, the
MBBS and MD seats have been increased for more than 45 thousand
students. There are more than 1.5 lakh wellness centers in the villages and
about one-third of them are already functional, which have helped a lot
during this Corona pandemic. The Wellness Centers in the Corona times
have helped the villages immensely.

A massive campaign is going to start in the health sector from today and
technology will also play a major role in it.

The National Digital Health Mission is also being launched from today. It will
bring a new revolution in India's Health Sector. Technology will be used
prudently to reduce the challenges in treatment.

Every Indian will be given a Health ID. This Health ID will work like a Health
Account of every Indian. This account will contain your details of every
test, every disease, the doctors you visited, the medicines you took and the
diagnosis. When and what was the report, all such information will be
incorporated in the Health ID.

The National Digital Health Mission will eliminate all these difficulties
related to appointment with a doctor, depositing money, making a slip in the
hospital, etc. We are devising a system which will help each and every
citizen to make a better and informed decision.

My dear countrymen, there is a curiosity among everybody when the
Corona vaccine will be ready. This is natural. This anxiety is there in
everybody and everywhere in the world.

I would like to tell my countrymen that our scientists are dutifully engaged
in the laboratories. They are putting in great efforts. At present, testing for
three vaccines is in different stages in the country. Once we get a green
signal from our scientists, we will launch massive production of the vaccine.
We have made all the preparations. We have drawn an outline to ramp up
the production of the vaccines and to make it available to each and every
person in the shortest possible time.

My dear countrymen, there are different scenes of development in different
regions in our country. There are some regions which are well developed,
whereas there are others which are left behind. I think this imbalance is an
important challenge to make India self-reliant. As I said earlier, we are
emphasizing on 110 ambitious districts. We want these districts to be at par
with the developed ones. Our priority is to create an ecosystem for
development and improve connectivity.

Now you see. The western, central and eastern parts of the country -- be it
eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Northeast, or Odisha -- have abundant
reserves of natural wealth. The people of these regions are very capable,
strong and talented, but there has been an imbalance in these regions due
to the absence of opportunities. Therefore, we have taken several
measures. We are developing Eastern Dedicated Freight Corridor,
connecting the eastern region with the gas pipe line, developing new rail
infrastructure and new ports. We are developing the entire infrastructure for
the development in a very holistic way.

Similarly, Leh-Ladakh, Jammu-Kashmir have been freed from Article 370. It
has been one year now. This one year is a major milestone in the new
development journey of Jammu-Kashmir. This has been a year of providing
basic rights to the women and to the Dalits. It has also been a year for our
refugees to live a life of dignity. We have launched several campaigns like
Back to Villages so that the villages get benefited. Today, the Ayushman
Scheme is being used in the best possible way in the region of
Jammu-Kashmir and Ladakh.

My dear countrymen, the true strength of our democracy lies in the elected
local bodies. It is a matter of pride for us that the peoples’ representatives
of the local units in Jammu and Kashmir are actively pursuing a new era of
development with activism and sensitivity. I congratulate their “panch,
sarpanch”(village headmen) for their active participation in this
development journey.

The delimitation exercise is going on in Jammu-Kashmir under the
leadership of a retired chief justice of the Supreme Court. We want early
completion of the delimitation exercise so that there are early elections,
there should be Jammu-Kashmir MLAs, its own cabinet, its Chief Minister
so that it can march towards development with a new vigour. India is
committed to it and is making all efforts in this regard.

We have taken a bold step to meet the aspirations of the people of Ladakh
by making it the Union Territory which has been their demand for the last
several years. Nestled in the heights of the Himalayas, Ladakh is
progressing towards new heights. Work is going on for a central university,
setting up new research centres, new courses for hotel and management.
Plan is also under way for the creation of 7,500 MW Solar Park. But, my
dear countrymen, Ladakh has several specialties. Not only do we have to
preserve them, we have to nurture them as well. As Sikkim has made its
mark as an Organic State in the northeast, Ladakh, Leh and Kargil can also
create their own niche as a Carbon Neutral unit. Indian government has
joined hands with the locals of the region to create a new model of
development as per their own requirements.

My dear countrymen, India has shown that the march towards development
is possible by balancing the environment. Today India is inspiring the entire
world with its vision of one world, one sun and one grid, particularly in the
field of solar energy.

India has established itself as one of the five countries in the world in the
generation of renewable energy. India is both aware as well as involved in
finding solutions to pollution. We are leaving no stone unturned whether it is
the Swachh India campaign, smoke-less cooking gas, LED campaign,
CNG-based transportation, or electric mobility. We are emphasizing on
increasing the use of ethanol to reduce pollution caused due to petrol.
What was the condition of ethanol in our country five years ago? Five years
ago, there used to be only 40 crore litre production of ethanol. It has risen
to five times in the last five years. Today, we are producing 200 crore litres
of ethanol which is proving to be very helpful towards our environment.

My dear countrymen, we are working on a holistic approach to reduce
pollution in the select 100 cities through an integrated approach and
modern technology with people’s participation.

My dear countrymen,

India can say this proudly that it is one of the very few countries where its
area under forests is expanding. India is committed towards the promotion
and conservation of its Biodiversity. We have successfully carried forward
Project Tiger and Project Elephant. The Tiger population has increased in
India. In the coming days, we are starting ‘Project Lion’ for the Asiatic
Lions. And under Project Lion the work on the required infrastructure for the
protection and security of Indian lions and in particular, the special type of
health infrastructure required will be undertaken. And emphasis will be laid
on Project Lion.

Also, one more work we want to promote and that is - Project Dolphin. We
will focus on both types of dolphins living in the rivers and in the seas. This
will also give a boost to Biodiversity and also create employment
opportunities. This is also a center of attraction for tourism. So, we are
going to move forward in this direction too.

My dear countrymen,

When we embark on an extraordinary journey with an extraordinary goal,
the path will also be full of challenges and these challenges too are
extraordinary. Notwithstanding the recent adversities, there have been
misadventures along the border which threw a challenge to the country.
But whoever tried to threaten the sovereignty of our country right from the
LOC to the LAC, the army of the country, our brave soldiers have given a
befitting reply.
The whole country is full of zeal, driven by conviction and moving forward
with unwavering devotion to protect India's sovereignty. The world has seen
what our brave Jawans can do in Ladakh,, what the country can do to
defend its resolve. Today, I pay obeisance to all the brave men and
soldiers who sacrificed their lives for the motherland from the ramparts of
the Red Fort.

Be it terrorism or expansionism, India is fighting against it valiantly. Today,
the world's faith in India has become stronger. Recently, as a
non-Permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, 184
countries out of 192 supported India. This is a matter of great pride for
every Indian. This is an example of how we have made our place in the
world. And this is possible only when India itself is strong, India is powerful
and safe. With this thinking, work is being carried out on many fronts today.

My dear countrymen,

We are establishing deep relations based on security, development and
trust with our neighbouring countries whether connected by sea or land.
India has been making continuous efforts to deepen its decades-old
cultural, economic and social ties with its neighbouring countries.

The world’s one-fourth population lives in South Asia. We can create
countless opportunities for the welfare of such a large population through
cooperation and partnership. There is a huge and significant responsibility
on the part of all the leaders of the countries in this region for the progress
and development of such a vast population. I call upon all the people,
political leaders, parliamentarians and intellectuals of South Asia to fulfil
their responsibility. The peace and harmony in this entire region will be of
immense help to the welfare of humanity. The interests of the entire world
are intertwined with it.

Today, neighbours are not the only ones with whom we share geographical
boundaries, but also those with whom we have close and harmonious
relations. It is my pleasure that India has strengthened its relationship with
all the countries in its extended neighbourhood in the last few years. The
political, economic and human relations with the countries in West Asia
have progressed manifold. Trust has increased manifold. The economic
ties, particularly in the field of energy sector, are very important with these
countries. There are a large number of people from India who are working
in many of these countries. India is indebted to all these countries for their
help to the Indian community during the Corona crisis by honouring India’s
request. I want to personally thank them.

Similarly, our ASEAN countries in the east, who are our maritime
neighbours, also hold special importance. India has thousands of years old
religious and cultural ties with these countries. The traditions of Buddhism
connect us with them. Today, India is strengthening its cooperation not only
in the field of security but also in the areas of marine wealth with these
countries.

My dear citizens, India has as much commitment to make its security
apparatus & armies strong as it has for establishing peace & harmony.
Mammoth steps have been taken in the field of defence production, to
make self-reliant India. Recently, we have put a stop on the import of more
than 100 military equipment. From missiles to light military helicopters, from
assault rifles to transport aircraft - all will be made in India. Our Tejas is
getting ready to equip itself as per the modern requirements, for putting up
a show of its majesty, speed and strength. Our borders and coastal
infrastructure play a pivotal role in national security. Today emphasis is
being laid on connectivity in every direction, be it at Himalayan peaks, or
the islands of Indian Ocean. New roads are being constructed everywhere,
from Ladakh to Arunachal Pradesh, keeping in mind national security.

Dear citizens, we have such a vast coastline. Alongside, we have over
1300 islands. Keeping the importance of a few identified islands in mind,
we are developing them very fast. You must have seen, last week, five
days back, a submarine optical fiber cable project in Andaman and Nicobar
Islands was dedicated to the nation. Andaman and Nicobar islands will now
have the internet facility just like Delhi and Chennai. Soon we will move
forth in connecting Lakshadweep islands in the similar manner.

We are aiming at providing high speed internet connectivity to
Lakshadweep islands in the next 1000 days. Alongwith the security and
development, the youth residing in the coastal area and near borders mind,
we are working on developmental projects and taking steps, starting a big
campaign.

About 173 districts in our border areas, our coastal areas share their
boundaries with some or the other nation’s border or coastline. In the
coming days, NCC would be extended in those border districts for the
youth there. We will train around one lakh new NCC cadets from bordering
areas, and we will work towards the idea that amongst those, one-third of
them are our daughters. The Army will train these border area cadets. The
cadets for coastal areas would be trained by the navy and wherever there
is an air base, the air force will train those cadets. The border and coastal
areas would get trained manpower for disaster management, and the youth
would also get skill training for making their career in the armed forces.

Dear citizens, last year in my address from the Red Fort, I had said that the
previous five years were for meeting the prerequisites, and next five years
would be for fulfillment of aspirations. In last year itself, the nation has
achieved many big and important milestones. On the 150th year of
Gandhi’s birth anniversary, India freed its villages from open defecation. Be
it the Citizenship Amendment Act for the refugees suffering due to their
beliefs, reservation rights for Dalits/Backwards/SCs/STs/OBCs, historic
peace agreement in Assam and Tripura, appointment of Chief of Defence
staff for making the collective power of armies more effective, or the
construction of Kartarpur Sahib Corridor in a record period, India has
created history, it saw history being created, extraordinary feats were
achieved.

Ten days ago, the construction of Lord Rama’s magnificent temple in
Ayodhya began. A peaceful culmination has been achieved to the age-old
issue of Ram Janmbhoomi. The citizens of India have shown an exemplary
restraint and wisdom, and acted responsibly. It is simply unprecedented
and a motivating factor for the future. Peace, unity and harmony- these are
going to be the strengths of self-reliant India. This harmony, goodwill- this is
the guarantee of prosperous future of India. We need to advance with this
harmony. Each Indian must sacrifice something or the other in the
magnanimous yajna for development.

India will move forward with new policy, new customs in this decade. Now
banal won’t work. The time has gone when casual attitude used to suffice.
We are no less than anyone in the world. We will thrive to be the best. For
this, we need to work towards being best in manufacturing, best in human
resources, finest in governance, and aim to make a headway while
achieving the best in every field by the 75th anniversary of our
Independence.

Our policies, processes, products- everything must be par excellence, the
best, and then only the idea of ‘Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat’ can be
achieved. Today, again we need to take a resolve that we will fulfill the
dreams of those who sacrificed their lives for our freedom. This pledge
must be for 1.3 billion citizens, for our future generations, for their bright
future, for the self-reliant India. We must take a pledge, we must take an
oath, that we will contribute towards reducing the import dependence, we
will empower our small-scale industries, we all will be vocal for local. we will
innovate more, empower our youth, women, scheduled tribes, scheduled
castes, specially differently-abled, economically weaker sections, villages,
backward classes, and everyone.

Today India has made impossible possible at an extraordinary pace. With
the same willpower, similar dedication, same passion, each Indian must
move forward.

Soon we will be celebrating the festival of the 75th year of our
Independence in the year 2022. We are just one step away. We must burn
the midnight oil. This third decade of the 21st century should be the decade
when we fulfill our dreams. Corona is a big hurdle, but not that huge that it
can stop us from moving ahead on the victorious path of self-reliant India.

I can see the dawn of a new era for India, rise of new self-confidence, a
bugle of echo of self-reliant India. Once again, I extend my heartiest best
wishes of Independence Day to all. Let’s all come together, and raise our
hands, and say with all the power at our command: -

Bharat mata ki Jai, Bharat mata ki Jai, Bharat mata ki Jai

Vande Mataram, Vande Mataram, Vande Mataram

Jai Hind, Jai Hind!"
2019,Narendra Modi,BJP,NA,"English rendering of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s address to the Nation from the ramparts of the Red Fort on the 73rd Independence Day- August, 15, 2019",Press Information Bureau,https://pib.gov.in/,"My dear countrymen,

On this solemn day of Independence, many greetings to all countrymen.

Today is also the festival of Raksha Bandhan. This centuries-old tradition
expresses the love of brother and sister. I extend my best wishes to all the
countrymen and all the brothers and sisters on this auspicious festival of
Raksha Bandhan. May this festival filled with affection fulfil the hopes,
aspirations and dreams of all our brothers and sisters, and bring affection in
their lives.

Today, while the country is celebrating the festival of independence, people
in several parts of the country are facing difficulties due to floods and heavy
rainfall. Many have lost their dear ones. I express my condolences to them.
The State Governments, the Central Government and other organizations
like NDRF are striving day and night to ease the hardships and bring the
situation under control.

Today, when we are celebrating this auspicious day of Independence, I pay
my respects to all those who gave up their lives, who spent their youth in
prisons, who embraced the gallows, who instilled the spirit of non-violence
through Satyagraha for the freedom of the country. The country gained
independence under the leadership of Bapu. Similarly, in the years since
independence numerous people have contributed for the peace, prosperity
and security of the country. Today, I also salute the people who have
contributed to fulfil the hopes and aspirations of the people, for the
development, peace and prosperity of Independent India.

After the formation of the new government, I am humbled once again with
the opportunity to interact with you. It has not even been 10 weeks since
the formation of this new Government. But even in a short ten-week period,
efforts have been made in all fields and in every direction, new dimensions
have been added. People have entrusted us to serve them so that they can
achieve their hopes, expectations and aspirations. We are dedicated to
your service with complete devotion, without wasting even a single
moment.

To revoke Article 370 and 35A within 10 weeks is a significant step towards
fulfilling the dream of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel.

In just ten weeks, we made big ticket decisions like bringing about a law
against Triple Talaq to protect the rights of our Muslim women, making
major amendments in laws to counter terrorism and to make it more
stringent and powerful; transfer of approximately 90,000 crores of rupees to
the bank accounts of farmers who are beneficiaries of PM Kisan Samman
Nidhi Yojana.

Our brothers and sisters from the farming community, our small
entrepreneurs could never believe that they will ever be able to avail of
pension schemes and live a dignified life even after they attain 60 Years,
when they are physically weak and need some support. We have
implemented a Pension Scheme to meet these needs.

Water crisis is a big concern these days. It is being predicted that an
impending water crisis is staring us in the face. Anticipating such a
situation, we have announced the formation of a new dedicated Ministry of
Jal Shakti where the Centre and States will together develop schemes and
policies to address issues of water crisis.

Our country needs doctors in huge numbers along with robust health
facilities. To fulfil this requirement we need new laws, upgraded
infrastructure, new thinking and create new opportunities to motivate the
youth to take up the medical profession. In view of this, we have formulated
laws and taken important steps to bring transparency in Medical Education.

Now a days we come across incidents of child rights violation all over the
world and India will not leave her children vulnerable. A much warranted
stringent law to protect child rights was needed and has been enacted.
Brothers and sisters, you gave me an opportunity to serve you all for five
years from 2014-2019. We took cognizance of the struggles faced by the
common man to avail the basic facilities. Over the past five years, our
government has been striving to provide the facilities to meet the daily
needs of the common man. Special efforts have been made to facilitate
those living in villages, and those who are poor, marginalized, victimized,
exploited, deprived and tribals. We are working relentlessly in this direction
to bring the nation back on track towards development. But times change.
While 2014-2019 was a period of fulfilling your basic needs, the years from
2019 and beyond will see your aspirations and dreams getting fulfilled.

What should 21st Century India look like? How fast should it move? How
extensively, should it work, what heights should it strive for- we are taking
steps one after the other by preparing a roadmap for the next five years,
keeping all these things in mind.In 2014, It was a new beginning for me.
Prior to the election in 2013-2014, I travelled across the country and tried to
understand the feelings of our countrymen. But everyone had
disappointment written on their face, everyone had apprehensions. People
used to wonder if the country could change at all. Can the country change
with the change of Government? A sense of hopelessness had percolated
into the minds of the common man. This was the result of their experience
over a long period- hopes did not last long, they sank into the depths of
despair very fast. But when in 2019, after five years of hard work, with only
dedication to the common people, only my country in my heart, only my
millions of countrymen in my heart - with this feeling we kept on moving,
dedicated every moment for that. When we ran for the office again in 2019,
I was surprised. The Mood of the country changed. Despair had changed
into hope, dreams got linked to resolutions, accomplishment was visible
and the common man had only one determination that he can change his
country. Yes it was the feeling that We too can change our country and that
we cannot stay behind.

This feeling of the 130 crore citizens, this echoing of emotions gives us new
the strength, new faith.
We had started with the mantra Sabka Saath- Sabka Vikas , but within five
years, the countrymen have painted the entire mood of the nation with the
color of Sabka Vishwas. The Trust and confidence that everyone reposed
in us over the last five years will inspire us to serve the nation with more
vigour.

I have seen in the recent elections and I had felt then that this is an election
in which no politician was contesting, no political party was contesting,
neither Modi was contesting nor were friends of Modi contesting the
election. It was the people of India who were contesting the election, 130
Crore countrymen were contesting the election. They were contesting for
their own dreams. The real nature of Democracy could be seen in this
election.

My dear countrymen, the solution to the problems - along with the period of
dreams, determination and accomplishment - we have to walk together
now. It is evident that sense of self-reliance develops when problems get
solved. Solution to problems encourages speed of self-reliance. When
self-reliance occurs, self-esteem develops automatically and self-esteem
has very strong potential. The power of self-respect is greater than
anything and when there is a solution, resolution, capability, self-respect,
then nothing can come in the way of success.

And today, with that self-respect we are determined to move forward to
touch new heights of success. When we are trying to solve problems we
should not think in isolation. There will be difficulties. Half-hearted efforts
made with the aim of earning applause will not help in fulfilling the dreams
of the country. We have to strive to remove problems from their roots.

You would have seen how our Muslim daughters and sisters used to live in
fear with the sword of Triple Talaq dangling over their heads. Even if they
were not victims of Triple Talaq, they were constantly haunted by the fear
that they could be subjected to it anytime. Many Islamic countries abolished
this evil practice long time back. But for some reason we were hesitant to
give our Muslim mothers and sisters their due rights. If, we can abolish Sati
Pratha, if we can enact laws to end female foeticide, if we can raise our
voice against child marriage, if we can take strong steps against dowry
system in this country, then why can’t we raise our voice against Triple
Talaq? We have taken this important decision in the spirit of India’s
democracy and constitution, to respect the thinking of Baba Saheb
Ambedkar so that our Muslim sisters get equal rights; so that new
confidence is generated in them; so that they also become active
participants in the India’s development journey. Such decisions are not for
political gains. They guarantee a lasting protection to our mothers and
sisters.

Similarly, I will give another example. What was the reason behind
revocation of Article 370 and 35A? This is the hallmark of this government.
We do not avoid problems, nor do we let them fester. There is no time to
delay or neglect problems. The work that was not done in the last 70 years
has been accomplished within 70 days after this new government came to
power. The abrogation of Article 370 and 35A has been carried out in both
Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha by two-thirds majority. This means that
everyone wanted this decision, but perhaps they were waiting for
somebody to initiate the same and carry it forward. I have come to
accomplish the task assigned to me by my countrymen. I work selflessly.

We are moving forward with re-organization of Jammu and Kashmir. For 70
years every government made efforts to do something.

But the desired results were not achieved, and when desired results are not
achieved, there is a need to think afresh and take new steps. It is our
responsibility to see that the aspirations of the people of Jammu, Kashmir
and Ladakh get fulfilled. It is our collective responsibility to give new wings
to their dreams. This responsibility has to be shouldered by all 130 crore of
my countrymen. To meet this commitment we have made endeavours to
remove whatever hurdles were there in the way.

The system that prevailed over the past seventy years had aggravated
separatism and given birth to terrorism. It had encouraged dynastic rule
and in a way strengthened the foundations of corruption and discrimination.
We have to make efforts so that the women of Jammu & Kashmir and
Ladakh get their rights. We have to make efforts so that my dalit brothers
and sisters living there, get the rights which they have been deprived of so
far. The rights enjoyed by the tribal people of India must also be available
to my tribal brothers and sisters of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh. There
are several such communities, like Gujjars, Bakarwals, Gaddis, Sippies or
Balties- all such communities must be empowered with political rights. It is
surprising that in Jammu & Kashmir there were legal restrictions on Safai
Karamchari brothers and sisters. Their dreams were trampled upon. Now,
we have freed them from such shackles.

When India was partitioned, crores of people had to leave behind their
ancestral homes for no fault of theirs. Those who settled down in Jammu &
Kashmir got neither human rights, nor citizenship rights. There are people
from hill regions living in Jammu &Kashmir. We intend to take steps for their
welfare as well.

My dear countrymen, peace and prosperity of Jammu & Kashmir and
Ladakh can be an inspiration for India. They can greatly contribute to
India’s development. We need to make efforts to bring back their glorious
past. The new system that has come into being after the recent step will
create facilities that will directly benefit the people of the State. Now,
anybody in Jammu and Kashmir, like the rest of Indians, can reach out to
the Government in Delhi. There will be no hurdles in between. We have
put in place such a system. Our recent action to strike down Article 370
and 35 A has been welcomed by the entire country and also by people
from all political parties of the country, without exception. Some have
openly supported us while others give their tacit support. But some in the
corridors of power, in a bid to take mileage from vote-bank politics, have
been talking in favour of Article 370. The country demands an answer from
those speaking in favour of Article 370, that if Article 370 and 35-A were so
important.
If Article 370 was so crucial then why did ruling parties not make it
permanent in the last 70 years despite having a majority? Why was it kept
temporary? If there was so much of conviction, you should have moved
ahead and made it permanent. This means that you knew all along that the
decision taken was not right. But you did not have the courage and the will
to amend it. Concerns about political future kept coming up. For me, the
country’s future is everything, political future has no meaning.

Our constitution makers and great personalities like Sardar Vallabh Bhai
Patel took these bold and important decisions even during those difficult
times, keeping the goals of national integration and political unification in
mind. The exercise towards national integration was a successful one, but
some difficulties have been faced because of Article 370 and 35A.

Today, as I address the nation from the Red Fort, I can proudly say that
every Indian today can speak of One Nation, One Constitution and we are
trying to fulfil Sardar Sahibs dream of Ék Bharat Shreshtha Bharat. So we
must develop such systems which strengthen the country’s unity and serve
as a cementing force, and this process must go on continuously. It should
not be merely an interim measure but a continuous process.

Through GST we have fulfilled the dream of One Nation One Tax. Similarly,
we successfully achieved the dream of One Nation, One Grid in the energy
sector recently.

Likewise, we have developed the system of One Nation, One Mobility card
and currently there is a nationwide debate about holding simultaneous
elections in the country. This discussion should be taken up in a
democratic manner. We will have to add many such new ideas to realize
our dreams of Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat.

My dear countrymen, the country has to achieve newer heights, the country
has to make its mark globally. For this we have to change the attitude
towards poverty alleviation in the country. It should not be treated as a
favour, but as oura dutiful contribution towards building a bright future for
the country because we have to free ourselves from the clutches of poverty
at any cost. A number of successful efforts have been made during the last
5 years to reduce poverty. We have achieved more success than before
and at a faster pace. A little respect and support to the poor can boost their
self-esteem and pull them out from the grips of poverty without any
government help.

He will be able to defeat poverty with his own strength. It is my poor
brethren who have the might to fight against any adversity. He fights
against extreme cold with his clenched fists. We need to bow before his
innate strength to face adversities and help in eliminating the challenges of
his daily life.

Why should poor people not have toilets, no electricity in the house, no
house to live in, no water supply and no bank account. Why should they be
compelled to go to the moneylender to take loans through mortgage?
Come, let us make efforts to boost the self-respect, self-confidence and
self-esteem of the poor.

Brothers and sisters, it is over 70 years since Independence. All
governments have done a lot of work in their own way. Every government,
irrespective of the party, be it the central or the state, has tried in its own
way. But still it is a fact that today almost half of the houses in India do not
have drinking water. People have to struggle to get drinking water. Mothers
and sisters have to travel 2, 3, 5 km carrying the load of water on their
heads. A large part of their lives is spent in struggling for water. Therefore,
this government has decided to emphasize upon a special task and that is -
how to ensure availability of water in every house. How does every house
get water, pure drinking water? And so I declare from the Red Fort today
that in the days to come, we will take forward the 'Jal-Jeevan' Mission. The
central and the state governments will jointly work on this 'Jal-Jeevan'
Mission. We have promised to spend more than Rs. 3.5 lakh crores on this
mission in the coming years. Work should be done on water conservation,
irrigation, rain-water harvesting, seawater or waste water treatment, and
'Per Drop, More Crop Micro Irrigation for the farmers. Water conservation
campaigns should be launched, creating awareness in the common
citizens about water, arousing their sensitivity so that they understand the
importance of water; even the children should be taught about water
conservation as part of their curriculum in their childhood. We must move
forward with the belief that in the next five years we have to do more than
four times the work that has been done in the last 70 years for water
conservation and to revive the sources of water. We cannot wait any longer.
The great Saint Thiruvalluvar ji had professed hundreds of years ago when
perhaps no one would have thought of the water crisis and the importance
of water.

And then Saint Thiruvalluvar ji had said NeerIndri Amiyadhu Ulganein
नीरिंडरी अमियद ु उलगनें meaning that if water starts disappearing, then
nature’s processes get disrupted and eventually come to an end. This
initiates the process of total destruction.

I was born in Gujarat. In North Gujarat, there is a jain pilgrim city called
Mahudi. Approximately 100 years ago there lived a Jain saint who was
born in a farmer’s family. He used to work in the fields but under the
influence of Jainism. He became a Jain saint called Budhi Sagar ji Maharaj.
He left behind some scriptures 100 years ago in which he shared a
premonition that there will be a time when water will be sold in grocery
shops. Can you imagine that the words of the saint written hundred years
ago have actually become a reality now. What was predicted a century ago
is now a ground reality, and today, we all are actually buying water from
grocery shops.

Dear countrymen, we are not to get tired in our efforts, nor shall we halt or
hesitate in moving ahead.

This campaign on Water conservation should not just remain a government
initiative. It should become a people’s movement like our Swacchh Bharat
Abhiyan. We have to carry forward this movement with the help the
common man’s ideals, aspirations and efforts.
Dear Countrymen, our nation has reached a phase when we should be
transparent about everything.

Time has now come that we should take challenges head-on. Sometimes
decisions are taken keeping in mind political advantage but they come at
the cost of growth of future generation of our country. I would like to
highlight the issue of population explosion in one Country from the aegis of
the Red Fort today.

This rapidly increasing population poses various new challenges for us and
our future generations.

In our society, there is a section which is very well aware of the
consequences of the uncontrolled population growth. They all deserve
accolades and respect. This is also their expression for their love for the
nation. Before having a baby, they take a well considered decision whether
they will be able to take care of the child’s needs and fulfill his/her dreams
by playing the role of a responsible parent.

Keeping these parameters in mind, this small sections of responsible
citizens is self motivated to keep their family small. Not only do they
contribute to the welfare of their family but also to the good of the nation.

They express patriotism. I would like all the people of our society to watch
their lives closely and see how much they have served their families by
limiting increase in family size. It is about how the family has moved
forward in just a generation or two, how the children have got education,
how the family is free from disease, how well the family fulfils their primary
needs.

We should learn from them. Before a child arrives into our family we should
think - have I prepared myself to fulfil the needs of the child ? Or will I
leave it dependent on the society? Will I leave the child un-nurtured? No
parents can continue to give birth to children who are forced to live this type
of life and therefore a social awareness is needed.
The people who have played this huge role need to be honoured, and by
setting them as examples we need to inspire the segment of the society
who are still not thinking on these lines. We need to worry about population
explosion.

Governments also have to come forward through different schemes. Be it
the State Government or the Central Government - everyone has to walk
together to shoulder this responsibility. We cannot think of an unhealthy
society, we cannot think of an uneducated society. In 21st century India, the
ability to fulfill dreams starts with a person, starts with a family. If the
population is not educated, not healthy, then neither the home nor the
country can be happy. If the population is educated, empowered, and
skilled and has adequate means available to achieve the right ambience to
fulfill their wishes and needs, then I think the country can fulfill these things.

My dear countrymen, you are well aware that corruption and nepotism have
damaged our country beyond imagination and entered into our lives like
termites. We are continuously trying to weed them out. There have been
successes also, but the disease is so deeply entrenched, the disease is so
wide spread that we will have to keep putting in more efforts and that too at
every level, not just at the government level, and we need to keep doing it
continuously.

All work cannot be done at one go, bad habits are like chronic disease.
Sometimes it gets cured, but sometimes it relapses. This too is a disease
for which we have taken many steps, eliminating it by continuous use of
technology. Every effort has been made to strengthen honesty and
transparency at all levels.

You must have seen that immediately after formation of the Government,
and also in the last five years the Government has removed many top
officials. All such people creating obstacles were told that the country does
not need their services anymore and they have been removed.
I believe that there should be change in the system, but at the same time
there should be a change in the social fabric. Along with the change in the
social fabric, a change in the mindset and beliefs of the people running the
systems is also very essential. Then only the desired results can be
achieved.

Brothers and sisters, the country has, in a way, matured after so many
years of independence.

We are going to celebrate the 75th anniversary of Independence. This
Freedom is as precious to us as our ethical values, attitudes and
sensitivities. Whenever I hold meetings with officials I’d always mention, I
do not talk about it publicly but today I feel like speaking out, I repeatedly
exhort the officials that after so many years of Independence can we not do
something about cutting down red tape and reduce the involvement of the
Government in the daily life of the common man.

The meaning of an Independent India for me is to create an ecosystem that
gradually reduces the involvement of govt. in the lives of its peoples. This
will give people the choice to decide about their own destiny and embark
upon whichever direction they wish in the national interest, for betterment
of their families and in the pursuit of their dreams.

Citizens should not feel pressure of the government but at the same time
during a crisis the government must not be found wanting. The government
should neither be exerting nor wanting, but let us all move forward with our
dreams. The government should be always standing by us, as a
companion. In case the need arises, the people should be assured that
Govt. is always there to back them up. Can we create such a system?

We have done away with several unnecessary laws and rules which had
been rendered redundant. In the last five years I have abolished,
practically, one redundant law every day. Perhaps the common man is not
aware of it, - abolishing one obsolete law each day means almost 1,450
laws have been done away with an aim to reduce the burden from the
common man’s life. The (new) government has only completed ten weeks
into office, and already (another) 60 laws have been repealed with an aim
to bring about ‘Ease of Living’. ‘Ease of Living’ is imperative for an
Independent India and we are committed to focus on ‘Ease of Living’ and
want to take it ahead.

Today, we have made much progress towards ‘Ease of doing business.’ We
aim to reach the Top Five in the global ranking and for this there will be a
need for several reforms; anybody wanting to set up a small business or
industry, faces several small and big issues, - such as filling up several
forms, going from pillar to post, he has to make visits to scores of offices,
but he still doesn’t get the requisite sanction. In attempts to unshackle this
intricate web, bringing reforms after reform, taking the Centre and States
together, taking along the city and metropolitan municipalities, we have
been able to achieve a fair degree of success towards ‘Ease of doing
business.’

Across the globe there is a growing realization that such a large country as
India, a developing nation, can dream big and make such a big leap. ‘Ease
of doing business’ seems just a milestone; my ultimate objective is to
achieve is ‘Ease of living’, - where a common man does not have to
exercise himself to get Govt./Officials clearances, he gets his due rights
easily and thus there is a need for us to proceed in that direction.

My dear countrymen, our nation must march forward, but the country
cannot now wait much longer for incremental progress, we will have to take
a big leap, we will have to change our thinking. To make India reach the
Global Standards we need to build modern infrastructure.

Notwithstanding despondent attitudes, ordinary people always dream of a
good system. They like good things; they have developed a taste for it. So
we have decided to invest 100 lakh crore rupees for modern infrastructure
in this time period. This will generate employment; will develop new
systems and various aspirations will be met. Be it Sagarmala Project or
Bharat Mala Project, modern railway stations, bus stations or airports, be it
modern hospitals or world class educational institutions, we want to
develop the entire infrastructure. Now the country also requires seaports.
The ordinary people have changed and we have to understand that.

Earlier, if a decision was taken on paper that a railway station was going to
be constructed in a particular area, there used to be a positive feeling for
years together that a new railway station would be available somewhere
nearby. Times have changed now. The ordinary citizens are no longer
satisfied with just a railway station. They will immediately ask, “When will
Vande Bharat Express come to our area?” Their thinking has changed. If
we construct a very good bus station or five star Railway station, the people
will not say “well done”. They will forthwith ask, “When will the airport be
ready”? That means their thinking has changed. The people who were
happy with just getting a railway stoppage are now asking, “It is ok, but
when is the airport going to open here?”

Earlier people used to ask, “When will a metaled road be constructed in our
area?” Now people ask, “Will the road be of 4-lane or 6-lane one?” They
are not satisfied to metaled roads any longer. I think this is a very
significant change for aspiring India.

Earlier, even on seeing the electricity poles lying on the ground people
used to be happy, thinking that the electricity had reached them even if the
pole had not been erected. But now even after the installation of
transmission wires and electric meters, people ask “When will we get
24-hour electric supply?” They are no longer happy with just poles and
wires.

Earlier, when mobile phones were just in vogue, people were content that
mobile phone had finally arrived. But now they discuss about data speed.
We have to understand this transformation of psychology and changing
times. We have to move forward in many fields, with the Global Benchmark
like modern infrastructure, clean energy, gas based economy, gas grid,
e-mobility etc.
My dear Countrymen, generally the governments of our country are
identified with what they have done in a particular area or for a particular
community or group. Generally, the government and the people went by the
yardstick as to how much a government has given or to whom it has been
given. This was considered as good enough. May be it was the need of the
hour and a compulsion.

But despite whatever, however, whenever or whoever may have received in
the past, we now need to unitedly think about what dreams we want to
achieve as a nation. Time demands that we live fight and move ahead in
unison to fulfil these dreams. Keeping this in mind we have set a dream
target of building a five trillion dollar economy. 130 crore countrymen can
move together even with small contributions. The target of 5 trillion dollar
economy may appear difficult to some people. They may not be wrong but
if we don’t accomplish difficult tasks, how will the country moved ahead? If
we don’t take up difficult challenges how will we develop a mind set to
move forward? Psychologically also we must always aim high and that is
what we have done. This is not just in the air. We had reached a 2 trillion
dollar economy after 70 years of independence, after 70 years’ journey on
the path of development we could achieve just a 2 trillion dollar economy.
But within five years from 2014 to 2019 we reached a 3 trillion dollar
economy i.e we added one trillion dollars. If we succeeded in taking such a
big jump in just 5 years, then we can become a 5 trillion dollar economy in
the next five years. This must be a dream of every Indian.

When the economy grows, it brings better standard of living for the people.
Opportunities get created to fulfil the dreams of even of those at bottom. In
order to create these opportunities we have to develop this mind set about
the economic sector of the country.

When we dream to double the income of our farmers, when we dream that
after 75 years of independence each family, including the poorest of the
poor, should own a house, when we dream that on completing 75 years of
independence each family must get electricity in their house, when we
dream that on completing 75 years of independence each village of India
must have optical fibre network, broad band connectivity and long distance
education, these should no longer be seem to be dreams.

We must focus upon developing our maritime resources and blue economy.
We should empower our fishermen community. Our farmers, who provide
us food, may become energy givers. Why should they not become
exporters as well, why should the produce of our farmers not dominate the
international market? We want to move ahead with these dreams. Our
country will have to boost its export. Let us make every effort to reach the
global market.

Each district of our country has a potential equal to that of one country,
each of our districts has the capacity equal to a small country in the world.
We need to understand this power and channelize this potential. And why
should each district not think of becoming an export hub? Each district has
its own handicraft and each district has its unique specialities. If some
district is known for its perfumes then some other district may have saris as
its distinct identity whereas some other district is known for utensils and the
other district is famous for its sweets. Each of our districts has a diverse
identity and potential for global market.

We are trying to see how can we use zero defect zero effect in
manufacturing for global markets. If we focus on exports by making the
world aware of this diversity, and work towards capturing the world market,
then the youth of the country will get employment. This will give great
strength to our small scale and micro level industries. We have to increase
that strength.

Our country can be a fascinating tourist destination for the world, but for
some reason, we have not been able to do it as fast as we need to. Come,
let all of us, the countrymen, take the decision to boost tourism in the
country. As tourism grows, capital investment provides more employment
opportunities. The country's economy also gets a boost. People all over
the world are ready to see India in a new way today. Let us think how we
can attract tourists to our country from the world over, how we can
strengthen the tourism sector and what arrangements should be made at
tourist destinations. We should also talk about increasing the income of
ordinary citizens, better education for them, new employment opportunities.
There should be launching pads for the middle class people so that they
can realize their dreams. Our scientists should have the best facilities and
resources, our forces should have the best weapons and equipment that
too indigenously made. I believe that there are many areas which can give
India a new strength to become a five trillion dollar economy.

My dear brothers and sisters, today the country has a very favourable
environment for achieving economic success. When there is a stable
government, the policies are predictable and systems are stable, then the
world also starts having confidence in you. The people of the country have
shown this. The world is also watching India's political stability with great
pride and respect. We should not let this opportunity go. Today the world is
keen to do business with us. It wants to connect with us. Today, it is a
matter of great pride for us that while controlling inflation, we are moving
forward with an important equation to increase the growth rate. Sometimes
the growth rate may increase, but inflation is not under control. Sometimes
when the inflation is under control, the growth rate gets affected. But our
government has not only controlled inflation but has also increased the
growth rate.

The fundamentals of our economy are very strong. And this strength gives
us confidence to move ahead. In the same way, by developing a system
like GST, and bringing reforms like Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, we
want to develop an environment of confidence. There should be increased
production in our country, increased processing of our natural wealth, value
addition, export of the value added products to the world. Why can’t we
have a dream wherein every country in the world imports some or the other
Indian product, wherein every district of India exports some product? If we
take these two things into consideration, then we can also increase the
income. Our companies and entrepreneurs also dream of getting access to
the world market. By getting access to the world market, our investors will
be able to enhance the status of India; our investors will be able to earn
more; our investors will be able to invest more; our investors will be able to
generate more employment. We are completely ready to encourage our
investors to come forward for generating employment.

In our country, certain wrong beliefs have come into existence. We have to
come out of those mindset. Those who create wealth for the country, those
who contribute in the nation’s wealth creation are all serving the country.
We should not doubt our wealth creators.

The need of the hour is to recognise and encourage the wealth creators of
our nation. They should receive more honour. If wealth is not created,
wealth cannot be distributed. Further, if wealth is not distributed we cannot
uplift the poor sector of our society. Such is the importance of wealth
creation for our country which we need to facilitate further.

Those who are making efforts to create wealth, according to me they
themselves are an asset to the nation and must be empowered.

My dear Countrymen, today we are emphasising on peace and security
along with development. Globally, countries are gripped with several
insecurities. Death seems hovering in some or the other part of the world.

India has to play a vital role in reinstating world peace. We cannot remain
silent spectators in the global environment. We are putting up a tough fight
against terrorist organisations. In any part of the world, an act of terrorism
should be regarded as an attack on humanity. Therefore, I urge all forces to
unite against those who promote and give shelter to terrorist outfits. India
should contribute in exposing these anti-humanitarian activities and is
resolute to unite all world forces to end terrorism.

We want that India should play a crucial role in the war against terrorism.
India should unite all forces to expose those who give shelter to terrorists,
those who encourage terrorism and those who export terrorism.
Some terrorist organisations have not only targeted India, but are also
damaging our neighbouring countries. Bangladesh and Afghanistan are
also grappling with terrorist activities. In Sri Lanka, sadly, innocent people
have been killed en-masse inside a church. This is such a heart wrenching
event. Hence, we all have to unite and act proactively to bring security,
peace and harmony in this sub-continent.

Our friendly neighbour Afghanistan is also going to celebrate its 100th year
of independence, four days from now. I would like to extend my heartiest
greetings to them on this auspicious occasion.

It is our clear policy that those who are spreading fear and fostering
violence must be razed to the ground. We have made this clear through our
policies and strategies to curb all such malafide intentions. We have no
inhibitions. Our army, border security forces and security agencies have
done a commendable job. They always stand tall in their uniforms and
guard us from all adversities. They have martyred their lives to ensure a
bright future for us. I salute and I pay my homage to them. It is important
that we take timely steps towards reforms.

You must have noticed that deliberations are on since a long time to bring
reforms in military infrastructure, armed forces and military resources.
Previous governments have also discussed the same. Several
commissions have been formed and all the reports have brought to light the
same issues.

There is hardly any difference, but this has been stated repeatedly. There
indeed is coordination between our Navy, Army and Air Force. We can be
proud of the arrangement of our armed forces. Any Hindustani can be
proud of Indian Military. They also strive for modernity in their own way.

But the world is changing today, the scope of war is changing, the nature of
war is changing. It is becoming technology driven; in the circumstances
India too should not have a fragmented approach. Our entire military power
will have to work in unison and move forward. Things cannot move
smoothly if anyone from the Navy, Army and Air Force is a step ahead from
the other two forces, while the other two are lagging behind. All the three
should move simultaneously at the same pace. There should be good
coordination and it should be relevant with the hope and aspirations of our
people. It should be in line with the changing war and security environment
in the world and today I want to announce an important decision from Red
Fort. The subject experts on the issue have been demanding this for a long
time. Today we have decided that we will now have a Chief of Defence
Staff- CDS and after formation of this post all the three forces will get
effective leadership at the top level. The CDS System is a very important
and compelling task in our dream to reform the strategic pace of Hindustan
in the world.

My dear countrymen, we are lucky that we are born in such a period, we
are living in such a period, when we have the ability to do something.
Sometimes it comes to my mind that when we were fighting for freedom,
great men like Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru were competing for their
sacrifice. Under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi, freedom fighters were
going door-to-door, to awaken the country to realize their dreams of
independence. We were not born at that time. We did not get a chance to
sacrifice for the country, but we have definitely got a chance to live for the
country now. And it is a privilege that this period is like this, this year is very
important for us. This is the festival of 150th birth anniversary of Bapu
Mahatma Gandhi.

We feel blessed to have such opportunity. 75 years of our Independence
and the remembrance of those who sacrificed for the country, inspires us to
do something. We should capitalise on this opportunity. We, 130 crore of
countrymen, have to move further, to achieve the dreams of Mahatma
Gandhi, the dreams of freedom fighters of the country. We should make
the 75 years of independence and 150 years of Gandhi into a festival. This
is a great opportunity for our inspiration.

I had spoken about Swachhata in 2014 from this Red Fort. I am confident
that within next few weeks of 2019 itself India will declare itself Open
Defecation Free. States, Villages, Municipalities, Media, everyone has
started Mass-Movement regarding ODF. The government was nowhere to
be seen, people participated in the mass movement and the results are
quite evident.

My dear countrymen, I would like to put forward a small request to you. On
this 2 October can we make India free from single- use plastic? Let us
move around, form teams and move out from home, school, college.

Remembering revered Bapu, we should move out of home collecting
single-use plastic from homes, streets, chowks, and drains. Municipalities,
Municipal corporations, Gram Panchayat should make arrangements to
collect single-use plastic. Can we take first big step on 2nd October,
towards making India free from single-use plastic?

Come my countrymen, let us take this forward.

I will request start-up organizations, technicians and entrepreneurs to see
what we can do to recycle this plastic? Plastic is being used in making
highways. Many such remedies can be there. But to get rid of such
problems we have to initiate mass movement but at the same time we have
to think of the alternate systems. I will request all shopkeepers along with
many sign boards in your shop please also put another one exhorting
customers not to use plastic bags; that they should instead bring their own
cloth bags or buy cloth bags for carrying their goods. Let us create an
environment. We generally give gifts to people on Diwali. Why not pack
those gifts in cloth bags this year and every time? If people go to market
with cloth bags, that will be an advertisement for your company too. If you
give a diary or calendar nothing will happen. But if you give a bag, that will
be a medium of your advertisement. It should be a jute bag. It will help
farmers. The cloth bag will help famers. These are all small things. It will
help poor widows who are into sewing. Our small steps can change the
lives of ordinary people and we have to work towards that.
My dear countrymen, whether it is a five trillion economy dream or the
dream of a self-reliant India, we are following the principles of Mahatma
Gandhi. Mahatma Gandhi’s ideals are relevant even today. So we have to
take forward our ‘Make in India’ mission. Shouldn’t made in India products
be our priority? Let us decide whatever is produced and available in our
country should be our priority. We have to give stress on local products for
lucky tomorrow; we have to go for local for bright future. Whatever is
produced in the village should be given priority. If it is not available in the
village we have to go beyond that- to Tehsil, to the district and then to the
state level. I don’t think that one has to go outside the state to meet one’s
requirements. Our rural economy will get a boost; our small entrepreneurs
will get a boost; our traditional things will get a fillip.

Brothers and sisters we like mobile phones, we like to send whatsapp
messages, we like to be on Facebook-twitter. But we can help country’s
economy through these means. Technology is useful for the people who
know its usefulness. Technology is helpful for the development of a modern
India. Why shouldn’t we move towards Digital payment? Today we are
proud that our RuPay card is accepted in Singapore. In the near future
RuPay card will be accepted in more countries. Our digital platform is
spreading steadily. Shouldn’t we stress on digital payment in villages, small
shops and small shopping malls? For the sake of honesty, transparency
and to make our country’s economy strong let us move towards digital
payment. If you go to villages you will generally see boards put up by
traders saying “only cash, no credit please”. I will urge the businessmen to
display another board: “say yes to digital payment and no to cash”. We
should create an atmosphere like this. I will urge the banking sector and the
people from the business world to give emphasis on these things.

In our country the bulk of middle class and higher middle class are
increasing. This is a good thing. People go to various countries as a tourist
with their family once or twice in a year. It is good that our children get
exposure. But today I want to urge all such families to think over whether
they will want their children to know their country as well, when it celebrates
the 75th Year of its Independence, which could be achieved after many
great men and women had sacrificed their lives? Are there any parents
who do not want their children to be emotionally connected with the
country’s soil, its history, its air and water? Do they not want their children
to gather new energy from all these? We have to move ahead in right
earnest. No matter how advanced we become, if we get cut off from our
roots, we can never survive. Today from the ramparts of Red Fort, I am
asking you one thing. This is to generate employment of the youth, to build
an image of India in the world and to tell the world what India is capable of.
It is time you decide that before 2022, when India will be celebrating the
75th Year of its Independence, we take our families to at least 15 tourist
destinations in the country. We may face some difficulties in those places
but still, you should go. There may not be good hotels. But, sometimes
such difficulties also bring opportunities along. Our children will learn what
their country is, when they visit such tourist destinations. The people who
can build facilities will also reach there and that will generate employment.
Why don’t we develop 100 good tourist destinations, why shouldn’t there be
target of developing 2, 5 or 7 top class tourist destinations in every state?
North-East of India has huge natural resources but how many universities
make that part of the country as their tourist destination? You do not have
to spend much, neither do have you need to spend a lot of time; in 7 to 10
days you can visit within the country.

 A new world will come into being in the places you visit. You will get bliss
in the life once we Indians visit the tourist spots of North-East, foreigners
will also follow suit. But, think over when we go out of the country and the
people there ask, whether you have seen that temple in Tamil Nadu and we
say ‘’No’’; then how does it feel. They would be surprised and say that they
being foreigners, have visited that temple but you being an Indian have not
seen it so far. So, before we go abroad we must know our country well.

Now, I want to ask something from my farmer brothers. For farmers, for my
countrymen this country is their motherland. As we chant ‘Bharat Mata Ki
Jai” our hearts are filled with new energy.
The word “Vande Mataram’’ enthuses our hearts with a wish to sacrifice for
the country. A long history beckons us. But have we ever cared to think
about our motherland’s health? The way we are using chemical fertilizers
and pesticides, it is damaging the health of its soil. As a farmer, as a child
of this soil, I have no right to damage its health. I have no right to make my
mother India sad nor do have I right to make her sick.

We would soon complete 75 years since our Independence.

Revered Bapu showed us the way. Should we not cut down the use of
chemical fertilizer in our fields by 10% or 20% or 25% and if possible
should we not launch a Muktikar Abhiyan (campaign)?. This would be a
great service to the nation. This would be a great step in saving our Mother
Earth. Your endeavour in saving our mother earth will also get blessings of
those who dedicated their lives chanting Vande Mataram in order to fulfil
the dream of achieving freedom for our motherland. Therefore I appeal to
you as I am fully confident that my countrymen will definitely be able to
achieve this. My farmers will fulfil this request of mine because I have full
trust in them.

My dear brothers and sisters, professionals of our country are at a
commanding position globally. Their potential is very well recognised.
People respect them. Be it space, be it technology, we have achieved new
heights. It’s a matter of happiness of us that our Chandrayaan is moving
speedily towards that part of the moon where no one has ever reached.
Such is the mastery of our scientists.

Similarly, our presence was much less in the field of sports. Today young
sons and daughters of my country in the age group of 18 to 22 are making
India’s tricolor fly in various sports stadia. How proud that feels! Our
sportspersons are earning laurels for the country.

Dear countrymen, we have to take our country forward. We have to
transform our country. We have to make our country reach newer heights
and we have to do this collectively. The government and the people have to
achieve this collectively and jointly. Our 130 crore countrymen have to do
this. Prime Minister of the country is also a child of this country like you
and he also is a citizen of the country. We all have to work unitedly for this.

In the coming days about 1.5 lakh wellness centres and health centres will
have to be set up in rural areas. Setting up one medical college for every
three Lok Sabha constituencies will make us realize the dream of our youth
becoming doctors. Houses for more than 2 crore poor people have to be
built. We have to supply potable drinking water to 15 crore houses in rural
areas, construct 1.25 km roads in rural areas. Each village has to be
provided with Broad Band connectivity and connected with optical fibre
network, also a network of more than 50000 new start-ups has to be raised.
We need to move forward with so many dreams.

And, therefore, brothers and sisters, we the countrymen have to collectively
take our country forward with these dreams in mind and for this 75 years of
independence is a very big motivation.

130 crore countrymen have their dreams, their challenges. Each dream
and each challenge has its own importance. It is not that some is more
important and the other is less important. It may not be possible for me to
delve at all the topics during this speech. So, whatever I could speak today
and whatever I could not speak are equally important. If we move forward,
we should keep in mind that we have to take our country forward.

75 years of Independence, 150 years of Gandhi and 70 years of India’s
Constitution has been completed for realising the dream of Baba Saheb
Ambedkar. We are also celebrating 550th Parv of Guru Nanak Dev ji this
year. Let us move ahead following the teachings of Baba Saheb Ambedker
and Guru Nanak Dev ji as we have to build a better society and a better
country as per the expectations of the whole world.

My dear brothers and sisters, we know that our targets are as high as the
Himalayas, our dreams are even more than the innumerable stars. But we
also know that even skies cannot check the flight of our courage.
This is our resolve, our potential is beyond measure just like the Indian
Ocean. Our efforts are holy like the flowing Ganges and are ever
continuing. Above all these things our values draw inspiration from our
ancient culture and the penance of our sages and saints. The sacrifice and
hard work of our countrymen is our motivation.

Come on, let us move ahead to build a new India keeping these ideals and
resolves in mind. Fulfilling our responsibilities with a new confidence and a
new resolve to build a new India should be our mantra. Let us together take
our country forward with this single expectation, I once again bow to
everyone who lived, fought, died for the country.

Jai Hind.

Jai Hind.

Bharat Mata ki Jai.

Bharat Mata ki Jai.

Vande Mataram

Vande Mataram

Thank you very very much."
2018,Narendra Modi,BJP,NA,"English rendering of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s address to the Nation from the ramparts of the Red Fort on the 72nd Independence Day- August, 15, 2018",Press Information Bureau,https://pib.gov.in/,"My dear countrymen, I convey my best wishes to all of you on this
auspicious occasion of Independence Day. Today, the country is brimming
with self-confidence. The country is scaling new heights by working
extremely hard, with a resolve to realize its dreams. Today’s dawn has
brought a new spirit, a new enthusiasm, a new zeal and a new energy with
it.

My dear countrymen, in our country, there is a Neelakurinji flower which
blooms once every 12 years. This year, Neelakurinji is in full bloom on the
hills of Southern Nilgiri like the Ashok Chakra (the wheel of Ashoka) in the
Tricolour on our Independence Day.

My dear countrymen, we are celebrating this festival of independence at a
time when our daughters from the states of Uttarakhand, Himachal
Pradesh, Manipur, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, have come back after
circumnavigating the seven seas. They have returned after unfurling the
Tricolour in the seven seas, colouring their waters with the hues of our
Tricolor.

My dear countrymen, we are celebrating this festival of independence at a
time when the Mount Everest has been conquered many times; several
brave-hearts and many of our daughters have unfurled the Tricolour atop
the Mount Everest. However, during this festival of independence, I will
remember our young tribal children from remote forest areas, who have
unfurled the Tricolour on the Mount Everest, further enhancing its glory.

My dear countrymen, the sessions of the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha
have concluded recently, and you would have seen that the proceedings
were conducted in a very orderly manner, and in a way, they were entirely
dedicated to the cause of social justice.

Displaying utmost sensitivity and alertness, our Parliament has made the
social justice framework stronger to protect the interests of the weaker
sections of society – be it a Dalit, a deprived or exploited person or women.

The demand to confer constitutional status on the OBC Commission had
existed for years. This time, our Parliament has accorded Constitutional
status to this Commission, and in doing so, has made an efforts to protect
the interests of the Backward and the Most Backward classes.

Today, we are celebrating the festival of independence at a time when
news reports have brought in a new consciousness in the country. Today,
every Indian, living in any nook and corner of the world, takes pride in the
fact that India has become the sixth largest economy of the world. We are
celebrating this Independence Day in a positive atmosphere amidst such
positive chain of events.

Under the leadership of respected Bapu, lakhs of people sacrificed their
lives and spent their youth in prisons to win freedom for our country. Many
great revolutionaries embraced the gallows bravely. Today on behalf of my
countrymen, I pay homage to those brave freedom fighters and salute them
from the bottom of my heart. Our soldiers and Paramilitary forces lay down
their lives to uphold the dignity of the tricolour that inspires us to hold our
heads high through life and death. Our Police forces serve the country day
and night to provide safety and security to the people.

From the ramparts of the Red Fort with the Tricolour as witness, I salute all
the soldiers of the army, the para-military forces and the police for their
dedicated service, valour and hard work. My best wishes are always with
them.

These days, we are receiving the news of good rainfall as well as floods
from different parts of the country. I want to reassure the people who have
lost their loved ones and are in distress, that the country is with them in
their hour of crisis to help them overcome this difficult situation. I share the
grief of those who have lost their near and dear ones in this natural
calamity.

My dear countrymen,

The next year will mark 100 years of the Jallianwallah Bagh massacre. Our
masses had sacrificed their lives for the country's freedom at a time when
atrocities had crossed all limits. The Jallianwallah Bagh incident reminds us
of the sacrifices made by the brave hearts and is an inspiration to us. I
salute all the brave people from the depths of my heart.

My dear countrymen,

Our freedom has come at a price. Under the leadership of Bapu and the
revolutionaries, many heroes, many satyagrahis, brave men and women
and youth participated in the freedom struggle of the country. While striving
for the country’s freedom, they suffered imprisonment and spent the prime
of their youth in jails, yet they nurtured the dreams of a glorious India even
through all the suffering.

Many years ago, the national poet from Tamil Nadu, Subramaniam Bharti
translated his vision of the country into words

“ए ला म ् अमर नलई आईडुमनान

मरु ईअई इं दया उला ग र कु अ ल कुम”.

– ( “Ellarum amarnillai aaedumnaan

   muraiai India ulagirakku allikkum”).

What was the dream that he envisioned after Independence? Subramania
Bharti said that India will show the way for the entire world to break free
from every form of bondage.
My dear countrymen,

After Independence, in order to realize the dreams of such great
personalities, to meet the aspirations of freedom fighters and to fulfill the
hopes and expectations of the citizens of the country, India drafted an
inclusive Constitution under the leadership of respected Baba Saheb
Ambedkar ji. This inclusive Constitution is the harbinger of a resolve to
build a New India. It has brought with it some responsibilities for us and
has also set a few boundaries on us. Our Constitution has been guiding us
in realizing our dreams by stating that every section of the society and
every geographical part of India must get an equal opportunity in the quest
to forge ahead.

Dear brothers and sisters,

The Constitution also guides us to draw inspiration from our Tricolor. It
indicates that we should ensure justice for the poor, equal opportunity for
all to move ahead, our lower middle class, middle class and higher middle
class should not face any obstacle in their growth, the Government should
not come in the way, social systems should not curb their dreams. We
should create an enabling environment that provides them maximum
opportunities to grow and blossom, and they should be allowed to flourish
without limitation.

Be it our elderly, differently-abled, our women, marginalized or deprived
people, or our Adivasi brethren living in the forests, everyone must get an
opportunity to grow, as per their hopes and aspirations. We aspire for an
India that is strong and self-reliant, a nation that maintains a steady pace of
progress, an India that keeps scaling new heights; an India that enjoys
goodwill in the world. Not only this, we want that India should also shine in
the world – we want to build such an India.
My dear countrymen, I have shared my vision for TEAM INDIA earlier too.
When 125 crore countrymen become partners, then each and every citizen
joins us in the progress of the country. When 125 crore dreams, 125 crore
resolves, 125 crore efforts, move in the right direction to attain desired
goals then nothing is unattainable.

Dear brothers and sisters, with utmost humility and respect, I would like to
share that in 2014, 125 crore citizens did not rest after voting for the
Government. The citizens did not stop at government formation, but
worked to build the nation. They have come together, were together and
will continue to be together. I feel that this synergy of 125 crore active
citizens from more than 6 lakhs villages is the real strength of our nation.
Today, we celebrate the birth anniversary of Shri Aurobindo. He said
something very pertinent – What is Nation? What is our Motherland? It is
not a mere piece of land, not just an identity, nor is it a figment of
imagination. The Nation is a repository of a great force manifested through
many organized units to give it a concrete shape. It is this thought of Sri
Aurobindo which is uniting the country and taking it ahead. That we are
actually moving ahead is difficult to comprehend unless we know from
where we started. If we don’t look at from where we began our journey, it
will not be possible to assess how far we have come. Precisely for this
reason, if we consider 2013 as the base year and take into consideration
the work that has been done in the last four years, you will be surprised to
see the speed at which the country is moving and the pace at which the
progress is being made. Take the case of toilets. If we had continued with
the same speed of constructing toilets as in 2013, then to achieve 100%
target would have taken decades.

If we talk about providing electricity to villages on the basis of work done in
2013, it would have taken a couple of more decades to accomplish this
work. If we talk about providing smoke free LPG gas connection to the poor
and to the poor mothers, at the rate in which it was done in 2013, it could
not have been completed even in a 100 years. If we had maintained the
speed of 2013 in laying optical fibre network in villages, then we would not
have been able to accomplish the task for generations together. We will
strive to maintain the same pace of development.

Brothers and sisters, the country has huge expectations, the country has a
lot of requirements and to fulfill those, it is imperative for the central
government and the state governments to work together steadily and
continuously. Today, we can see a sea change in the country although the
country is same, the soil is same, the wind is same, the sky is same, the
sea is same, the government offices are same, the files are same and the
decision making process remains the same. However, the country has
been experiencing change for the last four years. A new spirit, new energy,
new resolve, new determination and new inspiration is taking the country
forward. This is why the country has doubled the pace of construction of
the highways. The construction of new houses has gone up four times in
the villages. The food production in the country today has reached an
all-time high; there has been a record production of mobile phones; the
sale of tractors has touched a new high. On the one hand, a record
number of tractors are being bought by our farmers today, at the same
time, the country has witnessed a record number of aeroplane purchases
since independence. Toilets are being built in schools; new IIMs, new IITs
and new AIIMS are being established. Giving momentum to Skill
Development Missions, the country is setting up new centers in small
towns. At the same time, our tier-2 and tier-3 cities are being flooded with
start-up enterprises, bringing regeneration.

Brothers and Sisters, Digital India is now making inroads into our villages.
As a government sensitive to the needs of people, efforts are being made
to turn Digital India into a reality. At the same time, work is also progressing
with the same dedication to compile dictionary and common signs for my
differently-abled brothers and sisters. While on the one hand, our farmers
are working on modern agricultural techniques like micro irrigation, drip
irrigation and sprinklers, on the other hand, 99 big closed irrigation projects
have also been revived. Our soldiers reach out to provide relief and rescue
operations during natural calamities. While our soldiers display exemplary
courage in reaching out to rescue the people in difficulties, they have also
shown a steely resolve to carry out surgical strikes and vanquish our
enemies.

Take a glance at the vast canvass of the development in our country- from
one end to the other, one can witness the progress of the country that is
moving ahead with new energy and enthusiasm. I hail from Gujarat. There
is a saying in Gujarati ‘Nishan Chuk Maaf Lekin Nahi Maaf Nichu Nishan’
which means one should have big aims and dreams. However, for that, one
has to strive hard and be answerable. But if the aims are not big, targets
are not far-sighted, decisions are also not taken. Development comes to a
halt. That is why my dear brothers and sisters, it is necessary for us to
move ahead with big aims and resolve. When targets are vague, when the
spirit is not strong, then important decisions in our social life also get held
up for years. Take for instance the case of MSP - economists, farmer
organizations, farmers as well as political parties had been demanding, that
farmers should get an MSP which is one and a half times of their
investment. The matter was debated for years, files moved to and fro, and
but was stuck. Finally, we took the decision. We took a bold decision of
giving the farmers the MSP which is one and half times their investment.

There was unanimity on GST. Everyone wanted GST but they could not
arrive at a decision because while on the subject, they were thinking in
terms of their vested interests and whether this will translate into electoral
gains. Today, with the help of small traders, their open mindedness and
their attitude of accepting the new, the country has implemented GST. A
new found confidence has been generated in the business community.
The small entrepreneurs, small businessmen who faced teething difficulties
in adopting GST, accepted the challenge and the country is now moving
ahead.
Today, we have enacted laws on Insolvency and Bankruptcy to strengthen
the banking sector. Who opposed them earlier? Taking decisions requires
conviction, force, confidence and complete dedication to the good of the
common man. Why was the Benami property law not enforced earlier? The
Benami property laws are implemented only when there is courage and a
determination to do something for the country. The Jawans of our defence
forces were demanding one-rank one-pension for several decades. They
were not resorting to agitation because they are disciplined, but nobody
was paying heed to their voices. Somebody needed to take a decision in
this regard. You gave us the responsibility of taking this decision and we
fulfilled it positively.

My dear brothers and sisters,

We are not the kind of people who work in the interest of the party. We are
capable of taking tough decisions because national interest is topmost in
our priority.

My dear brothers and sisters,

In this era of global economy, the entire world is looking at every
development in India - big or small, with deep interest and hope and
expectations. You may recall the comments made about India prior to
2014, by eminent international institutions, top economists of the world, and
by those considered authorities on the subject. There was a time when the
Indian economy was considered risky by experts. But now the same
experts and the institutions have expressed confidence that our reform
momentum has strengthened our economic fundamentals. How have
things changed? There was a time when the world used to comment about
red tape in India but now they talk about Red Carpet. We have reached
the 100th spot in Ease of Doing Business ranking. Today, the entire world
is looking at this achievement with pride. There was a time when the world
perceived India as a country with ‘policy paralysis’ and ‘delayed reforms’.
Old newspaper clippings confirm this view. However, today the world
opinion about India has changed and they talk about our focus on reform,
perform and transform. This follows from a series of time bound policy
decisions. There was a time when the world counted India among the
‘fragile five’. They were concerned that India was pulling down the world
economy but now their tone has changed as India has become a
multi-trillion dollar investment destination.

My dear brothers and sisters,

While engaging with India, the investors used to bemoan the lack of
infrastructure, the blackouts due to power shortage and the bottlenecks.
The same set of experts who had earlier dubbed India as a ‘sleeping
elephant’ are now saying that ‘sleeping elephant’ has woken up and started
running. Economists and international institutions are saying that India will
provide momentum to the world economy for the next three decades and
will spur the growth of the world.

Today, India's stature at International fora has risen greatly. India’s voice is
being heard in every organization of which she is a member. India is
playing a crucial role in shaping up the discourse and providing leadership
to these organizations. We are raising our voice at international fora.

My dear countrymen, for years, we waited seeking membership to some
international organizations, but today, our country has become a member
of innumerable organizations. Today, India offers a ray of hope for those
who are concerned with environmental issues and global warming. Today
India has become the flag bearer of International Solar Alliance in the
world. Today, every country of the world is keen to welcome any Indian
stepping on its soil. A new consciousness is visible in their eyes, when they
look at an Indian. The strength of the Indian passport has multiplied
manifold. This has instilled a new self-confidence, fresh energy and a
resolve in every Indian to move ahead with new hope.
My dear countrymen, if an Indian is in trouble or distress in any part of the
world, he can rest assured that his country is with him at every step.
Several recent incidents bear testimony to this fact.

My dear countrymen, just as the perspective of the world towards India has
transformed, similarly, there was a time when the news from India's
North-Eastern part used to be dominated with content that one wished
were not there. However, today my dear brothers and sisters, North-East is
coming up with positive and inspiring stories. North-East today is shining in
the field of sports.

My dear brothers and sisters, today we are receiving news from North-East
that the last village has been electrified and the entire village danced the
whole night. We are hearing more such news from the North East about
highways, railways, airways, waterways and information ways (i-ways)
coming to the region. The work of installing electric transmission lines
across the North-East is progressing at a rapid pace. Today youth from the
North-East are establishing BPOs in the region. Today, new educational
institutions are being set up and the North-East India is becoming the new
hub for organic farming. North-East is going to host the Sports University.

Brothers and sisters, there was a time when the North-East used to feel
that Delhi is very distant. Within four years, we have brought Delhi to the
doorsteps of North-East.

Brothers and sisters, today, about 65% of the population in the country is
below 35 years of age. We are proud of our country's youth. Our country's
youngsters have completely transformed the meaning of all standards of
the economy. They have infused new colours to the country's standard of
progress. There was a time when only big cities used to hog all the
limelight. Today, our country is talking about Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities and
paying attention to the youngsters engaged in modern agriculture in the
rural areas. The youth of our country has completely transformed the
nature of jobs. Today the youngsters of the country are taking the nation to
greater heights by exploring and engaging in new fields such as Start-ups,
BPOs, E-commerce, mobility etc.

My dear countrymen, 13 crore Mudra Loans has been a major
achievement. More so, if it includes 4 crore youth who have taken the loan
for the first time with the aspiration to become self-reliant and are
promoting self-employment. This in itself is a great example of the
changing ecosystem. In an endeavor to realize the dream of Digital India,
several Common Service Centres are being managed by young girls and
boys in more than 3 lakhs villages today. These centres are rendering
“on-the-click global connect”/”anytime-anywhere connectivity” services to
every citizen in the villages with the optimal utilization of Information
Technology.

Talking about infrastructure, whether it be speed of rails, roads, I-ways,
highways or a new airport, our nation is witnessing fast paced
development.

Brothers and Sisters, scientists of our nation have also left no stone
unturned in bringing immense glory to our country. In the global context, as
well as fulfilling the requirements of the country, it is a matter of great pride
that our scientists launched more than 100 satellites in one go leaving the
world astonished. That’s the capability of Indian scientists which has made
the world stand up and applaud. Successful launch of Mangalyaan in the
very first attempt itself stands as testimony to the expertise and endeavors
of our scientists. This feat of successful in orbit launch of Mangalyaan
speaks volumes about the capabilities of our scientists. In days to come,
thanks to the futuristic vision, innovativeness and creativity of our scientists
we are confident of launching NavIC, the first indigenous Indian Regional
Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS). This navigation system will guide
fishermen and other citizens through Satellite signals.
My dear countrymen, today from the ramparts of the Red Fort, I am
delighted to share a good news. Our country is undoubtedly progressing
fast in its space missions. However, we have a dream; our scientists have
a dream. We have resolved that by 2022, when India celebrates 75 years
of Independence or maybe even before that, certainly some of our young
boys and girls will unfurl the Tricolour in space. With Mangalyaan our
scientists have proved their capabilities. I feel proud to announce that very
soon as a part of our Manned-Space mission, we shall be sending an
Indian into space. This will be done through the pursuit of our esteemed
scientists, and we will proudly find ourselves as the fourth such nation to
have launched a successful Man Space Mission.

Dear brothers and sisters, I would like to congratulate our scientists and
technicians for such a great accomplishment. Today our warehouses are
filled with food grains. I sincerely acknowledge the role of our agricultural
scientists, cultivators and farmers in successfully steering the green
revolution across decades.

But my brothers and sisters, times have changed now. Our farmers and the
agricultural markets have to face global challenges and competition. As the
population increases, land falls short. Hence, the changing times demand
that our agricultural methods should also be modern and more scientific;
we have to take the process forward with technology. Precisely for this
reason we are focusing on change and bringing in modern methods in the
agricultural sector.

We have a vision to double the farmers’ income by the 75th year of
Independence. Some people have doubts, which is quite natural, but we
are determined. Hum makkhan par lakeer nahi, patthar par lakeer
kheenchne waale hain (We don’t promise things lightly, we mean to keep
our word). To keep our promises, we have to work hard, we have to plan
and we have to put our heart and soul into fulfilling it. So in order to realize
this promise by 75th year of Independence, we want to move along with the
farmers in that direction by bringing modernity and diversity in agricultural
sector. We want to bring value addition right from seeds to marketing. We
want to modernize. Some new crops are giving record yields. For the first
time we are moving towards agriculture export policy so that our farmers
can also face global competition with confidence. Today we can see a new
agricultural revolution. Organic farming, Blue revolution, sweet revolution
and solar farming have opened up new vistas.

It is a matter of great satisfaction that today our country is the second
highest fish producer in the world and is on the verge of reaching the top
position soon. The export of honey has doubled. The sugarcane farmers
are happy that ethanol production has tripled. It means, in rural economy
other businesses allied to agriculture are also as important as agriculture.
We are developing village resources by spending crores of rupees through
women self help groups.

Khadi is associated with the name of respected Bapu. I want to humbly
submit that the sale of khadi products since independence has doubled.
This has generated employment for the poor.

My brothers and sisters, the farmers of my country are emphasizing on
solar farming now. Apart from farming, they can earn money by selling
power generated through solar farming. The people who spin charkha, the
people who are associated with handloom are also earning their livelihood.

My dear brothers and sisters, economic development in our country is
important, but more than anything else, human dignity is supreme. Without
human dignity, no country can move forward in a balanced way. So to
protect human dignity, we have to move ahead with those schemes which
will ensure respectable lives for people. The policies, traditions and
intentions should be such that ordinary people, including the poorest of the
poor can get a chance to live with equal dignity.
So we have provided gas connection to the poor through Ujjawala Yojana.
We have provided electricity to the poor through Saubhagya Yojana. We
are emphasizing on moving ahead with the concept of ‘Shrameva Jayate’.

Only yesterday, we heard the President’s address to the nation. He
described in great detail the Gram Swaraj Abhiyan. Whenever, there is talk
about Government, it is said that policies are framed but there is no last
mile delivery. The President described well how this campaign that was
launched in Delhi has now spread to 65000 villages in aspirational districts,
to the huts of the poor; how it is working in the backward villages.

My dear countrymen, when I talked about cleanliness from the Ramparts of
Red Fort in 2014, some people made fun. Some of them even said the
Government had many things to do, why is it wasting its energy on an issue
like cleanliness. But my dear brothers and sisters, in a recent report the
WHO has said that because of the cleanliness campaign three lakh
children were saved. The credit for saving lives of three lakh children goes
to every Indian who was a part of this campaign. Saving the lives of three
lakh children of the poor is surely a great humanitarian act and the world
bodies are recognizing it.

Brothers and Sisters, Mahatma Gandhi’s 150th Birth Anniversary falls next
year. Bapu during his lifetime attached greater importance to cleanliness
than even to freedom. He used to say we got our freedom because of
Satyagrahisand Swachchata (cleanliness) will come from Swachchagrahis.
Gandhiji trained Satyagrahis and this inspired us to prepare
Swachchagrahis. In the coming days, when we will be celebrating his
150th Birth Anniversary, crores of Swachchagrahis will offer Karyanjali
(offerings of work) in the memory of Bapu. In a way, they will fulfil his
dreams which we are realizing now.

My Brothers and Sisters, it is true that because of cleanliness, lives of three
lakh children have been saved. But no matter how happy a middle class
family is and how well-to-do it is or how poor it is, once a family member
falls sick, the whole family suffers. On occasions generations are afflicted
with illnesses.

The Government of India has decided to launch Pradhanmantri Jan Arogya
Abhiyan so that the poor man, the common man gets free treatment for
serious diseases and he can be admitted to big hospitals free of cost. The
Pradhanmantri Jan Arogya Abhiyan and Ayushman Bharat Yojana will
cover 10 crore families of the country. In the coming days, the people from
lower middle class, middle class and upper middle class income groups
can also access health care services from these two programs. There is a
provision of giving five lakh rupees per annum health assurance for each
family. It means about fifty crore citizens belonging to ten crore families will
benefit. We are going to give this benefit to our countrymen. This is a
technology driven system which is transparent. As such, an ordinary citizen
will not face any difficulty as technology technological tools have been built
for this purpose.

Over the next four, five, six weeks from today, this technology will be tested
across the country to make it fool proof. On the 25th of September, the
birth anniversary of Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyaya, the Pradhanmantri Jan
Arogya Abhiyan will be launched throughout the country. No poor person of
the country will have to face difficulty in dealing with diseases. Nor he
would have to borrow money from a moneylender paying interest. His
family will not be destroyed. And it will also open new avenues of
employment for the youth, for the middle class families in the health sector.
New hospitals will be built in the tier-2 and tier-3 cities. They will require
medical staff in large numbers. A lot of employment opportunities will also
be generated.

Brothers and sisters, no poor person wants to lead a life of penury. No poor
person wants to die poor. No poor person wants to pass on his poverty as
a legacy to his children. Throughout his life, he struggles to come out of
poverty. There is only one way to end this problem- through the
empowerment of poor people.

In the last four years, we have laid emphasis on empowerment of poor
people. It has been our endeavour to empower the poor people. An
international organization has released a very good report in the recent
past. According to the report, five crore poor people in India have crossed
the Poverty Line in the last two years.

Brothers and sisters, when we carry out the work for the empowerment of
poor people; and when I talked about Ayushman Bharat Program, then
very few people realized the massive size of the scheme, – 10 crore
families or a population of 50 crore people, very few people were able to
grasp what it means. If I combine the population of America (USA), Canada
and Mexico, then the number of beneficiaries of Ayushman Bharat Program
will be nearly the same. If I take into account the population of entire
Europe, then nearly the same number of people are going to get the
benefits of this Ayushman Bharat scheme in India.

Brothers and sisters, we have formulated several schemes for
empowerment of the poor. Although many schemes have been formulated
in the past, middlemen, the people who take cuts, used to take away the
cream of the scheme. The poor people didn’t get what rightfully belonged to
them. Money was being paid from the exchequer, the schemes existed on
paper, and the country continued to be robbed. The Government cannot
keep its eyes shut. And, at least I can never keep my eyes shut to this kind
of thing.

Brothers and sisters, therefore it is extremely essential to create confidence
in the minds of the common man by eliminating the deformities in our
system. And whether it is the state governments or the centre or whether
these are the local bodies of self-rule, we all have to work together. And we
will have to take it forward. You will be surprised to know that since the time
we have been engaged in this campaign for cleansing the system, and
plugging leakages; there were six crore bogus beneficiaries who had never
been born, who never existed on the earth but the money was being sent in
their names - somebody was the beneficiary of Ujjwala Scheme, some
beneficiary of the gas connection scheme with a duplicate gas connection;
somebody was taking benefits through bogus ration cards; somebody was
the beneficiary of scholarship scheme; someone else was the beneficiary
of pension scheme. How difficult it would have been to remove these six
crore names! How many people would have faced problems because of
this ! The person who was never born, the person who doesn’t exist
anywhere on the earth, but the money was pilfered on his name by using
bogus names.

This government has put an end to it. We have taken steps in the direction
of curbing corruption and putting an end to the entire system of black
money.

Brothers and sisters, what are the consequences of it? Rs.90,000 crores is
not a small amount. Almost Rs.90,000 crores, which used to go into the
hands of wrong people for wrong activities, is now in the nation's treasury,
now being used for the welfare of common man.

Brothers and sisters, why does it happen? Our country works for the pride
and honour of the poor people, but what do these middlemen do? You
must be aware of the fact that wheat is sold at Rs. 24-25 (per kilo) in the
market, but the government provides it to the poor at only Rs.2 on ration
card after buying it at Rs.24-25. Similarly, rice which is sold at Rs.30-32 in
the market is purchased by the Government at this rate and provided to the
poor at Rs.3 on ration cards. This means if anyone steals 1 kg of wheat on
a bogus ration card, he automatically gains Rs.20-25. If gets rice in this
manner, he will get Rs 30-35. That's why this entire business of bogus
names and IDs had been going on. When a poor person used to approach
the shop with his ration card and request grain, the shopkeeper would say
that the stock was over. That grain then used to be diverted to another
shop and the poor had to purchase the grain of Rs.2 from the other shop at
Rs.20-25. The right of the poor used to be snatched away. Therefore, this
bogus system has now been uprooted.

Brothers and sisters, crores of poor people in our country get food at Rs.2
and Rs.3. The government is spending generously for the same but the
credit does not go to the government. Today I want to specifically tell the
honest taxpayers that when you have your food with your family, for a
moment kindly ponder over what I am about to say. I want to touch the
hearts of the honest taxpayers. I want to salute them. I want to reassure the
honest taxpayers that all the schemes that are in operation are run by your
money. The honest tax payers gain good fortune because the poor get to
eat from the taxpayers’ money. Therefore, it is the result of your honest
paying of taxes when you have your meal with your family, 3 poor families
are also able to have their meals at the same time.

Friends, an atmosphere of non-payment of taxes was being created.
However, when a person, even if he is in an AC room, comes to know that
3 poor families are being served with his tax money, it is highly satisfying
for his soul. This is the most virtuous task for a person. Brothers and
sisters, today, the country is moving ahead celebrating the festival of
honesty. Till 2013, i.e. for the last 70 years, there were 4 crore people who
were paying direct taxes. However brothers and sisters, today this figure
has increased to almost 6.75 crore. Look how far we have come from 3, 3.5
or 3.75 crore to 6.75 crore. Are not these glaring figures a true reflection of
honesty? This is an example that nation is treading the path of honesty. In
the past 70 years, 70 lakh enterprises were included in the Indirect tax net.
However, in the last one year alone, after the introduction of GST, the
figure has catapulted to one crore and 16 lakh. Brothers and sisters, today
everyone in the country is participating in celebrating the festival of
honesty. I salute all those who are embracing transparency and honesty. I
wish to reassure those who want to step forward. You are making a
contribution in the nation’s progress. Your problems are our concerns. We
stand with you, for we have to take the nation forward through everyone’s
contribution. Therefore, we will not tolerate black money and corruption.
Come what may, we shall not retract from the path of honesty, as we all
have seen how they have corroded and ruined the nation. Thus, you would
have seen that power-brokers are not to be seen in the power corridors of
Delhi.

Dear countrymen, times have changed. Some people sitting in their
drawing rooms used to claim that they will change the policies of the
government, or influence in them in a negative way have been silenced.
Our doors are closed to them.

Dear countrymen, we have rooted out nepotism and affiliations. We have
strongly condemned favoritism and bias. Strong action is being taken
against corrupt officers. More than three lakh dubious companies have
been closed down, and restrictions have been imposed on their directors.
Today, we have introduced IT interventions for online transactions to
ensure transparency. There was a time when seeking an environmental
clearance meant facing rampant corruption. We have made the process
transparent and online. Any person can access it. We can work in a way
that the nation’s resources are utilized judiciously. It is also a matter of
immense pride for women of the country that today we have three women
judges in the Supreme Court providing justice to the nation. This is the first
time after independence that the Union Cabinet has the maximum
representation of women ministers.

Dear Countrymen, today I wish to share some wonderful news with my
brave daughters. On this occasion, I declare with pride the grant of
Permanent Commission for the appointment of women officers in Short
Service Commission of Indian Armed Forces. The process will be
transparent and similar to the selection process of male officers. This is a
gift from my side from the ramparts of the Red Fort, to the daughters who
are in uniformed services and have dedicated their lives to the nation. The
nation salutes the patriotic fervor and national commitment displayed by
young girls who are our national pride. Women are equally contributing in
building a strong India. The nation is experiencing the pride, contribution
and potential of our mothers and sisters.

From agricultural fields to the sports arena, our women are holding the
Indian Tricolor high. From Sarpanch to the Parliament, our women are
contributing to the development of the country. From schools to armed
forces everywhere the women of our country are marching ahead. But
while our women are valiantly moving ahead in such large numbers, we
also come across gruesome ugliness. We sometimes see demonic forces
posing challenges to women’s power. Rape is painful, and we, the
countrymen, the people should feel many times more pain than the pain
borne by the victim. Brothers and sisters, we have to free this society from
this demonic mentality. The law is taking its own course. Recently, rapists
in a case from Katni in Madhya Pradesh were sentenced to death after just
five days of trial. Similarly, in Rajasthan, rapists were sentenced to death
after a few days of trial. More such news gets published, the more such
people with demonic mentality will get scared. We have to publicize such
news. People should know that rapists are being sent to the gallows. There
is a need to beat this mentality; there is a need to curb this thinking, and
there is a need to stop this aberration. Brothers and sisters, this mentality
breeds unpardonable crimes. Rule of law is supreme for us and there
cannot be any compromise on that. Nobody can be allowed to take law into
their own hands. In the family, in schools, colleges, our children of the new
generation, our small innocent children should be nurtured in such an
environment that they learn appropriate values. They should learn to
respect women. They should know that this is the right way to live. We
have to instill this feeling and values in our families.
Brothers and sisters, I want to reassure my Muslim sisters. Triple Talaq has
spoiled the lives of Muslim daughters of our country. Those who have not
faced the Talaq are spending their lives under pressure. We wanted to
bring a legislation in this session of Parliament itself to free Muslim women
from this evil system. But there are some people who are obstructing the
passage of this Bill. But I want to assure my Muslim mothers, sisters and
daughters that I will not stop till they get justice. I will fulfill your aspirations.

My beloved countrymen, our army, paramilitary forces, police, intelligence
agencies are the source of strength for our country’s internal security. They
have created a sense of security in us. They have ensured a peaceful
environment. A new confidence has been generated because of their
sacrifices, dedication and hard work.

Brothers and Sisters, we used to hear about incidents of violence every
now and then from the North East, there were reports of insurgency. We
used to hear about the incidents of bomb blasts and firing. But today the
two states of Meghalaya and Tripura have seen withdrawal of the Armed
Forces Special Power Act (AFSPA) which was in force for three or four
decades. This was possible because of efforts of our security forces,
because of actions taken by the state Governments, because of
development projects executed by the Centre and the state Governments
and the efforts to connect people there with the national mainstream.
Tripura and Meghalaya are now out of the purview of the Armed Forces
Special Power Act. Several districts of Arunachal Pradesh have also been
brought out of the purview of the Armed Forces Special Power Act. Now, it
is in force only in a few districts.

Left Wing Extremism, Maoism have been bleeding the country. Violent
incidents, people fleeing from homes and hiding in forests were a matter of
daily occurrence. However, today because of continuous efforts by our
security forces, launching of development projects and efforts to connect
the people with national mainstream, left-wing extremism which affected
126 districts has now been reduced to 90 districts. The work on finding a
solution to put an end to left wing extremism from those districts is
progressing rapidly.

Brothers and Sisters, regarding Jammu & Kashmir, the path shown by Atal
Bihari Vajpayeeji is the right one. We want to move ahead on that road.
Vajpayeeji said Insaniyat, Jamhuriyat, Kashmiriyat (humanism, democracy,
Kasmiriyat)–with these three basic elements we want to develop Jammu &
Kashmir. Whether it is Ladakh or Jammu or Srinagar valley. We want
balanced development where an ordinary person’s aspirations are fulfilled,
infrastructure is strengthened; we want to move ahead with brotherhood in
our hearts. We do not want to move on the road of bullets and abuses, we
want to move ahead with love and affection with the Kashmiri people who
have stood with us in patriotic fervor.

Brothers and Sisters, irrigation schemes are progressing. The work of
building IIT, IIM and AIIMS is speedily going on. The work of reclamation
of Dal Lake is also going on. The biggest thing is that during the past one
year village headmen from Jammu and Kashmir in large numbers have
been meeting me with the request to hold Panchayat elections there. The
elections could not be held for some reason or the other. I am happy that
the villagers of Jammu and Kashmir will have this opportunity in the coming
months. A system in which villagers will be able to look after their villages
will be in place soon. Now, the Government of India gives huge funds
which go directly to the villages and this will help the village headmen to
take their villages on the path of development. That is why we are moving
forward in the direction of holding Panchayat elections and election to City
Councils.

Brothers and Sisters, we have to take the country to new heights. Our
motto is “Sab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikaas’. There is no discrimination based
on yours or mine and no nepotism. And that is why we are going ahead
with this aim and today standing under this tricolour, once again I want to
reiterate the resolve for which we are ready to sacrifice ourselves.

Let every Indian have a house of his own - Housing for All. Every house
should have electricity connection, power for all. Every Indian should be
free from smoke in kitchen and that is why there is the scheme for Cooking
Gas for All. Every Indian should have enough water to meet his needs and
that is why there is the scheme for Water for All. Every Indian should have
toilets and therefore Sanitation for All. Every Indian should be skilled, so
Skill for All. Every Indian should get good and affordable health services, so
Health for All. Every Indian should feel safe, every Indian should be
insured, hence ‘Insurance for All’. Every Indian should get internet services
so, Connectivity for All; we want to take the country forward by following
this mantra.

My dear brothers and sisters, people tell many things about me too and
whatever may be said, I would like to publicly admit certain things today. I
am impatient as several countries have gone ahead of us, I am restless
and impatient to take my country ahead of all these countries.

My dear countrymen, I am worked up and I am restless because
malnutrition has been a major hurdle in the development of the children of
our country. It remains a huge bottleneck. I am restless to rid my country of
malnutrition.

My countrymen, I am agitated so that a poor person can get an appropriate
health cover. I am restless so that an ordinary citizen of my country can
combat diseases and remain healthy.

Brothers and sisters, I am restless, I am restless to ensure that our citizens
can have a quality life, so that they can have the opportunity to live with
ease and so that there may be an all-round improvement.
My dear countrymen, I am restless, I am agitated and I am also impatient
for my country to lead the fourth industrial revolution, the revolution that is
based on knowledge, the revolution which will be led by those who have IT
skills. I am impatient for my country to lead it.

My dear countrymen, I am restless because I want that my country should
take maximum advantage of its capabilities and resources and we can
move forward in the world with a sense of pride.

My dear countrymen, we want to move ahead. We cannot accept
stagnation, we cannot be standstill and it is not in our nature to bend before
anybody. This country will neither come to a standstill, neither will it bend
and nor will it get tired. We have to achieve greater heights, we have to
keep moving ahead.

Brothers and sisters, we are the inheritors of the rich heritage of our ancient
legacy of Vedas. And that legacy is due to our self-confidence, and we
want to carry forward the legacy.

My dear countrymen, we don’t want to only dream about the future, but
aspire to scale new heights in the future. We want to move forward with the
dream of being at the top. And that is why my dear countrymen, I want to
instill a new hope, a new zeal and a new belief (in you) because the
country can achieve its dreams with it. And that is why my dear
countrymen…

My dear brothers and sisters,

Once again on the sacred occasion of independence, I offer my best
wishes. Come, let’s say aloud the Mantra of ‘Jai Hind’!
Jai Hind! Jai Hind! Jai Hind!

Bharat Mata ki Jai!

Bharat Mata ki Jai!

Bharat Mata ki Jai!

Vande Mataram! Vande Mataram! Vande Mataram!"
2017,Narendra Modi,BJP,NA,"English rendering of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s Address to the Nation from the ramparts of the Red Fort on the 71st Independence Day- August, 15, 2017",Press Information Bureau,https://pib.gov.in/,"My dear fellow citizens,

Greetings from the ramparts of the Red Fort on the auspicious occasion of
Independence Day.

Nation is celebrating the Independence Day with the festival of
Janamashtmi today. I can see a number of Bal Kanahiyas here. We are
fortunate to have in our cultural and historical heritage from a Sudarshan
Chakradhari Mohan to Charkhadhari Mohan.

From the ramparts of Red Fort, on behalf of our 125 crore countrymen, I
bow and pay respects to all those men and women who have sacrificed
their lives, who have undergone immense sufferings and made sacrifices
for the independence, glory and pride of the country.

Sometimes, natural calamities are a big challenge for us. A good monsoon
contributes immensely to the prosperity of the country. However, due to
climate change, sometimes it turns into a natural calamity. Several parts of
the country faced natural calamities recently. Besides our innocent children
lost their lives in a hospital. Our 125 crore countrymen stand shoulder to
shoulder with them in this hour of crisis and grief. I assure the countrymen
that in this hour of crisis we shall leave no stone unturned to ensure the
wellbeing of all.

My dear countrymen, this year is a special year for independent India. We
commemorated 75 years of Quit India Movement last week. This year we
are also commemorating the centenary of Champaran Satyagrah and the
Sabarmati Ashram. The centenary of Lokmanya Tilak’s call “Swaraj is my
birth right” falls this year as well. The year marks the 125th Anniversary of
the Ganesh Utsav which led to the rise of community awakening through
the celebrations. It inspires us to dedicate ourselves to a cause for the
country. A collective resolve of the citizens was visible during 1942 to 1947
across the country which forced the British to Quit India within a span of
five years. We will have to exhibit the same resolve from now on in the
70th year of independence to 2022, the 75th year of independence.

We now have five years before we reach the 75th year of our
independence. Our united resolve, strength and determination to work hard
remembering the memory of our great patriots will help us to build an India
of their dreams by 2022. Therefore, we have to take the country forward
with a pledge to build a New India.

We are aware of the power of the collective resolve, hard work, sacrifice
and devotion of our 125 crore citizens. Lord Krishna was immensely
powerful, but it is only when the milkmen came out with sticks in his support
that they could lift the Govardhan parvat. When Lord Rama had to go to
Lanka, the monkeys of vanar sena came to his help, Ramsetu was built
and Lord Rama could reach Lanka. Then there was Mohandas
Karamchand Gandhi, who empowered his countrymen to weave the fabric
of independence with cotton and spinning wheel.

The collective resolve and strength of the people got freedom for our
country. No one is small or big. We have in our memory the story of squirrel
which became an agent of change. That’s why we must remember that no
one among the 125 crore people is either small or big – everyone is equal.
If each one of us, irrespective of where he belongs to, strives with a new
resolve, a new energy, a new strength, we can change the face of the
country with our combined strength in the 75th year of our independence in
2022. It will be the New India – a secure, prosperous and strong nation. A
New India where there is equal opportunity for all; where modern science
and technology play an important role in bringing glory for the nation in the
global arena.

Our freedom movement is linked to our sentiments. We know it well that at
the time of the freedom movement, the teacher who was engaged in
teaching, the farmer who was tilling his land, the laborer who was working –
all of them knew in their hearts that whatever they were doing, was
contributing towards the independence of the country. This idea is a great
source of strength. In the family, food is prepared everyday but it becomes
‘prasad’ only when it is offered to the deity.

We are working, but if we do so in the spirit of working for the glory of
mother India, for the divinity of mother India, if we do it to rid our
countrymen of poverty, if we do it to properly weave our social fabric, if we
discharge our duties with feelings towards the country, if we do it with a
sense of devotion to country, if we do our work by dedicating it to the
country, then the achievements will be much more. That is why we should
move forward with this spirit.

January 1, 2018 will not be an ordinary day – those born in this century will
start turning 18. For these people, this is a decisive year of their lives. They
are going to be the creator of the destiny (Bhagya Vidhata) of our nation in
the 21​st​ century. I heartily welcome all these youth, honour them and offer
my respects to them. You have an opportunity to shape the destiny of our
country. A proud nation invites you to become a part of its developmental
journey.

My dear countrymen,

When Arjuna was posing a lot of queries to Lord Krishna in the battlefield of
Kurukshetra, then Krishna told Arjuna that you achieve goals as per your
thinking and beliefs. We have a strong determination, we are committed for
a brighter India. We, who have grown up with a state of hopelessness,
have to reject the feeling of despair and must now march ahead with
confidence.

We have to leave this 'Chalta Hai' attitude. We have to think of 'Badal Sakta
Hai'- this attitude will help us as a nation. We should have this confidence
that with sacrifice and hard work and a resolve to do something, we will get
necessary resources and the ability to do it and then a big transformation
will happen, and our resolve will convert into accomplishment.

Brothers and sisters,

It is natural for our countrymen to think of our safety and security. Our
country, our military, our brave-hearts, our uniformed forces, be it any
force, not just the army, air force or navy, all the uniformed forces,
whenever they were called upon to do so, they showed their valour, their
strength; our brave-hearts never turned their back in making the supreme
sacrifice. Be it Left-Wing-Extremism, be it terrorism, be it infiltrators, be it
the elements fomenting trouble inside our country- the uniformed forces of
our country have made extreme sacrifices. And when the surgical strike
was carried out, then the world had to acknowledge India’s capability and
strength.

My dear countrymen,

India's security is our priority. Be it our coast line or our borders, the space
or the cyberspace, India is capable of ensuring its own security and strong
enough to ward off any threats against the country.

My beloved countrymen,

Those who have looted the nation and looted the poor are not able to sleep
peacefully today. Due to this, the confidence of the hardworking and honest
person is increasing. An honest man now feels that his honesty matters.
Today, we are celebrating a festival of honesty and there is no place for
dishonesty. This gives us new hope.

The law against Benami property was lying in limbo for years. Now, we
have come up with a law against Benami Property. In such a short time, the
government has unearthed Benami properties worth over Rs.800 crores.
When these things happen, the common man develops faith that the
country is for the honest persons.

The 'One Rank - One Pension' policy for our defence forces was stuck up
for 30-40 years. Our government implemented it. When we fulfill the
aspirations of our soldiers, then their morale goes high and their resolve to
protect the nation grows manifold.

The country has many states and a Central Government. GST has shown
the spirit of cooperative federalism and has given competitive cooperative
federalism a new strength. The success of GST can be attributed to the
hard work that has been put in to make it a success. Technology has made
it look like a miracle. The global community is surprised how we were able
to roll out GST in such a short time. It is a reflection of our capability and
helps in building the confidence and faith of the future generations.

New systems are emerging. Today roads are being built at twice the speed.
The railway tracks are being laid at double the speed. More than 14
thousand villages that were hitherto shrouded in darkness even after
Independence, have been provided with electricity. Bank accounts of 29
crore people have been opened, more than 9 crore farmers have got Soil
Health Card. More than 2 crore poor mothers and sisters are no longer
using the fuel wood and using LPG gas stove NOW. The poor tribals have
gained faith in the system. The person at the last mile of development now
joins the mainstream and the nation is marching ahead.

More than 8 crore loans have been sanctioned without guarantee to the
youth for self-employment. The interest on bank loans have been lowered.
Inflation is under control. If a person belonging to the middle-class wants to
build his house, then he gets a loan at a lower rate of interest. In this way,
the country is moving forward and people are joining the movement.
The times have changed. The government is determined to do all it says,
like doing away with the interview process.

In the labour sector alone, even a small businessman had to fill up to 50-60
forms, but we have now made it more convenient by reducing it to just 5-6
forms. I can provide many such instances of Good Governance, simplifying
the process of Governance. By reiterating this we have enforced faster
decision making. And that is why 125 crore countrymen have been able to
repose faith in our governance.

Dear Countrymen,

India today has gained in stature across the globe. You will be happy to
know that we are not alone in our fight against terrorism. Many nations are
proactively supporting us.

Be it Hawala, or any inputs related to terrorism, the global community is
supporting us with critical information. We have joined hands with other
nations in the combined fight against terrorism. I extend my heartfelt
greetings to all those countries who are standing in solidarity with us and
acknowledge our prowess.

For the development and progress of Jammu & Kashmir, its prosperity, and
fulfilment of the aspirations of the citizens, not only the J&K government,
but we as responsible citizens also have a responsibility. We are committed
to restore the state to its former glory so as to experience the paradise that
it was, once again.

On Kashmir there is rhetoric and politics. But I am clear in my belief on how
to win the war against separatism, which is spread by a handful of people.
The problem will be solved neither by abuse or bullets - it will be solved by
embracing all Kashmiris. Such is the legacy of 125 crore Indians. Hence,
neither by abuse nor by bullets, change will come by embracing all. And we
are moving forward with this resolve.

We shall take strict steps against terrorism. There is no question of being
soft on terrorism or terrorists. We have been asking the extremists to join
the mainstream. Democracy provides an equal opportunity and rights to be
heard for all. The process of engagement can take place only by their
joining the mainstream.

I deeply appreciate the efforts of security forces in curbing the Left Wing
extremism which mobilized a lot of youth from these regions to surrender
and joined the mainstream.

Security forces are keeping a tight vigil on our borders. I am delighted to
announce that today the Indian Government is launching a website which
will give an account of the valour of the Gallantry Award winners. A portal
is also being launched which aims to provide the entire details of these
brave hearts who have brought pride to the nation. The story of sacrifices
made will certainly inspire the younger generations.

With the help of technology, we are trying to promote honesty and
transparency in the country. Our fight against black money will continue;
our fight against corruption will continue. With the intervention of
technology, slowly we are trying to link Aadhaar with the system. We have
been successful in infusing transparency in the system. People from
around the world have appreciated this model and have been studying it.

A common man living thousands of kilometres away can now supply his
products to the Government. He doesn’t need any middle man. We have
launched a portal called “GEM”. The Government is making procurement
through this portal. We have been successful in bringing transparency at
various levels.
Brothers and Sisters,

Implementation of Government schemes are gaining momentum. When a
work is delayed, it is not only the project that is delayed. It is not a matter of
expenditure of money. When a work is stalled, the poor families are the
ones who suffer the most.

We can reach the planet Mars within 9 months; we are capable of
achieving that.

I review Government Projects every month. A specific project came to my
notice. It was a 42-year old project. 70-72 kilometres of Railway lines were
to be laid, but the project was lying in limbo for the last 42 years.

My brothers and sisters,

When a country that is capable of reaching Mars within 9 months, how is it
possible that it is not able to lay 70-72 Kilometres railway lines for 42 long
years. It sets in doubts in the minds of the poor. We have taken care of all
these things. We have been striving to bring in the changes through
technology. Whether it is Geo-Technology or Space-Technology, we have
tried to link all these technologies to bring in transformation.

You must have seen that there was a time when tension prevailed between
the Centre and the States for Urea and Kerosene. The Centre was like an
elder brother while the State was treated like a younger brother. I have
been a Chief Minister for a long time and I know the importance of states in
the development of the country. I know the importance of the Chief
Ministers and the State Governments. Hence , we laid emphasis on
Co-operative Federalism. Now we are moving towards a Competitive
Co-operative Federalism. You must have seen that we are taking all the
decisions together.
You may recall that one of our Prime Ministers in his address from the
ramparts of Red Fort had talked about the poor state of affairs of the power
supply companies of the country. He expressed his concerns over the
issue. Today with the “UDAY” Yojana, we have worked together to resolve
the issues with these power companies. It is a concrete example of
federalism in its real sense.

Whether it is GST or Smart City Project, whether it is Swachh Bharat
Abhiyan, or construction of toilets, or ease of doing business, all these are
being accomplished by working together shoulder to shoulder with the
States.

My dear fellow countrymen,

In the New India, the biggest strength is democracy. But we have reduced
our democracy to mere ballot boxes. However, democracy cannot be
confined only to ballot boxes. Hence our resolve is to see to it that we have
a democracy in New India, where people are not driven by the system,
rather the system is driven by the people. Such a democracy should
become the identity of New India and we want to move towards that
direction.

Lokmanya Tilak Ji had said “Swaraj is my birthright”. In Independent India
our Mantra should be “Good Governance is my birthright”. ‘Suraja’ or Good
Governance should be our collective responsibility. The citizens should
fulfil their duties and the Government too should discharge its
responsibilities.

When we move from “Swaraj” to “Suraja”, the citizens do not lag behind.
For example, when I called upon the countrymen to give up gas subsidy,
the nation responded as a whole. I have spoken about cleanliness. Now
people are joining hands from every part of the country to take up this
cleanliness drive forward.

When demonetization was announced, the world was surprised. People
thought that this was the end of Modi. But the way our 125 crore
countrymen had shown patience and faith, we were able to take one after
another step in our drive against corruption.

With this new practice of people’s participation, our effort to take the
country forward with people’s involvement will help us to reach our goal.

My dear fellow countrymen,

Lal Bahadur Shastri had given the slogan “Jai Jawan Jai Kisan.” Our
farmers have not looked back since then. They are now producing record
harvests and scaling new heights despite facing natural adversities. There
has been a record production of pulses this year.

My dear brothers and sisters,

India never had the tradition to import pulses and if it had to import on rare
occasions, it was only a few thousand tons. This year when they produced
16 lakh tons of pulses to provide nutrition to the poor, the government took
the historic step of encouraging them by buying their produce.

Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojna has provided a security cover to our
farmers. Three years back, this scheme which was running under a
different name earlier, covered only 3.25 crore farmers. Now over a short
span of three years more farmers have been brought under its ambit. The
number is soon going to touch the 5.75 crore mark.

Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojna aims to meet the demand of water of
the farmers. If my farmers get water, they can produce rich harvests from
their fields. That is why I had made some announcements from the
ramparts of Red Fort on the last Independence Day. Out of those, we have
completed 21 projects and remaining 50 would be completed soon. I have
resolved to complete 99 big projects. By completing those 99 big projects
before 2019, we shall fulfill our commitment. We cannot change the lot of
our farmers until we hand hold him from procuring seeds to ensure that his
produce reaches the market. For this we need infrastructure and supply
chain. Every year vegetables, fruits and grains worth lakhs of crores of
rupees are wasted. In order to change the situation, the government has
encouraged Foreign Direct Investment in food processing sector.

Government of India has launched ‘Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojna’
to encourage infrastructure building. Due to this, systems shall be put in
place that will ensure hand-holding of the farmers from supplying seeds to
marketing his produce. Such arrangements will usher in a new change in
the lives of crores of our farmers.

With the changes in demand and technology, the nature of jobs in our
country has been changing. The Government has launched several new
initiatives in the employment related schemes and also in the manner in
which the training is imparted for the development of human resource
according to the needs of the 21​st​ century. We have launched a massive
program to provide collateral free loans to the youth. Our youth should
become independent, he should get the employment, he should become
the provider of employment. Over the past three years, ‘Pradhanmantri
Mudra Yojana’ has led to millions and millions of youth becoming
self-dependent. It’s not just that, one youth is providing employment to one,
two or three more people.

In the education sector, we have taken an important step to grant the
universities freedom from restrictions to make them the world class
universities. We have asked 20 universities to decide their own destiny.
The government will not interfere in their functioning. Besides, the
government is willing to provide funds up to Rs. 1,000 crores. We have
appealed to them and I am confident that the education institutions of our
country will certainly come forward and make it a success.

Over the last three years, we have set up 6 IITs, 7 new IIMs and 8 new
IIITs and we have also done the groundwork for linking the education with
job opportunities.

My mothers and sisters, the women in the families seek employment in
large numbers. And therefore we have taken a very important step to
reform the labour laws to provide them the employment opportunities in the
night also.

Our mothers and sisters are an integral unit of our families. Their
contribution in making our future is extremely important. And that is why we
have decided to increase the paid maternity leave to 26 weeks from the
earlier 12 weeks.

In the context of women empowerment, I’d like to honour those sisters who
have been forced to lead a very difficult life due to ‘Triple Talaq’. There is
no recourse for them, and such victims of ‘Triple Talaq’ have launched a
massive movement in the country. They shook the conscience of the
intellectual class of the country, the media of the country also helped them
and a movement against ‘Triple Talaq’ was started in the country. I heartily
commend those sisters who have launched this movement, who have been
fighting against the ‘Triple Talaq’ and I’m confident that the country will help
them in this struggle. The country will help these mothers and sisters in
securing this right. India will fully support them and they will ultimately
achieve success in this very important step in the direction of women
empowerment; I am fully confident about this.

My dear countrymen,
Sometimes in the name of faith, some people due to lack of patience end
up destroying the social fabric. The country is governed by peace, harmony
and unity. The poison of casteism and communalism can never benefit the
country. This is the land of Gandhi and Buddha, we have to move forward
taking everyone along. This is a part of our country’s culture and tradition.
We have to successfully carry it forward, and that is why in the name of
faith, violence cannot be allowed.

If something happens to a patient in a hospital and the hospital is burnt
down; some accident happens and the vehicles are burnt down; people
launch a movement and the public property is burnt down; is it for a free
India? It is the property of 125 crore Indians. Whose cultural legacy is this?
This is our cultural legacy, the legacy of 125 crore people. Whose faith is
this? This is our faith, the faith of 125 crore people; and that is why the path
of violence in the name of faith can never succeed in this country. The
country will never accept this. And that is why I’d like to appeal to all the
countrymen that at that time our motto was ‘Bharat Chodo’ and today’s
slogan is ‘Bharat Jodo’. We have to take everyone and every section of the
society along to take the country forward.

In order to build a prosperous India, we need a strong economy, balanced
development and next generation infrastructure. Only then, we can realise
the India of our dreams.

Brothers and sisters,

We have taken innumerable decisions over the past three years. Some
have been noticed, while the rest may not have been noticed. But one thing
is important - when you move towards big changes, you will face hurdles.
But look at the working style of this government; when a train crosses a
railway station and changes the track, the speed needs to be reduced from
60 to 30. The speed of the train decreases while changing the track. We
are trying to put the whole country on a new track without decreasing the
speed. We have maintained the speed.

We may have brought a number of new laws and systems such as the
GST, but we have successfully accomplished the task and the work goes
on.

We have laid emphasis on infrastructure. We have invested lot of funds for
building the infrastructure – from modernization of the railway station in a
small town, to build an Airport, to expand water-ways or roadways, to form
a gas-grid or a water-grid or to lay down an optical fibre network. We are
emphasising on all types of modern infrastructure.

My dear countrymen,

The prosperity of Eastern India is required for India’s forward movement
into the 21st century. It has tremendous potential, rich human resources,
immense natural wealth, work force and it has the power to change lives.
We are devoting significant attention to eastern India- Bihar, Assam, West
Bengal, Odisha, and the Northeast. These parts have to grow further.
These are abundant in natural resources and are striving hard to take the
country to new heights.

Brothers and sisters,

Making India corruption-free is an important task and we are trying to
provide impetus to it. After forming the government, our first task was to
constitute an SIT. Today, after three years, I want to tell the countrymen
proudly that we have unearthed black money worth Rs. 1.25 lakh crores,
the culprits would be brought to book and forced to surrender.

Demonetization followed this move. We have achieved several milestones
through demonetization. The hidden black money has been brought into
the formal economy. You must have seen that we used to extend the days
from 7 days to 10 days to 15 days; sometimes we allowed the old notes at
the petrol pump, at the chemist shops, and sometimes at the railway
stations, because our intention was to bring all money into the formal
banking system and we achieved success in completing the task.
According to the research conducted by outside experts, about Rs.3 lakh
crores that had never come into the banking system before, has been
brought into the system after the demonetization.

More than Rs. 1.75 lakh crores deposited in the banks is under the
scanner. Black money worth Rs. 2 lakh crore had to be deposited in the
banks and this system has forced them to be accountable. It has also
stopped the flow of black money. The number of new taxpayers filing
income tax returns from April 01 to August 05 is 56 lakhs while in the same
period last year only 22 lakh filed the returns.. In a way it has more than
doubled. This is the result of our fight against black money.

Over 18 lakh people have been identified, whose income is much higher
than what their declared income and therefore they have to clarify this.
Around 4.5 lakh people have now come forward and are trying to trade the
right path after accepting their mistakes. One lakh people, who had neither
heard of Income Tax nor paid Income Tax, have now been forced to do so.

Brothers and sisters,

In our country, we tend to indulge in endless debates and discussions
following the shutdown of companies. People start speculating about
economic meltdown and what not.

You will be surprised to know that black marketers used to own shell
companies. Post demonetization, the reports from data mining
astonishingly revealed that there are 3 lakh shell companies dealing in
Hawala transactions. Can anyone imagine? Out of these 3 lakh shell
companies, registration of 1.75 lakh companies were cancelled.

Even if five companies shut shop in India, there is huge public outcry. And
here, we have closed one lakh Seventy five thousand companies. The
looters of nation’s wealth will have to answer. We have accomplished this
task.

You will be surprised to know that there are some shell companies
operating from a single address. As many as 400 companies have been
found to be operating from one address. There was no one to question
them. There was a total collusion.

Therefore, Brothers and sisters, I have waged a big war against corruption
and black money. We are fighting corruption - for the bright future of India
and the wellbeing of our people.

Brothers and sisters,

We have taken several steps and I am sure that post GST, it will increase
further and bring in transparency. Today a truck driver on an average is
able to save 30% of his travel time from one point to another after GST was
introduced. Hundreds of crores of rupees have been saved due to removal
of check posts. This amounts to 30% increase in his efficiency. Can you
imagine what it means to accomplish 30% more efficiency in the Indian
transportation sector? GST has brought this revolutionary change.

My dear countrymen,

Today due to demonetization, banks have enough liquidity. Banks are
reducing their interest rates. Even a common man is able to access inflow
of funds through Mudra. He is getting opportunities to stand on his feet.
The middle class and the underprivileged who aspire to have their own
homes someday, are getting loans from the banks at low interest rates.
Such moves are giving a fillip to the economic growth of the country.

My dear countrymen,

Time has changed. We are in the 21st Century. Our country boasts of the
world’s largest youth population.

India is known in the world for its prowess in IT and Digital World. Should
we still remain in the old mind-set? There was a time when leather coins
were in vogue, but gradually they ceased to exist. Today we have
paper-currency. Slowly this paper-currency will be replaced by the digital
currency. We should lead from the front to make a move towards Digital
transactions. We should adopt BHIM App for transactions and make it a
part of our economic activities. We should also work through prepaid
systems. I am happy that there has been an increase in Digital
transactions. It has increased by 34% compared to last year while the
prepaid transactions have gone up by 44%. We should move towards a
less-cash economy.

My Dear Countrymen, some schemes of the Government are meant for
ensuring savings for the common man. If you use LED bulbs, you can save
Rs.2000 to Rs. 5000 per year. If we succeed in Swachh Bharat, poor will
be able to save Rs. 7000 on medicines that they would otherwise have
spent. Curbing inflation has helped people in saving money in a way.

Cheap medicines through Jan Aushadhi Kendras are a boon to the poor.
There used to be a lot of expenditure on operations and stents. We are
striving to make it possible for knee operations as well. We are striving to
minimize this expenditure for the poor and the middle class.

Earlier there used to be Dialysis only at the State capitals. Now we have
decided to open Dialysis Centres at district level. We have already opened
this facility in 350 to 400 districts where free Dialysis services are available
for the poor.

We can take pride in the fact that we have developed various systems to
showcase to the world. We have been able to develop the ‘NAVIC
Navigation System’ through GPS. We have helped the neighbouring
countries by successfully launching SAARC Satellite.

We asserted our supremacy in the world by introducing Tejas aircraft.
BHIM Aadhaar App for digital transaction has come as a surprise to the
world. Crores of RuPay Cards are now available in the country. When all
the cards will be operational, it will be the largest number of cards in the
world.

My dear countrymen, I shall urge you to take up the New India Pledge and
move ahead. Our scriptures say, “अ नयत काल:, अ नयत कालः भु यो
 वपलव ते, भु यो वपलव ते”. It implies that, if we don’t accomplish a work
within the stipulated time then we shall not be able to get the desired
results. So for the ‘Team India’, for the 125 crore countrymen, we have to
take the pledge to achieve the goal by 2022.

We will do it with dedication to see a great, majestic India by 2022.
So we will together build such an India where the poor will have Pucca
House with electricity and water.

Together we will build such an India where the farmers can sleep without
worry. They will earn double by 2022 of what they are earning today.
Together we will build such an India where the youth, the women will have
enough opportunities to fulfil their dreams.

Together we will build such an India which will be free from terrorism,
communalism and casteism.
Together we will build such an India where nobody will compromise with
corruption and nepotism.

Together we will build such an India which will be clean and healthy, and
where the dream of Su-Raj will be fulfilled.

And that is why my dear fellow countrymen, we will together strive to move
ahead in this march towards development.

Let all of us march together with the dream of a building an India of
grandeur and majesty as we wait for the 75th year of independence after
completing 70 years of Independence in the next five years.

With this thought in mind I once again bow my head before the heroes of
our freedom movement. I bow my head before the new confidence and
passion of my 125 crore countrymen and I call upon Team India to march
on with this new pledge.

With this thought I convey my hearty congratulations to all of you.

Bharat Mata Ki Jai, Vande Matram, Jai Hind

Jai Hind, Jai Hind, Jai Hind, Jai Hind

Bharat Mata Ki Jai, Bharat Mata Ki Jai, Bharat Mata Ki Jai,

Vande Matram, Vande Matram, Vande Matram, Vande Matram,

Thanking you all."
2016,Narendra Modi,BJP,NA,Text of the english rendering of PM Shri Narendra Modi’s address to the Nation from the ramparts of the Red Fort on the 70th Independence Day,Press Information Bureau,https://pib.gov.in/,"My beloved countrymen, on this auspicious occasion of our festival of
freedom; I extend lots of greetings to the one hundred and twenty five
crores fellow nationals and also to entire Indian diaspora spread all over
the world, from this rampart of the Red Fort. This festival of our freedom,
this 70 years of our Independence, is the festival for our resolution to take
the nation to new heights with a new resolve and a new fervour and new
energy. We are able to breathe in a free air as the result of the sacrifices,
renunciation and penance of our millions of great forefathers. We are also
reminded of the youths who kissed the gallows. We also remember
Mahatma Gandhi, Sardar Patel, Pandit Nehru and countless great persons,
who fought ceaselessly for the freedom of our nation. It is the result of their
struggles that we are now fortunate enough to breathe as a free citizen.
India is a very ancient nation. We have a history of thousands of years and
our cultural heritage is also millennia old. Right from the Vedas to
Vivekananda, from the Upanishads to the satellites, the Sudarshan
Chakradhari Mohan to Charkhadhari Mohan, from the Bhim of Mahabharat
to the Bhimrao; we have a long historical journey and heritage. Our land
has seen many historical ups and downs and our generations have waged
many struggles and observed penance to bequeath great values to the
humanity. India's age is not just seventy years. But having won freedom
after a period of subjugation; we have made efforts to take the nation
forward in this journey of seventy years. Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel united
the nation. Now, it is the responsibility of all of us to make this nation better.
We all have to work ceaselessly for the realization of the dream of ' One
India, great India'. (Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat).

Brothers and Sisters, We have not attained freedom for free of cost.
Innumerable were the atrocities, but undeterred were our resolves also.
Every Indian was a soldier in the battle for freedom. Each one of them
dreamt of an independent India. May be every one of them was not
fortunate enough to sacrifice, may be each of them was not fortunate
enough to go to prison; but every Indian had a resolve and the leadership
of Mahatma ji and also the inspiration of countless revolutionaries who had
sacrificed every thing. All these movements contributed to our attainment of
Independence. But, now we have to convert this freedom into 'the real
freedom'. Now, this is the resolve of the one hundred and twenty five crores
of Indians. So, just as we did not attain our freedom without sacrifices; we
would not be able to attain ' the real freedom' without renunciation, without
human endeavour (Purusharth), without bravery, without dedication and
discipline. So, in order to take ahead this resolution of one hundred and
twenty five crore Indians; all of us will have to move ahead with our specific
responsibilities in a most committed manner. Be it a Panchayat or the
Parliament, be it a village headman or the Prime minister; every one of us
as well as every democratic institution will have to shoulder their
responsibilities completely and perfectly. Only then we will be able to
realize the dream of our the real freedom as soon as possible.This is
correct to say that our nation is beset with many problems now- a- days.
But, we should never forget that if we have the problems, then we also
have all the capacities to solve them. So, if we move ahead with all our
capabilities, we will find the ways and mean to solve all these problems.
So, brothers and Sisters, if we have lakhs of problems, then we also have
one hundred and twenty five crore brains also which are all capable to
solve these problems.

Dear Brothers & Sisters, there was a time when Government used to be
surrounded by aspersions. But now time has changed. At present, no
aspersions are being leveled on the Government. Rather, people have
great expectations from it. When the Government is engulfed in
expectations then it signifies hope and trust, which in turn generates those
expectations. Expectations give pace towards good governance,
invigorates and so the pledges are implemented ad continuum. My
Brothers & Sisters, today when I am addressing you from the rampart of
the Red Fort, it is, therefore, but natural that we should discuss the journey
of good governance, the work done by the Government and work being
done and should be done for the country. I can present before you a very
detailed account of work done and also multiple issues regarding the
performance of the Government. During the tenure of two years, the
Government has taken innumerable initiatives and multiple tasks have
been done. If I start giving details about them, I am afraid I will have to talk
about it for a week from this very rampart of the Red Fort. So instead of
that temptation, I would like to draw your attention towards the work culture
of the Government. Sometimes, it is easier to present the account of work
done. But, it is not easy for a common man to comprehend, understand
and identify the work culture without dwelling deep into the work culture. My
Brothers & Sisters, My Countrymen, I would not talk solely about the policy,
but also the intention and decisions of the Government.

Dear Brothers & Sisters, it is just not an issue of direction and outline,
rather it is about holistic approach and a resolve for transformation. It is
confluence of trinity of expectation of people, democracy and support of
people. It is both wisdom and consent. It is also pace and realisation of
progress. Therefore, My Countrymen, when I talk about the Good
Governance, it does implies bringing in transformation in the life of common
man of my country. Good governance means that the government should
be sensitive, responsive and dedicated to the common man. Then only
good governance gets the emphasis. Responsibility and accountability
should be at the root of it and it should draw its vital energy from there only
for the government to be sensitive, dear Brothers and Sisters. We
remember the days when there used to be a very long wait to go to any big
hospital. People used to come to AIIMS, spend two three days and then
only it would be decided what diagnostic tests were to be done. Now we
have been able to change this system. Registration is done online and the
doctor’s appointment is also given online. The processes start on arrival of
the patient at the appointed hour itself. Not only this but all his medical
records are also available online. And we wish to develop it as a
countywide culture in the field of medical treatment. Today this system has
been put in place in 40 big hospitals of the country. Its basic premise is that
the government has to be sensitive.
Dear Brothers and Sisters, the government should be accountable. If it be
not so then the problems of the common man are kept pending for
solutions. How does the change come? Now technology is there, but there
was a time when the railway ticket in the railways, concerning the common
man and the poor was available only two thousand tickets per minute.
Those who might have seen it, would know how the buffering used to be
there, nobody knew when the website would be operational again, but
today I have to say with satisfaction that now it is possible to have fifteen
thousand tickets per minute.The government should be accountable, it
should take steps according to the necessities and expectations of the
people. There is a class across the country, particularly the middle class,
higher middle class whom you see troubled more at the hands of the
income tax officials rather than the police at times. I have to change the
situation and I am trying and I will certainly change it.

There was a time when a common and honest citizen used to give two
rupees extra as a measure of caution at the time of paying his income tax.
He used to think that he might not be harassed, but once the money was
deposited to the government exchequer, he had to run from pillar to post
and seek recommendations for getting the refund. It took months together
before the rightful money of the citizen was returned to him from the
government exchequer. Today, we have made a system of issuing online
refund. Today, refunds are given in one, two say or three weeks. Those
who are hearing me today on TV, they would also be realising that they had
not given any application, yet they had got refund directly into their account.
So, this responsibility and accountability are the results of these efforts.

It is equally important to lay emphasis on the transparency for good
governance. You know that a global relationship has already started to
become a common thing in the society today. A middle class man wants to
have his passport- there was a time when about 40 lakh, 50lakh
applications were received for getting passport. Today, approximately 2
crore people apply for the passport. Brothers and Sisters, earlier 4-6
months were taken for scrutiny of applications if one did not have
recommendations. We changed that situation and today, I can say with
pride that passports are issued to the citizens with all genuine details, in
about one or two weeks and there is transparency no recommendation is
required and there is no dilly-dallying. Today, I can say, we have issued
1.75 crores passports (in 2015-16 itself.)

In Surajya there must be efficiency in governance and therefore, earlier, if a
company had to set up a factory or desiring to do business in our country,
applications were submitted. There was a task of registration only, one
wanted to do something for the country, but almost 6 months passed in
normal course. Brothers and Sisters, if efficiency is brought, then the same
government, same rules, same officials have got geared up to perform the
same task of company registration within 24 hours and they are virtually
doing it. In the last July itself, they performed the task of more than 900
such registrations.

Brothers and Sisters, good governance is also necessary for Surajya and
the steps we have taken towards this good governance are that, as I had
said last year from the Red Fort that we would exempt group 'C' and group
'D' posts from interviews, they might get job on the basis of merit. We have
detected almost 9,000 posts for which thousands and lakhs of people need
to be recruited. Now, there would not be any interview process for these
9,000 posts, my young men would not need to spend any money for
interviews. Recommendations would not be needed, roads for corruption
and agents will be shut and this work has been implemented.

Brothers and Sisters, there was a time when a common man got satisfied if
the government announced any plan or merely announced that this would
be done, he used to think that something concrete would happen now.
Then, a time came when people asked for the plan unless the drawing of
the plan came. Then, there was a time when people asked for the budget.
Today, the mood of the country has changed in 70 years. It does not get
satisfied with the announcement, it is not satisfied by seeing the plan, if a
budget provision is made, it is not ready to accept this. It is accepted when
things get implemented on ground and we cannot bring things on ground
with the old pace. We have to speed up our work, increase the pace further
and then we can say that we have done something.

Rural roads are a perpetual issue in our country. Each rural citizen craves
for pakka roads. Its a huge task. Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ji took this task
specifically. Even succeding governments continued this and the work
continued. We have made efforts to fast track it. Earlier 70-75 Km of rural
roads were completed in a day. Now we have increased that pace up to
100KM a day. This pace will fulfil the aspirations of common man in the
days to come.

We have aid emphasis on energy, specifically renewable energy in our
country. That was a time, when after so many years of independence, we
started working on wind energy. Within a period of last one year we have
increased it up to 40%. So this is the scale of up acceleration. Whole world
is focussing on Solar energy. We have increased it approximately
116%-118%. This is not only a substantial incremental change, it’s a huge
leap forward. We intend to enhance the things in quantum way.

In our country, even before forming of our government, we had the power
production. But to reach the power, you need transmission lines and the
good transmission infrastructure. Two years preceding the formation of our
government, 30-35 thousand kilometres of transmission lines were being
laid annually. Today I wish to submit this with satisfaction that we have
raised this to 50,000 Kilometres. So we have increased the pace here. If
we take the commissioning of railway lines in previous 10 years, where
commissioning means capacity to ply the trains and to finish all the trials,
so earlier it was at the rate of 1500 kilometre in 10 years . But we have
made it up to 3500 kilometre in last 2 years. We are to increase this pace
even further.
Brothers and Sisters, Now we are connecting government schemes to
AAadhaar Card, focussing on stopping the leakages through direct benefit
transfer. Previous government had connected four crore people to
government schemes via Aadhaar Card. Today I can say this with
satisfaction that in place of that work of four crore, we have completed the
task of connecting 70 crore people to government schemes via Aadhaar
card. The remaining will also be taken into the fold.

Today, for middle class or for common people the ownership of a car is a
matter of pride. There was a time when gas stove at home was deemed as
a standard and as a symbol of social status. During the last 60 years of
independence, 14 crore LPG gas connections were given. Brothers and
Sisters, it is a great satisfaction to me that on one side, 14 crore gas
connections were given in 60 years, while on the other side, we have given
4 crore gas connections in just 60 weeks. Please compare the two figures -
14 crore in 60 years and 4 crore in 60 weeks. This is the speed, by which a
change has become possible in the quality of life of common men. We
have also started the task of eradicating obsolete laws. The burden of
unnecessary laws has been creating hindrance in the functioning of the
government, the judiciary and the public. We have identified 1700 such
laws, out of which 1175 laws have already been repealed by the Parliament
and several other such laws are in the process of repealing.

Brothers and Sisters, it had become a tendency among the people to say
that certain work can be done and certain other work cannot be done,
certain work cannot be done now and certain work cannot be done ever. A
kind of negativity was prevalent in the minds of people. Now, a clear break
through is visible in the mindset, a new synergy is seen in the functioning of
the government. When an accomplishment is achieved, it stimulates
dynamism, which sharpens our determination and then, the end result is
not far away.
Brothers and Sisters, when we had launched ""Prime Minister Jan-Dhan
Yojana"", it was almost an impossible task. There were banks and the
governments, nationalisation had already taken place, but the common
man of the country was not able to be a part of the mainstream of national
economy.

Brothers and Sisters, we have attained this impossible task through
inclusion of 21 crore persons under ""Jan-Dhan Yojana"". This is not a matter
of taking credit by the Government, it is really an achievement of 125 crore
countrymen of the country, for which I salute them. The campaign for
women pride in villages of the country is an important issue of today. The
practice of open defecation should be stopped; toilets should be built in
villages. When I had got the first opportunity to address from the ramparts
of the Red Fort, I had expressed my feelings about it. Now, I can claim that
more than 2 crore toilets have already been built in villages of the country
within such a short period. More than 70 thousand villages are now free
from the practice of open defecation. We are working towards bringing
change in the lives of common man.

I had earlier announced from the ramparts of the Red Fort that we would
electrify those 18 thousand villages, which are still without electricity.We
are going to complete 70 years of independence, but they had not seen
electricity. They were forced to live in the 18th century. We undertook this
task of making possible the impossible and today I am glad to say that,
though we have not been able to complete even half the task within a
thousand days, we are still away from the half-mark, out of the 18
thousand, electricity has reached ten thousand villages. I have been told
that there are many among those villages who are watching Independence
Day celebrations for the first time today on television in their homes. Today,
from here I extend special greetings to those villages.

Brothers and Sisters, you will be surprised to know that at merely three
hours journey from Delhi, there is a village called Nagla Fatela in Hathras
region. It takes only three hours to reach this Nagla Fatela. But it took 70
years for electricity to reach there. 70 years, my brothers and Sisters! And
therefore, I am introducing you to the work culture that we are following.

Brothers and Sisters, the LED bulbs were developed by the science and
the researchers for welfare of every citizen. But in India it used to cost 350
Rupees. Who would buy it? And even the government would think, “It’s
alright. The work is done. Someone must be using it.” But this should not
be the attitude. If LED bulbs can bring about a change in the life of a
common man, if it can ameliorate the environment, if it can improve India’s
economy, then the government must make efforts in this direction. It is the
nature of the government that it intervenes where it is not required and
shies away from intervening where it is needed. We tried to change this
situation, this work culture. And therefore, the bulb which used to be sold at
350 Rupees, it is now being sold at 50 Rupees because of governmental
intervention. See the difference! 350 Rupees on one hand and 50 Rupees
on the other. I do not want to ask where all this money used to go,
however, thirteen crore bulbs have been distributed till date.

The politics of our country has become populist; the economic policies
have become populist. If three hundred Rupees subsidy for each bulb had
been given from public exchequer, the Prime Minister would have been
applauded for doling out five hundred crore to the people. But we have
ensured that they save thousands of crores by providing bulbs at only fifty
Rupees. We have already distributed thirteen crore bulbs and we have
resolved to distribute 77 crores and I would like to appeal to my
countrymen to use LED bulbs in their homes and save 200, 300, 500
Rupees in a year and save energy and save our environment. The day we
achieve the target of 77 crore bulbs, we would be saving 20 thousand
Mega Watt of electricity. When we save 20000 Megawatt electricity, it
means we save around 125000 crores rupees. Brothers and Sisters, you
can save 125000 crore rupees of the country by using a LED bulb at your
home. We can fight against global warming by saving 20000 Megawatt
electricity and contribute a lot towards the efforts aimed at the protection of
environment and a common man can also contribute to it. So, brothers and
Sisters, we have worked in that direction-making the impossible possible.

You know that we depend on other countries of the world for energy and
petroleum products and for that we have signed long term agreements with
them so that we could get these products at fixed prices for a long period.
We have entered into an agreement with Qatar for buying gas till 2024 but
the prices are so high that it is costly for our economy. It was a result of our
foreign policy relationship that we were able to renegotiate with Qatar, and
the agreement which was the right of Qatar, and we were bound to buy gas
from it till 2024, we negotiated with them and today, I can say with
satisfaction that we made an impossible task possible, they renegotiated
their prices and it will save 2000 crore rupees of the exchequer of India.
They were entitled to get these 20000 crore rupees but the nature of
relationship that we have with them and our policies have made it possible.
The negotiations have been going on during the tenure of all the
Governments and efforts were also made for Chabahar Port, which is an
important link for connecting us with Central Asia, but today I feel satisfied
to see an impossible task becoming possible. When Iran, Afghanistan and
India collectively march ahead in a planned way for the construction of
Chabahar Port, an impossible task becomes possible.

My brothers and Sisters, one thing, I want to talk about and which concerns
the common man is inflation. It is true that the inflation rate had crossed
10% mark during the tenure of previous government. Due to our sustained
efforts we were able to keep it below 6 percent. Not only this, we have,
recently, made an agreement with the Reserve Bank of India that the RBI
should take steps to control the inflation at the level of 4 percent with
allowance of plus minus 2. We should leave behind the talks of balance
between inflation and growth and work for moving ahead. But the country
witnessed drought during last two years and the effect of drought are
readily seen on the prices of vegetables and the outcomes of sluggishness
of market have resulted in some problems. The decline in the production of
pulses due to drought during last two years was also a cause of concern.
But, Brothers and Sisters, if the inflation would have increased at the same
pace as it had previously increased, I don’t know how the poor of my
country would have survived? We have tried our best to keep it under
check, but still people have lot of expectations from this government and
dear countrymen your expectations are natural and I will not leave no stone
unturned in achieving them. Whatever best I can do, I shall do that and
keep the price of poor man’s meal under check.

My dear Brothers and Sisters, country is going to celebrate the 350th
anniversary of Guru Gobind Singhji. How can the country forget the saga of
sacrifice which has been the tradition of Sikh Gurus? Today, when we are
celebrating the 350th anniversary of Guru Gobind Singhji, I recall one best
thought expressed by Guruji. Guru Gobind Singhji use to say, how can I
consider those hands pure which have not done any service, hands which
have not strengthened by labour and have not developed any blisters by
toiling hard? Guru Gobind Singhji use to say this. Today, when we are
celebrating the 350th anniversary of Guru Gobind Singhji I remember our
farmers. Whose hands are more pure than theirs? Whose hearts are more
pious than their? Whose intentions can be more pure than theirs? I thanks
our farmers that despite two years of drought, they consistently endeavored
to fill our granaries, I greet them for this. Drought situation has changed
and this time we are witnessing good monsoon. Heavy rains have also
created problems at some places. Government of India stood with those
states and citizen who suffered due to heavy rains. Today, I specially want
to thank our farmers, because, when we are facing shortage of pulses and
our farmers have shifted to other crops, and rise in demand of pulses by
common man, I have to say this with content that this time our farmers
have increased the sowing by one and half times. I want to thank our
farmers because they have come forward to solve the problem of the crisis
of pulses and find its solution. We have decided the MSP for pulses and
declared a bonus on it. We have streamlined the process of purchase of
pulses and promoting the farmers for cultivation of pulses. This will benefit
us in a big way.

Brothers and Sisters, when I was talking about work culture, one thing was
clear that I do not look at the issues in isolation but as a whole. Let us see it
as integrated and just take agriculture under integrated things, we have
developed such work culture with lot of hard work, the complete chain of
which can produce a great result. First of all we focussed upon- the
wellness of this soil, wellness of this land, soil health card, macro-nutrition,
concern for micro-nutrition and made the farmers understand that this is
lacuna in your soil, these are the good qualities, your soil is good for this
crop, this is not suitable for this crop and gradually the farmers started their
planning according to this soil health card. The people, who have planned,
tell me, sir our expenditure has been reduced up to 25 percent and 30
percent increase is being visible our production. This number is less at
present, but in future as soon as this may pass on, this concept will gain
momentum. The farmers have land and if they get water, then the farmer of
my country has the power to produce gold out of the soil. The farmer of my
country has this power and that is why we have emphasized upon
water-management, emphasized upon water-irrigation, emphasized upon
water-conservation. We are emphasizing upon how every drop of water
may be utilised by the farmer, how to increase the importance of water, and
get per drop more crop, micro irrigation. More than 90 percent irrigation
projects were lying incomplete and stalled. We have taken up the
responsibility to complete those projects first of all and will work in the
direction that lakh of hectares of land may get the benefit of irrigation. We
have taken a big leap towards solar pump so that the input cost of the
farmers may be lessened because nowadays the farmers require electricity
also, they require water, they need electricity, and electricity costs dearer.
On account of it, the input cost of the farmer is going to be less, the
recurring expenditure is going to be less and due to owning solar pump at
home will result in owning electricity, owning the sun, owning the field,
owing the barn and thus our farmer would be happy. We have succeeded
in distributing 77 thousands solar pumps till now.

Brothers and Sisters, I would like to congratulate the scientists of our
country. Good quality seeds are also required along with soil, water and
solar pumps. The scientists of our country have developed more than 131
new farmable seeds compatible to the climate and nature of India, which
have the capacity to enhance our per hectare production. The values they
retain are also being increased. I heartly congratulate these scientists also.
The farmers require urea as well as fertilisers. There was time when black
marketing was in practice to get the fertilisers, there was time when the
police had to lathi-charge for fertilisers. There was time when the farmer
used to watch his crop being damaged in the absence of fertilisers before
his very eyes. Brothers and Sisters, the lack of fertilisers has become a
matter of past, it has become history now. Today, we have succeeded in
utmost production of fertiliser by overcoming the shortage of the fertiliser.

Brothers and Sisters, because of this production, the fertilizers are now
available to the farmers in time as per their needs. Similarly, We
conceptualized “Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana”. It’s insurance cover
includes maximum protection to farmer’s land and his agro-produce at a
comparatively much lower premium, and that too with a guaranteed cover.
We have constructed new warehouses to preserve 15 lakhs tons of food
grains. Our country’s farmers will benefit only when we move towards value
addition, and for this We have laid special emphasis on food processing for
the first time. We have encouraged cent percent Foreign Direct Investment
which would augment agro-based industries, and Consequentially, my
brothers and Sisters, I believe it would help me and our farmers realize our
dream of doubling latter’s income by 2022. These efforts would make it
possible and for realizing the same, We have taken steps one after
another.
Brothers and Sisters, Our country has a fancy for a trend. And the
Governments, with an aim to leave an impression, have done a lot, and to
fill the bill in this country, People go for some populist things and empty the
exchequer. Governments have a trend of establishing an identity. Brothers
and Sisters, I have tried my best to stay away from this allurement, and
While doing so, I have tried to do several things in every range with the
mantra of Total transformation, Transformation with transparency, Reform,
Perform and Transform.

Brothers and Sisters, We are far more committed to build the image of
Hindustan than that of our Government. Regardless of party’s identity, the
Country’s identity holds primacy. For, If the Country moves on, it will yield
dividends for the coming generations, for centuries, and exactly, for this
reason, We have accorded primacy to the country’s identity and not to our
party. Now a days, You must have observed the scope of our work in
Railways. While we are talking about having Bio-toilets in train, we also
cherish the dream of Bullet train. While We talk about “Soil Health Card” for
farmers, we also want to march ahead in the direction of satellite and space
technology. While talking about “Stand-Up India”, we are also taking steps
towards “Start-Up India”. We are laying emphasis on Substance than on
Symbolism. We are stressing on integrated development than on isolated
development. Leaving aside entitlement, we are focused and emphatic on
Empowerment because an empowering country, my brothers and Sisters,
provides an identity to the Government through the prism of the newly
declared schemes. But sometimes the old schemes just tumble down.
Nevertheless, the Govts. is a continuity. If the earlier Govts. have done
some work; then it is in the national interest that the next Government
rectifies their shortcomings and gives a go ahead to these schemes. The
arrogance that this was the work of your Government and this is my Govt;
hence we would not do this work; is not in the fitness of the things in a
democracy. This is why, with all humility, we have given similar importance
to the schemes of the previous governments. This is the hallmark of our
work culture as our nation is a continuous and a ceaseless system and we
wish to retain that system. This is why, I have a project called PRAGATI.
Under this project, every month, I myself sit and review all the on going
projects. You would be amazed to know that almost 119 projects worth Rs.
seven and a half lakh crores started by various previous Govts. were lying
pending. I got all of them going. I said, so much of money have been spent
on them, so, all these projects should be completed. Now they are all on
the way to completion. We created a project monitoring group. I asked
them to look into all such projects and find out as to when were they
started. I came to know that some of them were started 20 years ago, the
other were started somewhere between twenty five to thirty to fifteen years
earlier. The people living in the areas of these projects know all. We
identified such two hundred and seventy projects worth Rs. 10 Lakhs
crores which were inaugurated by some earlier govts. and some crores of
rupees were spent on all of them; but all that money was going down the
drain. We started all such stuck up projects once again. Brothers and
Sisters, such helding up and delaying of the schemes after having spent
crores of rupees on them is a criminal negligence and we have tried to tide
over such things.

Brothers and Sisters, earlier railway projects took at least two years in
getting sanctions. A train is passing from somewhere, road have also been
made on the both side; a rail over bridge is to be constructed. But the
approval took two years. We have speeded up the approval process and
have been able to shorten the approval time to three or four months, or
maximum to six months.

Brothers and Sisters, however fast we may work, whatsoever may be the
number of the schemes started by us; the touchstone of good
administration of any Government lies in the last man delivery or the
benefits accrued to that person. So, this has to be taken care off. Brothers
and Sisters, when policies are clear, intentions are clear; then the
sentiments behind the decisions are also a class apart and the decisions
can be taken unhesitantly. So, due to the correct policies and the correct
intentions our Government is taking unhesitant decisions and giving
emphasis on the last man delivery.

We have seen and if you also go through the newspapers of Uttar Pradesh,
every year there were stories about the outstanding balance of Sugar Cane
farmers. Every year, there was news that this is not being done by the
sugar mill owners, that was not being done by the state Govt, that sugar
cane farmers are in distress. Thousands of crores of the rupees was
outstanding. So, we made schemes in this regard and tired to ensure the
last man delivery and also ensured that the amount should reach to the
farmers. Brothers and Sisters, out of the total old outstanding balance of
the thousands of crores of rupees, I would like to inform you with a lot of
satisfaction that almost 99.5% has been settled. It has happened for the
first time after many years. I can point out in solace that all the sugarcane
which was procured and which came for marketing this time for that almost
95 per cent of farmers have got the price of sugarcane produced and I am
sure and I believe that the remaining 5 percent of farmers will also be paid
in the coming days.

Brothers & Sisters, We have initiated a mission to provide LPG
Connections to the poor families. We have launched a dynamic mission
under ""Ujawala"" scheme to get rid of smokes emanating from chulha for my
poor mothers. A target has been laid down to provide gas connections to 5
crores poor families within 3 years. Efforts are in progress and we have
already provided gas connections to around 50 lakhs and that also have
been done merely within the last hundred days - you can imagine - that it
may be possible to achieve the said target even before three years. We
intend to emphasis upon Last Mile Delivery in this mission.

Post has steadily become irrelevant due to onlining of our Post Offices,
Information Technology, Whatsapp, messages, e-mail. Our country is
known as the chains of Post Offices and we have revamped these post
offices. Post Offices are linked with poor and marginalised people.
Postman is the only representative of the Government who is linked with
the feelings and affections of the common man. We have never
safeguarded the interests of the Post Man who has always got the
affections of everyone and the postman always cares for common people.
We have taken measures to convert our post office into a Payment Bank.
By setting of these Payment Banks, a network of Banks will be set up
across the villages in the country. People will get the benefits of Jan-Dhan
account. The funds of MGNREGA for the common man is now being
transferred into their respective accounts through 'AADHAAR', the cases of
corruption are decreasing. Everyone will be benefitted through the mission
of converting the Post Office into a Payment Bank.

Brothers & Sisters, PSUs in our country are merely set up for loss-making
units or for turning into sick units slowly and steadily or for disinvestment.
This has been the common practice in the past. We have strived to launch
a new work-culture. Today, I can point out in satisfaction that we have
succeeded to turn the operation of so called notorious Air India into an
operational profit-making undertaking during the last year. It is a fact that
which all the Telcom companies of the world are profit-making units, the
BSNL was turning into a heavy loss-making undertaking. We have
succeeded in bringing BSNL to operational profit for the first time. Nobody
believed that the Shipping Corporation of India could also rake in profit,
now it is bringing profit. There was a time when it was apprehended that
how would a power factory last for a week. Whether we would be able to
get coal for them or not. It also used to be reported that power factories
have been shut down for want of coal. Now, we have sufficient stock of
coal at the threshold of the power factories. It could be used for months by
them. Dear Brothers & Sisters, we have achieved it.

Often, you must have seen that there is huge talk of corruption in our
country. I have observed it myself that how corruption has looked the poor
people from the lowest strata of the society and how huge amount of
money is being wasted. We have linked AADHAAR Card and AADHAAR
Number with the Government Policies. Dear Brothers & Sisters, earlier
there was a system under which funds used to be released from public
exchequer for widow pension, scholarship, persons with disabilities and
minorities and also we used to receive list of beneficiaries. We looked into it
deeply and found that even unborn children are also listed in it and getting
benefit out of such schemes. These middlemen used to siphon off billions
of rupees from it and nobody even took notice of it. But under the
AADHAAR System, we have removed all these middlemen from the list of
beneficiaries and directly transferred the amount to the beneficiaries and
found that these are millions of such ghost beneficiaries who do not exist at
all and used to receive billions of rupees from it. Now that has been
checked. We saved lot of amount. We decided to find out the needy
persons who were excluded from that list so that the amount of money
saved from it should invariably be deposited into the accounts of those
persons who want to fight for their rights. We have worked in that direction
to deliver it to the last man delivery and we have made it to reach it to
them.

All of us are aware of the Coal Scam. Today there is no accusation on the
coal auction. No stigma is attached to it. The states which excavate coal in
India, will continuously earn millions of rupees in the near future. There was
a time when the auction of spectrum was surrounded by allegations. We
auctioned it online and that has filled the coffers of the country, bringing
about healthy competition and also fetching benefits for the nation.

Dear Brothers and Sisters, today the world is passing through an era of
global economy. Every country today is inter-connected and
inter-dependent. Economically, the whole world is somehow
inter-connected in one way or other. However much we may progress in
our country, we’ll have to keep the global economy, global arena in view;
come up to the global standards, match it also to stay relevant, and
contribute, and also lead the global economy when the time comes.
Therefore, we’ll have to be alert all the time. We’ll have to comply with the
global standards to make ourselves up to date. Recently, you must have
seen how the World Bank, I.M.F., World Economic Forum, credit rating
agencies and such other agencies in the world have all appreciated the
progress of India. The world is constantly watching these things due to the
decisions taken one after another by India in respect of legal reforms,
improvement in system and changes in approach. We have very speedily
improved our ranking in `ease of doing business’ ratings. In terms of foreign
investment, with regard to foreign direct investment our country happens to
be the most favourite destination in the world today. We have left behind
even the big economies of the world in matters of growth rate and GDP.

Dear brothers and Sisters, do you know what an U.N. institute has
estimated about India for the next two years ? They have estimated that in
two years India will come up to the third spot in the economic sphere in
place of its present level at number ten. Brothers and Sisters, logistic
support, infrastructure, all these things are taken into account in global
standards, comparisons are made with rich countries of the world. Brothers
and Sisters, while making analysis regarding this logistic support and
infrastructure of India, the World Economic Forum has said that India has
reached above 19 ranks as compared to earlier positions and India is
moving up and marching ahead rapidly. Brothers and Sisters, the way we
are marching ahead with a dynamic and predictable economy in our
country and also in global reference- the recently passed GST law, is also
an empowering step towards it and all those parties deserve appreciations
for this.

Brothers and Sisters, I had talked about a campaign from the same place-
""Beti Bachao-Beti Padhao"". We do not do any work in piecemeal. We have
an integrated approach and I still need the cooperation of the society in the
initiatives which we have taken in ""Beti Bachao-Beti Padhao"". Every single
parent need to be aware. We should honour the daughters, protect them
and give them the benefit of government's schemes. We have covered
millions of families under ""Sukanya Samridhi Yojna"" which guarantees
benefits for the daughters when she grows up. We have given greatest
importance to the insurance schemes in which women are benefitted. They
are going to reap its benefits. We have ""Indradhanush Tikakaran Yojna""-
because if we ensure two things for our mothers and sisters i.e. economic
empowerment and empowerment against health problems and we educate
them, you can take it as an assurance that if even a single woman is
educated in the family, if she is strong physically and independent
economically, she has power to pull the poorest of the poor family out of
poverty and therefore we are working with emphasis on empowerment of
women, health of women, economic prosperity of women, physical
empowerment of women in our fight against poverty.

Therefore, my brothers and sisters, ""Mudra Yojna""- I am happy that more
than three and half crore families reaped the benefits of MudraYojna. In it,
most of the people who reached to the door of banks were first timers.
Even out of these almost 80 percent people were from SC/ST/OBC. Out of
these too, 80 percent are women who took loans from banks, Mudra bank.
This is to be considered that how will these womenfolk will contribute in
economic development. Brothers and Sisters! last week we decided that
our mothers and Sisters who have become the participants in the growth
story, need leave after child birth. Earlier that leave was shorter but now we
have increased this to 26 weeks, enabling the new mother to take care of
her infant. Our weavers and the people working in textile, who make yarn
and yarn rolls, used to get Rs.100.We have increased that to Rs.190 so as
to strengthen the hands of my yarn producing mothers and Sisters. Our
mothers, Sisters and weavers who are engaged in silk production will now
receive Rs.50 more per meter of production. This has also been decided
that this Rs.50 per meter will not go either to the trader or to the middleman
or to the dealer. Instead this Rs.50 per meter will go via Aadhaar directly to
the account of the weaver who has produced it. This will empower the
weavers. We have started schemes with this intention and effect is now
visible.
My dear countrymen! When we visualize railway and post office then we
are able to see the unity of India. More we increase the institutions
connecting India, our setup will change and that will enforce the unity of the
country. So in the same tune we have started a new market scheme for
farmers with the name ‘E-NAM”. Today farmers can sell their produce
online in any of the markets of the country. Now he is not constrained to
compulsively sell his produce in the market which is 10 Kilometers from his
field .Neither to sell at low prices which is not remunerative for his hard
work. Now a uniform sort of market network is establishing throughout the
country with ‘E-NAM’. GST is soon to result in uniform taxation system and
a unitary arrangement thus achieved will unite India as well. You will be
amazed to know that earlier a zone was to have surplus energy and there
were no takers. Another zone used to be in dire need of electricity, had to
remain in dark and factories used to be shut. To effect a change in this
scenario, we earned a great success with the ‘One nation, One grid, One
price’. Earlier it used to be Rs.10 per unit in summers but I went to
Telangana few days back to find it to be one rupee ten paise per unit
instead of that age old Rs. 10. This is the result of one-price system, which
can connect the whole country.

A worker of our county has to change his place of work after every one or
two years. But, his amount, deducted under EPF, is not transferred. You
will be surprised to know that when I took the charge of the Government,
Rs. 27,000 crore were lying under EPF, which belonged to the workers.
Workers were not able to claim their amount, as they were ignorant of the
relevant process. To solve this problem, we have issued a universal
account number to each worker, which would enable easy transfer of fund
to his new place of work. Now, the worker would get his amount after
retirement and it would no more be lying dormant in a government treasury.

We have strengthened various initiatives such as Bharat-Mala,
Setu-Bharatam, and Bharat-Net etc. We are working towards connecting
the whole country and towards economic development of the country
through all these initiatives.

Brothers and Sisters, this year is important due to various reasons. The
country is celebrating 1000th birth anniversary of Saint Sri Ramanuja
Acharyaji. The country is celebrating 150th birth anniversary of Shrimad
Rajchandra Ji, the Guru of Mahatma Gandhi. The country is celebrating
350th birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh ji. The country is also
celebrating centenary birth celebrations of Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyaya
ji. While remembering Sri Ramanuja Acharya ji today, I wish to underline
his message to the country. He used to say that we should serve all the
devotees of the Lord, irrespective of their caste and class. He had said that
we should never humiliate anyone and should give respect to all, without
any discrimination on the basis of age and caste. The issue that was given
importance by Gandhi, Ambedkar, Ramanujacharya, Lord Buddha, our
scriptures and by our all spiritual gurus too is the issue of 'our social unity'.

If the society disintegrates, the empire straggles, gets divided into the highs
and the lows, the touchables and the untouchables, then brothers and
Sisters, that society cannot sustain. There are social evils, centuries old
social evils, but if the social evils have become chronic, they need a bit
harsh and yet sensitive treatment. The lackadaisical attitude will not solve
the social problems and this is the responsibility of 125 crore citizens. The
government and the society together will have to steer through the social
conflicts. Brothers and Sisters, all of us will have to fight against the social
evils. We all will have to rise above social evils in our own behavior. Each
and every citizen will have to rise above them and then only we can build a
strong India. Without empowering our society, we cannot make India
strong. Mere economic progress does not guarantee a strong India, the
guarantee of a strong India lies in a strong society. And a strong society is
built at the edifice of social justice. A strong society is built only on the
edifice of social justice. Therefore, it is our duty to lay emphasis on social
justice. Whether they be Dalits, the downtrodden, the exploited, the
deprived, my Adivasi brothers, the rural population, the urban population,
the literate or the illiterate, the small or the big- the 125 crore of our fellow
countrymen constitute our family. We together have to take forward our
country and we all have to work in the same direction.

Brothers and Sisters, today the entire world acknowledges the fact that
India is a country of youths. What cannot be achieved by a country through
its youth power whose 65 percent population, about 800 Million people, is
below the age of 35 years? Therefore, my brothers and Sisters, it is the
need of the hour that the youth get opportunity and employment. Today we
are heading towards the birth centenary of Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyaya.
Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyaya spoke of welfare of the last human being
which was even the view of Mahatma Gandhi. Pandit Deen Dayal
Upadhyaya believed in the philosophy of ‘Antyodaya’. Welfare of the
poorest and the weakest was the central theme of the political philosophy
of Pt. Deendayal Upadhyayji. He used to say that every youth should get
education, every youth should be skilled and every youth should get the
opportunity to realise his dreams. We have taken many initiatives to realise
those dreams of Pt. Deendayalji and to fulfil the hopes and aspirations of
800 million youths of the country. The way the road network in the country
is expanding, the largest number of vehicles are being manufactured in the
country, the country is becoming the largest exporter of softwares, more
than 50 new mobile factories have been set up in the country, all these
things have created opportunities for the youths. If two crore door toilets
have been constructed, it has provided employment to someone, cement
has been procured from somewhere, iron has been purchased from some
other person, and the wooden work has been got done from somewhere
else. As the scope of work expands, the possibilities of employment
generation also increase. Today, we have stressed in that direction.

Similarly, we are working on 'skill development' as a mission so that crores
of youth could acquire skills. We have changed a law, though it seems very
small, and this law is 'Model Shop and Establishment Act'. We have sent
an advisory to states to give reasons why the big malls are allowed to open
365 days and upto 12 in the night but a small shopkeeper in the village has
to shut his shop after sunset. Even a poor should get the opportunity to
keep his shop open for 365 days. Why should our Sisters not get the
opportunity to work in night? We have made legal provisions so that our
Sisters could go to work in night also. There should be arrangements for
their safety and other requirements but they must get the opportunity to
work. These are the things which increase employment. Brothers and
Sisters, we are working in that direction and we are ready to do it.

Brothers and Sisters, this is the government, we are the persons who don't
believe in delaying the things, we know how to fight not how to delay, so
unless we deal with the problems head-on, it is not going to happen. Today
when we are celebrating our freedom in the country, someone among the
army jawans, who live and die for the country, would be ready for taking the
bullets on the border, someone will be sitting in bunker and some other one
would not be fortunate enough to meet his sister on the occasion of Raksha
Bandhan. How many jawans are working in armed forces? More than
33000 police personnel have got martyrdom since we got our
independence. Why should we forget them and how can we? These are
the people due to whom we can live a life of peace and happiness. The
issue of “One Rank One Pension” was pending for many years. We do not
keep the issues pending but we face them. We have fulfilled our promise of
“One Rank One Pension” and have spread happiness in the home of every
Indian soldier. We did this work.

It was the feeling of our countrymen that the files pertaining to Netaji
Subhash Babu should be declassified. Today, I bow my head and say that
without caring for the result we have decided to declassify these files; a
task which was impossible and kept pending since long. We invited Netaji’s
family members and shown them the files and this process of declassifying
will continue. I requested the other countries of the world to declassify the
files held by them and hand them over to India because Indians have full
right to know about Subhash Babu and history of India. We have worked in
that direction.

Bangladesh -- When partition of India took place, a boundary dispute
existed since then. A boundary dispute prevailed since the formation of
Bangladesh. Many decades passed. Brothers and Sisters, all parties have
together solved the Indo-Bangladesh border dispute and we have amended
the constitution also.

Brothers and Sisters, a middle class person wants to construct his own
house, wants to buy a flat. Builders lobby shows him a beautifully printed
booklet and the helpless soul falls prey to it. He is not having any technical
knowledge, he pays the installments but he is not getting the promised
house in time. A middle class makes one house in his whole life and in it he
invests all his capital. Brothers and Sisters, we have put a check by
passing the “Real Estate Bill”, so that a middle class should not face any
problem if he wishes to own a house. We have worked for this.

Brothers and Sisters, I have already said that this year is the 150th
anniversary of Shrimad Rajchandra Ji, the guru of Mahatma Gandhi. When
Gandhiji was staying at South Africa, then also he was having
correspondence with Shrimad Rajchandra Ji. In one of his letter Shrimad
Rajchandra Ji discussed violence and non-violence. In that letter
Rajchandra Ji writes, when violence came in to existence from same time
the principle of non-violence also born. The important thing in both is that
which we prefer or which is being used in the interest of mankind.

Brothers and Sisters, the discussion of violence and non-violence is very
inherent in our country. Humanity is in our blood. We are the people of a
great, colossal culture. This country is full of diversity, colours and beauty.
This is such a bouquet of mother India wherein all type of fragrances, all
type of colours and all type of dreams exist. Brothers and Sisters, the unity
of diversity is our biggest strength. The mantra of unity is connected to our
roots.

Brothers and Sisters, a country having more than hundred languages,
hundreds of dialects, innumerable attires, innumerable life styles, despite
that this country remained united- its main reason is our cultural heritage.
We know how to respect, we know hospitality, we know how to assimilate,
we have carried this great tradition and that is why there is no room for
violence and atrocity in our country. If the democracy of India is to be
strengthened, the dreams of India are to be fulfilled then the path of
violence would never bring success for us. Nowadays a game of killing the
innocents is being played on the pretext of Maoism in forests, on the
pretext of extremism at border, on the pretext of terrorism at hilly areas by
carrying guns on shoulders. Forty years have passed, this mother soil has
grown blood stained but the persons on the path of terrorism have not
achieved anything. I would like to remind those youth that this country will
never tolerate violence nor would it ever put up with terrorism. Nor would it
bow down to terrorism. It will never succumb to Maoism. But I exhort them
and say that you still have time-return to the mainstream. Just think about
your parents' dream; just reflect on the hopes and expectations of your
parents; return back to the mainstream; live a happy and peaceful life, for,
the path of violence never fetches benefit to anybody.

Brothers and sister, we talk about foreign policy. I don't want to go into
details. We had invited the leaders of SAARC Countries on the day we took
oath at the Centre. Our message was clear that we all, neighbouring
countries, have a common problem, and that common challenge is poverty.
Let us fight this poverty together, by fighting one-another, we are left
shattered but if we fight this poverty, we will walk towards prosperity. So, I
exhort all neighbouring countries to join us in this fight against poverty. No
freedom can be much bigger than the freedom of our citizens from poverty;
freedom of our country's citizen from poverty. No liberation is more
liberating than the freedom from poverty. Whenever a citizen from the
neighbouring countries would get freedom from poverty, we will feel elated
regardless of the fact whether the poor belongs to us or our neighbouring
country.

   Brothers and Sisters, what kind of people are those who got drive from
humanity and, what is the kind of those who reward terrorism? I want to
place two pictures before this world, and I say to the world, I say to those
who believe in humanity that just weigh out the attack, when terrorists
brutally killed innocent children in a school at Peshawar. The attack take
place in Peshawar, and was a terrorist incident. The innocent children
became victim of the bloodbath; the temple of learning had blood stream all
around; innocent children were slaughtered. Hindustan, the Parliament had
tears in it's eyes; Every Indian school was in tears; every child of India felt
the trauma of the deaths of children in Peshawar. His tears had become
unstoppable. Every child, who was killed in Peshawar in the terrorist attack,
ached our heart too. This is the drive of our nurtured culture of humanity;
this is our humanity, but if you look around, you will find a more to glorify
terrorists.

Where innocent people are killed in terrorist attack, and they celebrate,
what type of terrorism inspired life it is, what type of these creations of the
terrorism inspired governments are? The world will understand these two
differences properly, this is sufficient for me. Today I want to specially
honour and thank to some people from the ramparts of Red Fort. For the
past few days the people of Baluchistan, the people of Gilgit, the people of
Pakistan occupied Kashmir, the way their citizens have heartily thanked
me, the way they have acknowledged me, the goodwill they have shown
towards me, the people settled far across, the land which I have not seen,
the people I have not met ever, but people settled at far across
acknowledge the Prime Minister of India, they honour him, so it is an
honour of my 125 crores countrymen, it is respect of my 125 crores
countrymen and that is why owing to the feeling of this honour, I want to
heartily thank the people of Baluchistan, the people of Gilgit, the people of
Pakistan occupied Kashmir for having an expression of thankfulness.

Brothers and Sisters, today when we are celebrating the seventy years of
Independence, then there is a big contribution of freedom soldiers for the
country. When there is a contribution of these freedom soldiers, then the
Government is deciding to increase 20 percent in the honouring amount
being received, pension being received by the all these honourable
freedom soldiers family members. The freedom fighters who earlier used to
get 25000 rupees, will now get 30000 rupees. It is my small effort to pay my
respects to the sacrifice and oblation of our freedom fighters.

Brothers and Sisters, when we talk about the history of freedom struggle of
our country, some persons are talked about a lot, some are excessively
mentioned but the contribution made by the people living in jungles, the
tribals, in the freedom struggle was unmatched. They used to live in
jungles. We hear the name of Birsa Munda but perhaps there would be no
tribal dominated district where the tribals would not have fought and given
sacrifice since 1857 to the time we got freedom. They proved through their
sacrifice what is freedom, what is struggle against servitude. But our
forthcoming generations are not much aware of this history. The
government desires and plans that in the coming days, in the states where
these freedom fighters, who were tribals, who lived in jungles, fought
against Britishers, who were not ready to succumb. The Government would
work towards building permanent museums in various states dedicated to
tribal brave freedom fighters, wherever land would be available for the
purpose, where their contributions and memoirs would be displayed, so
that coming generations could be able to know about their sacrifices for the
country.

Brothers and Sisters, in the midst of the debate on inflation, we are
realising one fact that the entire economy of a poor household is affected if
somebody falls ill. The wedding of their daughters gets stalled, the
education of children gets stalled and sometimes even food is not available
in the evening. Healthcare is getting costlier and that is why, I am
announcing an important scheme from the ramparts of the Red Fort for the
healthcare of BPL families. Under this scheme, in the coming days, if such
poor families have to take medical facilities, the government will bear
expenditure upto Rs.1 lakh per year, so that my poor brothers are not
deprived of healthcare facilities and their dreams are not shattered.

My dear Brothers and Sisters, let us proceed forward with a new
determination, new energy, new enthusiasm by getting inspiration from
those great persons who scarified their lives for our freedom. We did not
get an opportunity to die for the country but we have the opportunity to live
for the country. We should dedicate our life to the nation. We should
achieve something of substance for the nation. We should fulfill our
responsibilities and also inspire others to accomplish their responsibilities.
We should stride forward for building of one society, one dream, one
resolution, one direction and one destination. With this very pious feeling, I
once again bow my head before the great personalities of the country, the
soldiers who risk their lives for our security on water, land and air fields and
also those 33 thousands martyrs who sacrificed their lives for us. So, I,
hereby, dedicate myself to dream about the future of the country and call
on all of you from the rampart of the Red Fort to speak with your full might :
Bharat Mata Ki Jay! Let the voice reach to every corner of the world.

Bharat Mata Ki Jay! Bharat Mata Ki Jay! Bharat Mata Ki Jay!

Vandematram! Vandematram! Vandematram !

Jay Hind! Jay Hind! Jay Hind!

Thank you."
2015,Narendra Modi,BJP,NA,English rendering of PM’s address to the Nation from the ramparts of the Red Fort on the 69th Independence Day,Press Information Bureau,https://pib.gov.in/,"My Beloved 125 Crore countrymen of India,

My best wishes and heartiest greetings on the occasion of this sacred
festival of our Freedom. This morning of the 15th of August is not a usual
morning. This is the dawn of the freedom-festival of the greatest democracy
of the world. This dawn is also the dawn of the dreams of the one hundred
twenty five Crore Indian Citizens. This dawn also heralds the resolve of 125
Crore people of India. On this pious occasion I also extend my many many
salutations to all those great persons of India who sacrificed their lives and
led a life of penance while making persistent efforts to fight for the honour
of the country. They even spent their youth in the prison, went through all
kinds of sufferings; but never gave up their dreams and resolve to see India
free.

Recently many distinguished citizens of India, youths, literary artists and
social workers- sons and daughters of Mother India- have achieved many
great feats to make our country proud. They are countless in number and
from the ramparts of Red fort I extend my best wishes and greetings to all
of them from the core of my heart.

The vastness and the diversity of India is always talked about, but Our
India has many other great characteristics as well, there is a lot of diversity
in India. India is a large country. And there is simplicity among the people
of India. There is unity running through all the parts of the country and that
is what is our strength; the strength of our nation. Strength of our country
has been sustained over centuries together. Every era has seen the
attempts to boost it further. They have been moulded according to the
requirements of realising the dreams for the future, they have been
nurtured and it is due to that only that this country has reached this far with
our age old traditions and ever new resolves. Our unity, simplicity,
fraternity, harmony are our biggest strength. This strength should never be
blemished, it should never be hit. If the unity of the country gets disturbed,
the dreams also get shattered, therefore, whether it is the poison of
casteism, communal fanaticism, we don’t have to allow it in any form
whatsoever, not allow it to take root, and then we have to cure the poison
of casteism, the fanaticism of communalism with the nectar of
development, distribute the flow of the nectar of development and through
the flow of this nectar attempt bringing about a new awareness.

Dear brothers and sisters, this country is moving ahead because of the
""Team India"" and this ""Team India"" is a big team of our one twenty five
crore countrymen. The world might never have thought about the team of
one twenty five crore citizens working as a team together as to how they
take the nation to new heights, build the nation and also protect it! So,
whatever we are doing and wherever we are trying to reach, it is all
because of the ""Team India"" and we are grateful to this ""Team India"".
People’s participation is the biggest strength of democracy. If we run the
country through the participation of One Hundred and twenty five crore
Indians, our country will be moving ahead one hundred and twenty five
crore steps every moment. That is why we have encouraged this people's
participation as ""Team India"". We have given priority to ""Team India"".
Through electronic platform mygov.in, through lacs of letters of the
countrymen, through my Mann Ki Baat, through dialogues with citizens, this
people’s participation is on the rise day by day. About every affair of the
Government we receive a number of suggestions from the far flung villages
of our country and this is the real strength of our ""Team India"".

My dear fellow citizens, this is a fact that there is only one mandate of this
""Team India"" and that is all our schemes, all our systems should benefit the
poor of the country. We should support the poor in their fight against
poverty and empower them in this arduous effort of theirs because no one
wants to remain poor and they also wish to get rid of poverty. Hence the
meaningfulness of our resources, our schemes and our programmes is in
their usefulness to the cause of welfare of the poor.
Brothers and sisters, last year on the occasion of 15th of August, I had
expressed some of my views before you. At that time I was new, whatever I
saw in the government, I expressed them with an open mind before one
hundred and twenty five crore citizens. Today after one year, standing
under the Tricolor from the same ramparts of the Red Fort , I assure the
countrymen that in this period of one year our ""Team India"", consisting of
one hundred and twenty five crore people, is committed to realize our
dreams within the timeframe with new hope, new energy and utmost hard
work. An atmosphere of trust has emerged. I had announced ‘Pradhan
Mantri Jan Dhan Yojna’ on the last 15th of August. Even after sixty years of
independence; even when the banks were nationalized for the poor, 40%
people of the country were without a bank account till the last 15th of
August; the doors of the banks were not open for the poor. We resolved
that we would erase this blot and would provide a solid base to the financial
inclusion which is talked about the world over, by integrating the poorest of
the poor to the mainstream economic activities; and this is only the
beginning. We had decided that unlike the previous work culture of talking
in terms of uncertain time frames, we will complete the work by the 26th of
January as the country celebrates the next Republic Day.

My countrymen, today I can proudly say that we achieved that target within
the time frame. 17 Crore people opened their bank accounts under
‘Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojna’. With a view to extend opportunities to
the poor, we had said that these bank accounts could be opened with zero
balance. We had even said that we would bear the operational costs of the
bank. After all, what for the banks exist? They should be for the poor and
that’s why we had decided to open accounts with zero balance. We have
seen the rich of our country; however, this time around we have also seen
our poor and seen their wealth. From the ramparts of the Red Fort, let me
salute and bow to the large-heartedness of these poor; because even if
there was a provision of opening the account with zero balance, these poor
people have deposited twenty thousand crore rupees in their bank
accounts. It could be possible only due to richness of our poor citizens. And
hence, today my conviction bears proof that it is all because of the spirit of
these poor that this ""Team India"" will march ahead.

Brothers and sisters, if the branch of a bank is opened or a building of the
bank is constructed in a certain part of our country, it becomes the hot topic
of discussion, people rejoice, it is hailed as a mark of great development
and remarkable progress. This is so because in the past 60 years, we have
measured the development of the country only on the basis of these
parameters. This has been the yardstick that if any branch of a bank is
opened somewhere, it elicits lots of accolades and praises, the
Government receives much adulation, but my dear fellow citizens, it is not a
challenging task to open a branch of a bank. This task can easily be
accomplished through the Government exchequer, but to bring 17 crore
countrymen to the doorstep of the bank is an arduous task, it takes a lot of
hard work, you have to give your heart and soul to accomplish this task,
you are required to be ever vigilant. And here I would extend my heartfelt
congratulations to various Banks and their employees who have been a
very significant part of ""Team India"". I congratulate them for making banks
so easily accessible to the poor and this fact will bring a major change in
the coming days.

Among the global economic schools of thought, there is also the one which
maintains that financial inclusion doesn’t always bring positive results and
due to that the system has to bear the pressure of poverty. I disagree with
this thought. In a country like India, if we look at the pyramid of
development, its base is the broadest. If it be firm, the entire pyramid of
development tends to be strong. Today the downtrodden, the exploited,
oppressed, deprived, and the ignored ones of our country form the base of
the pyramid of development. We have to strengthen the foundation of this
pyramid of development so as to ensure that these people are empowered
through financial inclusion and this pyramid of development remains
unshakable. It would stand firm amid any crisis and if this pyramid of
development is based on economic strength, it would increase the
purchasing power of these people to a great extent. And when the
purchasing power of the poorest of the poor in the society increases,
nobody can stop that economy to flourish and move ahead. It takes the
country swiftly to the newer heights of development and therefore it is our
intention to give impetus to that. We have laid great stress upon social
security and also the welfare of the poor - and thus Prime Minister's
Suraksha Bima Yojana, Atal Pension Yojana and Prime Minister's Jeevan
Jyoti Bima yojana have been launched. Crores of the people of our country
have no social security cover. Leave the poor aside, benefit of insurance
has not reached even the lower middle class. So we made a plan - just pay
one rupee per month, not more, that is just Rs. 12 per annum and be
entitled to the benefits of Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana. If your
family faces any calamity then they will receive 2 lac rupees. We know how
to manage an economy ! That's why we launched Prime Minister's Jeevan
Jyoti Bima Yojana for 90 paisa a day, even less than 1 rupee. So it is Rs.
330 annually for the health of one's family - and for the security of one's
family- insurance of 2 lac rupees. This is what we have done.

Brothers and sisters, schemes have been made in the past also. There is
no Government which doesn't make schemes. Every Government does
that. There is no government which doesn't make announcements. Every
Government does that. There is no government which doesn't light the
inauguration lamps, doesn't cut ribbons--every Government does that. But
the touchstone is whether we walk the talk or not. We have laid a great
stress upon a new work culture. Dear Countrymen, our nation has many
schemes which are 40 years old or 50years old but these schemes could
not reach more than 5 or 7 crore people. This scheme has just completed a
hundred days, 100 days! I mean it, and in these hundred days ten crore
citizens have been benefited 10 crore people! Ten crore citizens of this
country means ten crore families. And this means that out of total 30-35
crore families of our country, ten crore families have joined this scheme
within a span of hundred days.
Brothers and sisters, the uniqueness of our government, of ""Team India"",
during last one year, especially the great strength and the biggest
achievement of ""Team India"", consisting of one hundred and twenty five
crore people has been to fulfill the tasks within the set time frame.

Last year I referred to toilet facilities for all from this Red Fort, I also
referred to cleanliness. It sounded strange to the whole country for a few
hours as to what sort of Prime Minister is this! But today in all the surveys
that has been carried out in the entire country, this point has come out in all
of them that if there is something that is the most important factor of ""Team
India"" and that has touched every person, is the movement towards
cleanliness.

Brothers and sisters, we used to invoke the people of the society and
marked the names of various people to promote the ""cleanliness drive"".
That was such a period, but today I have to congratulate this ""Team India"".
People from all walks of life whether they are Celebrities, Diplomats, Social
Workers, Educationists, community leaders or spiritual leaders or our
friends from media, all of them have taken a major responsibility to train the
common man without criticising anybody and without pointing towards the
lacunas. Today I greet them all from the core of my heart who have done
this job but I only wish to stress upon a point- from whom this ""Swachh
Bharat"" drive has gained maximum strength? Who are its biggest brand
ambassador? You may not have paid heed to it, but try to remember what
happened in your family? There are crores of such families in India, whose
children are in the age group of five, ten and fifteen and they have become
the greatest ambassador of ""Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan"". These children
prevent their parents from littering in their homes and ask them to avoid
spreading filth and rubbish here and there. In case, any father is addicted
to consuming gutka and whenever the father opens the windows of the car
to spit, his son prevents him to do so on the plea of keeping India clean.
The success of this programme is due to those little children. I wish to bow
my head towards the future of my country, I wish to bow my head and greet
those children. The fact which is not realized even by the elite people has
been easily understood by the innocent children and it is my belief that
such a country where a child is so much aware, so committed towards
cleanliness, such country is bound to become clean; Abhorrence against
filth and dirt is bound to arise there.

In 2019 we are about to celebrate the 150th anniversary of Mahatma
Gandhi and on 150th anniversary of Gandhiji we have to handover him
""Swachh Bharat"" as a tribute. There cannot be a greater tribute to
Mahatma Gandhi on his 150th birth anniversary. The task has just started,
but I have to take it forward, not to stop it, not to get satisfied. I had
announced such a programme from here, just for a trial, so that I could
ascertain whether ""Team India"" is able to do it or not. I had announced it
without consulting anybody. It was not announced after collecting relevant
information from districts and villages. It just came into my heart and I had
announced that we would build separate toilets for boys and girls in all of
our schools till the next 15th August. But later on, when we started work,
the ""Team India"" figured out its responsibilities, we realised that there were
2 lakh and 62 thousand such schools, where more than 4.25 lakh toilets
were required to be built. This figure was so big that any government could
rethink to extend the deadline, but it certainly was the resolve of the '""Team
India""' that no one sought any extension. Today, on this 15th August, I
salute the ""Team India"", who, keeping the honour of our tricolour National
Flag, left no stone unturned to realise that dream, and the '""Team India""'
has now nearly achieved the target of building all the toilets. I compliment
all the state governments, government officers of the districts, policy
framers and implementers of educational institutions, who were involved in
realising this achievement. This is not just an issue of building more than
4.25 lakh toilets. This is an issue of creating an atmosphere of
self-confidence at a time, when we were so engulfed with the negativity that
it was being told that nothing could happen, there was no hope, it was not
possible. But now, the ""Team India"" has demonstrated that we are ready to
accept challenges, we would not withdraw, and we are committed for our
success. The nation runs on this self-confidence, the nation runs by
realising newer resolutions. We cannot stop anywhere, we have to
continuously move forward. Therefore, Brothers and Sisters, we have
prepared a plan for the labourers of our country, and it has been named as
""SHRAMEVA JAYATE"". Our attitude towards the poor labourers is not
good.

If we meet a person wearing coat, pants, tie or we meet a great person
wearing long kurta, jacket we salute him by standing in his honour. But if an
auto rickshaw driver, pedal rickshaw puller, newspaper vendor or a
milkman come to us, our feelings towards these poor men are not proper.
One hundred and twenty five crore citizens of the country have to remove
this deficiency of the nation by their resolution of mind. The persons due to
whom we look good, who serve us good, no one is our better well wisher
than them and therefor, dignity of labourers, honour of labourers, pride of
labourers- this should be our national duty , this should be our national
character, this should be the tendency of everyone, nature of everyone.
Recently, we started a campaign of issuing special identity card to the
unorganized labour falling under certain schemes. They are to get the
benefits of many schemes of security through that identity card. These
unorganized labourers were never taken care of. Similarly, labourers of our
country had deposited their share of hard earned money in Government
coffers. Slowly, this amount grew to Rs. 27 thousand crores, but when that
poor labourer moves to some another place after 6-8 months of
employment there, moves to another place after a year or two from there,
no account of the money he deposited there is maintained. The amount is
also so low that he does not wish to bring back the same by spending two
hundred rupees on fare. That is why Rs. 27 thousand crores of poor people
of my country, labourers of my country, money earned by them by the
sweat of their brow was lying idle in the coffers of the Government. We
found a solution to it. We provided a special identity card number to these
labourers and told them wherever you are transferred now, even if you
move to another place by quitting the job or if you move from one factory to
another, from one state to another, you will always retain this number and
you will retain your money, no one will be able to misappropriate your
single rupee. So, we have tried to return the Rs. 27 thousand crores to the
poor.

It has become a fashion in our country- make law for everything and keep
our courts busy. One law may contradict the other but the law should be on
the same subject. Confusion was being created here always. This is not a
good sign for good governance and therefor, law should be explicit, law
should be correct, law should not be out of sync with time, only then society
progresses.

Where will a poor labourer look for his thing of interest in the pile-up of
different types of 44 legislations meant for our labourers? We have brought
about a change therein. By incorporating these 44 legislations into four
codes of conduct, the poorest of the poor and even an illiterate labourer
can know about his or her interest, we have emphasized this scheme.

Brothers and Sisters, corruption is a much discussed topic in our country.
We must have seen an ailing person, habitually, giving tips to others on
how to be healthy. He does not care for himself, but it is the nature of every
human being to advise others that you do it and you will become healthy
and you do that and you will become healthy. Corruption is also like this.
The person involved in it, also advise, the person who is suffering due to it,
also advise and thus they advise each other, and this goes on and on.

Brothers and Sisters, I have never made this announcement, but today I
wish to state, I want to assure my fellow countrymen, I want to tell the
""Team India"" comprising 1.25 billion people that this country can become
corruption-free. On the basis of experience I am saying this. This job has to
be started from the top. Corruption is stuck with our country like a termite
and the termite keeps on spreading, initially it is not visible, but when it
spreads in our bedroom and reaches the cupboard where clothes are hung,
we find that and when we want to get rid of it, insecticides have to be
injected per square meter of land. After so many of years of efforts, we get
rid of termite. Countless efforts of several types have to be made to wipe
out the corruption in such a vast country, and that can be done. If I had said
that I would cut subsidy worth Rs. 15 thousand cores on LPG gas, then I
can say that hundreds of articles would have been written to glorify my
Government. They can say that this man has the power and strength to
discontinue the subsidy worth Rs. 15 thousand cores on LPG gas. It is this
man who can take tough decision and if it is not done so, then nothing
happens my dear friends and nothing is visible. Sometimes people are fond
of sinking into despair. Until they talk of despair amongst people they can
not sleep at night.

They have this habit. There are some ailing people, who do not like to
disclose about their illness and they also do not like to someone inquiring
about their ailment. While there are some others who wait for a particular
person to enquire about their health and if he does not visit, they talk about
this for hours together. I can see that there are some people who always
search for negativism, propagate negativism and they enjoy it as much as
they can. Such people neither have any schemes nor activities, yet ""Team
India' consisting of 1.25 billion Indians is ready to invest time for them, but
how does that happen? We have put in place a scheme of Direct Benefit
Transfer of LPG subsidy. Taking advantage of Jan Dhan Accounts and
Aadhaar Card we have transferred the subsidy directly into the accounts.
As a result of this the brokers, the middlemen and the blackmarketeers
have disappeared. Only the real beneficiary got the benefit. Our
Government have neither slashed a penny from anyone's benefit nor we
have made announcements to earn praise. We have improved the system
and today I wish to inform the 'Team India' of 1.25 billion Indians that as a
result of this an amount of Rs.15,000 crore, which was being siphoned off
annually in the name of gas cylinders has been stopped. My countrymen,
the corruption has stopped.
My brothers and sisters, you can see how work is done? We have done it.
Rupees 15,000 crore is not a small amount for a country like India. We
have launched an open website, displayed a board of delivery there, even
then if someone has a complaint, he would get a cylinder even at midnight
but we cannot permit those who loot the country and poors as well. Tell me
whether this is not a fight against corruption?

My brothers and sisters, I had made a request to my countrymen that if you
are economically sound, then why do you avail subsidy on L.P.G? Why do
you need this paltry amount of rupees five to seven hundred which you
usually spend on petty snacks. I had just started giving message about this,
I didn't launch any campaign as yet, because I have faith in ""Team India'.
As the message spreads the result would come, but to-day I can tell with
pride that ever-since I had launched movement of ""give it up"" subsidy of
LPG gas cylinder, till date 20 lakh consumers have already given it up.

This is not a small figure. Even if we are in the queue before a temple for
the blessings (Prasad), we sometimes wish that we should get some of the
prasad for our younger brother also. This is in our nature. These 20 lakh
people are not from rich or wealthy families. They are all from the common
middle class. Some teacher may have been a pensioner, but when he
learnt that this LPG cylinder may go to some poor person, he gave up his
subsidy. My dear brothers and sisters, when these 20 lakh LPG cylinders
will reach the poor families whose kitchens are smoke choked, just think of
the happiness of the mothers working in those kitchens! Just think of the
relief and happiness of the little children who had been crying due to the
smoke! Whenever our efforts are in the right direction, we get great results.

My brothers and sisters, if I talk about coal, some of the political pundits or
experts will judge me on a political angle. This is not a place for politicking,
so I would like to urge upon all the political pundits that in this case, the
kind of coal issue that I am going to raise, may please not be judged
through the political angle. This is the requirement of our nation’s resolve.
CAG said that when coal blocks were allocated through lottery, the nation
lost Rs.1 lakh and 74 thousand crores. We also used this statistics in the
election-speeches. Nevertheless, we sometimes thought that this much of
loss may not have been there. But we went on saying like that. Later we
decided that whether it be coal, or spectrum or any other mineral, all will be
auctioned henceforth. Lo and behold ! the great strength of the Team India
of 125 crore Indians and their resolve ! within a certain time limit the coal
was auctioned and now almost Rs. 3 lakh crore would be accruing to the
national exchequer.

Brothers and sisters, just ask yourselves whether corruption was rooted out
or not? Whether the middlemen were ousted or not? Whether the door was
shut on the face of the wealth-stealers of India or not? I did not make any
speech in this regard. I just did it. The same thing happened in the case of
spectrum. Right now FM radio auction is going on. A lot of pressure was
put on me. People said 'Modi ji, FM is operated by the common men, there
in no great profit in this business. Why are you putting even FM on auction?
A lot of pressure was put on me. All attempts were made to dissuade me
from this. But I said that the team India consisting of 125 crore of Indians
wanted transparency.

Right now the auction is on for FM Radio in some 80-85 cities. The day
before when I enquired, the auction amount had crossed Rs. one thousand
crores. This money is going to be used for the poor people.

Brothers and sisters, what a run the country had at the hands of its
leadership, how it was looted, what impact was put on the policies! What
kind of an activity it was that continued in the country? Imported coal from
the foreign countries was not given to the power plants near the coasts. It
was transported to the factories of nearby areas of coal mines and the coal
from those mines instead was taken to the factories in the coastal region.
Now, even a small child in this country can understand as to how the goods
can be utilized for the place where they are situated instead of going for
their transport from that place to the other.

Brothers and sisters, we changed that decision. Nearby factories should be
the first beneficiaries. And let me say that this small decision closed down
the shops of the middlemen and the exchequer has got Rs. 1100 crores.
My dear citizens, it will happen every year now.

Corruption in a way has become part of the system. Until it is stamped out
from the system, dear brothers and sisters, I’ll keep suffering every atrocity,
facing every obstacle but with your blessings I shall fulfill the dream of a
corruption free India. I say this to you from the ramparts of the Red Fort
with the tricolour as my witness and the understanding of the dreams of the
125 crore people. It’s been 15 months since you put our Government in
Centre and gave me the mandate. This Government does not have any
allegation of corruption against it for even a single penny. But I had said
alongside that it was like the pests, the termite. Corruption free
Government in Delhi only is not going to solve the whole problem. There
are problems at the small places right now and the poor are getting
troubled. We need to bring in a national level awareness for this. We need
to comprehend this menace of corruption properly and get everyone on
board to eradicate it. Then only can we get rid of the menace.

Brothers and sisters, let me say further that we have taken some very
important steps one after the other to check black money, and that too in a
very short span of time.

The day we formed the Government, we constituted an SIT under the
supervision of the Supreme Court. We did what was pending for three
years. The SIT is doing its job. I attended the G-20 summit. These are the
countries whose support we need for bringing black money back. On
India’s insistence a resolution was passed against black money. All G-20
countries resolved to cooperate with each other and send back the black
money to the country where it belonged. We adopted FATCA along with
the United States. We have signed agreements with many countries for
receiving real time information regarding Indian’s black money. We have
taken several measures to check black money.

Brothers and sisters, we have passed a strict law for this. After this
enactment every week people call us and complain that we have passed a
very stringent law. They call it a draconian law and a black law and say that
officers would harass them. Dear fellow citizens, we need injections if the
disease is serious. Doctors also warn us about the side effects of such
injections. Similarly, this disease is so serious that if we want a treatment,
we will have to bear the side effects also. I know that people are upset with
the law which we have passed. They find it troublesome. We have received
many messages for diluting the provisions and relaxing it. Today I would
like to tell Team India of 125 crore countrymen that even while bearing the
side effects, we are moving forward against black money. This much has
been done. It’s a fact that the process of bringing back the black money is
long but now no one can dare to send the black money out of the country.
This much has been achieved, whether someone believes it or not. Not
only this, we have given some grace period for declaring undisclosed
income and today I can say that people have come forward and declared
their undisclosed income amounting to Rs. 6500 crores. This amount will
accrue to our exchequer. It will benefit the poor of India. Friends, I assure
you all that we will move forward with all the resolve to fulfill the
commitments we have made.

Brothers and sisters, CBI had registered only eight hundred cases in the
entire one year before formation of our government. We are still new in
power but we have already registered eighteen hundred cases since we
took charge; we have taken action against government employees. You
can easily imagine and compare the figures. In the entire one year before
we came to power, only eight hundred cases were registered and in the ten
months of our government the corresponding number is eighteen hundred.
It shows our ability to fight corruption.

In 2005, a law namely ‘PMLA’ was framed in our country. In ten years, an
amount of ten thousand crore rupees has been recovered under that law.
But you would be surprised to know that out of the total recovered amount
of ten thousand crore rupees, four thousand five hundred crore rupees
have been recovered in the last ten months. This is another example of our
commitment to fight corruption about which we are not talking in press
conferences on TV; rather we have taken steps on the ground and reaped
success. We have endeavored to change systems. We have taken steps to
ensure that the ‘MGNREGA’ wages go directly to the Jan Dhan account;
that the scholarship for students goes directly into their bank accounts; and
that there is least brokerage. And I believe that because of these steps the
country can fulfill those objectives.

My farmer brothers and sisters, last year we had deficient rainfall. It was
less than required. It affected the economy as well as our farmers. We
were still able to curb the price rise. One will have to admit the fact that
before us, the inflation was in double digits. Since we came to power,
although there has been less rain and the farmers were distressed; we
have been successful in bringing down the inflation from double digits to
3-4 percent. We will continue to strive to bring it further down because our
dream is to provide wholesome meals to the poorest of the poor. However,
we need drastic changes in the agriculture sector. The cultivable land is
shrinking; it is getting divided between families and pieces of land are
getting smaller. The fertility and productivity of our agricultural land must
increase. The farmers need water and electricity and we are working
towards their availability. We have decided to pump in fifty thousand crore
rupees in ‘Pradhaan Mantri Krishi Sinchaai Yojna’. How will the water reach
the farms? Water will have to be saved. We have to launch a movement in
our agricultural sector with the mantra of “Save Water, Save Energy, and
Save Fertilizers”. Hence, “Per drop more crop” is our watchword; each drop
of water can contribute towards producing more crop and hence successful
farming. We have moved in the direction of spending funds to take this
cause further.

In the recent past, when our crops got damaged due to hailstorm, we
increased the compensation enormously. Such an increase has never been
witnessed in the past 60 years. Not only this, earlier if there were any
losses, there was the norm according to which one would be entitled for
compensation only if the losses suffered were at least 50 per cent. We
have brought it down to 30 per cent. Never in the past 60 years was such a
great initiative of helping the farmers taken. Farmers need urea. I would like
to tell once again as to how to fight corruption. “Neem-Coating” is not the
brain child of Modi, rather it is an idea propounded by Scientists and this
idea has not only been brought before my government, it has come before
previous governments as well. In our country, urea worth millions and
billions of rupees is allocated in the names of farmers, but 15, 20 or 25 per
cent of this urea is diverted to the chemical factories as raw material.
Allocated in the names of farmers, this urea is pilfered through the
middlemen. This pilferage of urea cannot be stopped unless we go for cent
per cent “Neem-Coating” of urea. Therefore, irrespective of the burden
caused to the exchequer, we have accomplished the task of doing hundred
per cent “Neem-Coating” of urea. As a result of this, now urea cannot be
used for any purpose other than farming. Now, no chemical factory can
indulge in any kind of pilferage of urea. The farmers will have as much urea
as they need. Since the urea is “Neem Coated”, even if they use 10 per
cent less of urea, their land will be benefitted with the nutritional value it
requires. The farmers of my country will be having a new advantage of urea
- I would suggest to all the farmers that even if by chance someone shows
you urea without “Neem-Coating”, you take it to be unauthorized by the
Government. If someone gives you a yellow powder, don’t even touch it.

Brothers and sisters, India cannot develop till the eastern part of the
country develops. India cannot be said to be developing only on the basis
of the development of the western parts of the country. India will move
ahead only when our eastern Uttar Pradesh becomes prosperous, our
Bihar becomes strong, our West Bengal, Assam, Odisha, North Eastern
regions tread the path of development. These territories of India should
become powerful. And so whether is a matter of infrastructure or of rail
connectivity or of digital connectivity - in all these aspects, we have
focussed on eastern India. This focus has resulted in the proposed laying
of a gas pipe line in this region. Who could have thought that the states
where there was no potable tap water even in kitchen, there we are
working to supply the gas through pipe lines. Four urea fertilizer plants
were shut down in eastern India. Youth of these states were unemployed
and farmers were in distress. We have made new urea policy and we have
also formulated new gas supply policy. This has resulted in revival of
fertilizer plants of eastern centers of Gorakhpur, Barauni, Talcher and
Sindari. Thus we are working to provide employment to the youth and
fertilizers to the farmers.

Brothers and sisters, there is a Government Department for Army soldiers
and for their welfare. In our country farmers are as important as soldiers.
What have we done in sixty years! We have emphasized on the economic
aspect of agriculture. With the intention to have flourishing agriculture and
for agricultural advancement, the concerned ministry of this government
has been named as 'Ministry of Agriculture'.

Brothers and sisters, Agricultural growth is as important as the welfare of
farmers. Only talking about agricultural development is incomplete for rural
life style and for agriculture based livelihood. That will become complete,
when the welfare of the farmer is also linked. Brothers and Sisters, the
Ministry of the Government of India which was earlier known as ""Ministry of
Agriculture"", from now will be known as the ""Ministry of farmer Welfare"" and
in the days to come schemes for the welfare of farmers will also be
formulated alike the schemes for agriculture are prepared and the
Government would make efforts to provide help to the farmers by means of
setting permanent system for the problems that my farmers has to face in
his personal life, the hurdles that he has to go through.

Brothers and sisters, in the coming days I wish to concentrate on an issue.
There has been so many years of independence but even today there are
about eighteen thousand, five hundred such villages in our country, where
electric wires and polls are yet to reach. Eighteen thousand five hundred
villages are deprived of the sun of independence, deprived of the light of
independence, they are deprived of the rays of development of
independence. If we will keep on following the old methods, perhaps it will
take ten more years to electrify these eighteen thousand, five hundred
villages with wires and polls. The country is not ready to wait for ten years.

I took the meeting of government officials and enquired from them about
the timeline. Someone promised to complete the task till 2019, someone
assured to complete it till 2022. Some were hesitant due to dense forests or
snowy hills, and some had apprehension due to inaccessibility of certain
areas. But, it is now the solemn pledge of the ""Team India"" of 1.25 billion
countrymen that the target of providing electric polls, electric wires and
electricity to these 18,500 villages would be achieved within next 1000
days. I urge upon the states to come forward and accept this challenge.
This is not pending in every state, only a few states will have to strive a little
further. I would not like to count the name of such states, as it would be
viewed politically and may attract political comments. Hence, it's better to
avoid it. I, therefore, announce the pledge of the 'Team India' of our 1.25
billion countrymen, from the Red Fort, that electricity would be made
available to 18,500 villages within the next 1000 days, with the help of
states and local bodies.

I have taken up another issue of concern, which is 'Welfare of Farmers'.
Similar issue of grave concern is the under-development of such mining
areas, from where we get mineral resources, such as coal, bauxite and
other minerals. Now, look at the life of people there. They sweat to make
our country rich but that region is not developed and, therefore, we have
formulated a special scheme for the development of the labourers and
farmers of the region from where minerals are extracted and around rupees
six thousand crores will be spent every year on the regions which fall in the
areas of my tribals brothers, located in my tribal areas. Where coal is
found? Coal is found in tribal areas. We have undertaken work to see
development takes place there.

Brother and sisters, our youth power is of import for taking the country
forward in twenty first century and today, I want to declare that if we have to
move ahead in comparison to the whole world, we have to encourage our
youths, we have to provide them opportunities. How our youths become
new entrepreneurs, how our youths become new producers, how a
complete network of start-up by these new entrepreneurs is set up in the
whole country? There should not be any district, any block in Hindustan
where there are not start-up initiated in the coming days. Whether India
cannot dream that India becomes number one in the world of start-up.
Today we are not at that position. Brothers and Sisters, I have to provide
strength to start-up and, therefore, I resolve that in the coming days
""Start-up India"" and ""Stand-up India"" will be there or the future of the
country. And for a bright future of the country ""Stand-up India"" shall be
launched when I want to move forward this job pertaining to ""Start-up
India"", ""Stand-up India"", my brothers and sisters, in our country our bank
officials have done a herculean task, and when you do a good job, my
expectations rise a lot.

My banker friends, my expectations are rising, so please do not get
offended, but I trust you that your subordinate staff is contributing a lot for
the economic advancement of this nation and in future they will continue to
put in further more efforts. I want to assign you a task today. There are 1.25
lakh banking units i.e. 1.25 lakh branches of banks in the country. Today, I
would like to assign a task to these 1.25 lakh branches. This year marks
the 125th anniversary of Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkarji. There are 1.25 lakhs
branches of banks. This is my programme referred to as ""Start-up India"",
under this programme more schemes will be formulated, but every branch
must resolve and in the days to come resolve once again to disburse loans
for start-ups to the tribals in the locality where there is any tribal habitation,
and where there is no tribal habitation, the branch can provide loans to a
dalit or a tribal, give financial support to them and thus enable 1.25 lakh
Dalit entrepreneurs to come up. Let there be tribal entrepreneurs in the
tribal settlements of this country. We can do this, we can give a new
dimension to star-up and secondly whether these one lakh twenty five
thousand branches can formulate a special scheme for women
entrepreneurs? These one lakh twenty five thousand branches should
promote start-up of women entrepreneurs and help them financially. You
will find that within no time, India would see a network of start up, new
entrepreneurs would emerge and they would in-turn provide employment
ranging from one to two to four persons which will transform India's
economic life.

Brothers and sisters, when investment comes to the country, we expect
more manufacturing work and more exports and the finance department of
the Government offer new schemes to such investors. It has its own
significance and this should continue. But today I have a new idea that the
investment coming to our country in the manufacturing sector should be
offered assistance based on new parameters and one of them shall be that
an investor who comes with an enterprise which provides employment to
maximum persons would be eligible for a different kind of economic
package.

The Government would now formulate new schemes for new units linking it
with employment and assistance of Government. We want to stress upon
the growth of employment opportunities in the country. We have reached
far beyond in the direction of fulfilling the dreams of Skill India and Digital
India. Brothers and sisters, one area of corruption is job. The poorest of the
poor man aspires for his son's job and we have seen that whenever a youth
receives a call for an interview for a job, may be that is for interview in
railway, for a teacher, for a peon, for a driver, he began to think about who
he should approach for recommendation? Even his widow mother begin to
brood over the issue. why? That is because in our country justice and
injustice are mostly decided on the basis of interview rather than the basis
of merit and it is said that the person has failed in the interview. I have not
seen any such psychologist till now, who are capable of assessing a
person on the basis of interviewing him just for two minutes.

Brothers and sisters, I have been thinking over it for many days that
whether it is necessary to appear for an interview for a son of a poor
mother, for a less educated person who is in need of petty jobs? Whether
he can't get any job without an interview? Whether on the basis of his
mark-sheet online-- it should be decided on the basis of online mark sheet
that if we require five hundred people, than who should be those initial five
hundred people, then who should be initial two thousand people. Of course,
where the testing of physical fitness is required, the norms and system
could vary there. Personality and experience of a candidate matters only
for jobs of senior ranks, but it is painful to see that candidates even from
the states of Nagaland and Mizoram rush to Mumbai to appear in exams
for junior-level posts in Railways. I have to combat this problem. I impress
upon the state governments and my colleagues of the Government to
discontinue the stage of interview for junior-level posts as soon as possible.
Such jobs should be given just on the basis of merit. This would help in
curbing corruption, which hurts the poor people, and it would ease out their
problem. It is my appeal to endeavour towards this goal.

My countrymen enjoy sound sleep. But, if our 1.25 billion countrymen are
able to enjoy their undisturbed sleep, it is only due to ever-readiness of our
jawans to sacrifice themselves, who are posted at the borders. No country
can under-evaluate the importance of its armed forces. For the 'Team India'
of 1.25 billion countrymen, each and every soldier or jawan is the strength
of the nation, wealth of the nation and force of the nation. Many successive
governments have come and gone over the years. The issue of ""One Rank
One Pension"" has come before every government, each one has
considered its proposal, and each and every government has made
promises on it, but the problem is still pending to be resolved.

After my assuming office as Prime Minister I have not been able to do this
by now. Today, I am again assuring all the service personnel and this is not
being said by one man, I am saying this on behalf of One hundred and
twenty five crores people of ""Team India"". I am saying this under the
Tricolour from the ramparts of the Red Fort. I say to service personnel, we
have accepted ""One Rank One Pension"" in principle but talks are going on
with its organizations. Talks have reached at the final stage and we want
that all get justice keeping in view the development of whole country. We
have to find the solution of this problem in the light of above context which
is lingering on from 20-25 years. I believe that the trust in which talks are
being held, some positive result will come out of it. And, therefore, I again
assure that this Government has accepted ""One Rank One Pension"" in
principle. How it is implemented in view of its nitty-gritty situation, we are
taking the talks forward by engaging with its stakeholders.

Brothers and sisters, India is completing 75 years of its independence in
2022. We have not to sit idle after celebrating 75 years of India's
independence on 15th August, 2022. Today itself, on this 15th August, let
we have a resolution for the 15th August, 2022 that 6 lakhs villages of
India, each village must decide and resolve that by 2022, we will be able to
overcome problem in every village. My 1.25 billion countrymen and we, in
our lives, take a resolution for the 2022, the 75 years of Independence of
India. Every citizen take a resolution that I will perform this task for the well
being of the country and betterment of the society. Once my 1.25 billion
fellow countrymen will move forward with a resolution, then by the dawn of
15th August 2022, when the souls of soldiers who laid down their lives for
the freedom will see that the country might have fulfilled 1.25 billion
resolutions, 6 lakh villages might have realized their dreams. Cities,
Metropolitan cities, every department of the government, every unit of the
government should take a resolution and get to work. And there should not
be any literature, there should not be any programme wherein 15th August
2022 is not re-iterated, where resolution for the 75th years of Independence
is not re-iterated. A momentum need to be created. Brothers and Sisters
the movement for freedom lasted several decades. Nevertheless the
freedom was in the air only, then someone raised the issue of freedom in
the year 1910, again in the year 1920 and again and again in the year 1930
and so on. The issue was re-iterated for decades, only then we attained
freedom. In order to build a self confident, magnificent and prosperous
India we have to make our country competent, prosperous and healthy. We
have to fulfill the dream of a well cultured India, build self confident India
and excellent India. No poor person in this country should remain without
shelter by 2022. We have to succeed in providing round the clock
electricity. Our farmer should be capable, our worker should be satisfied,
our women should be empowered, our youth should be self dependent, our
elderly should be hail and hearty and our poor should be prosperous. No
one should remain backward in our society and everyone should enjoy
equal rights and entire Indian society should reel in harmony. With this
dream once again I convey my heartiest congratulation to 1.25 billion
countrymen on this pious festival of freedom with preparedness to move
forward in a specific role for 75th anniversary of independence. Repeat me
with full strength:-

Bharat Mata Ki Jai,Bharat Mata Ki Jai,Bharat Mata Ki Jai.

Vande Mataram, Vande Mataram, Vande Mataram.

Jai Hind, Jai Hind, Jai Hind!"
2014,Narendra Modi,BJP,NA,Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi addressed the Nation from the ramparts of the Red Fort on the 68th Independence Day. Following is the English rendering of the Prime Minister’s address on the occasion:-,pmindia.gov.in,http://www.pmindia.gov.in/en/news_updates/text-of-pms-address-in-hindi-to-the-nation-from-the-ramparts-of-the-red-fort-on-the-68th-independence-day/?comment=disable,"My dear countrymen,

Today, all Indians in the country and also abroad are celebrating the
festival of independence. On this day of sacred festival of independence,
the prime servant of India extends greetings to all dear countrymen.

I am present amidst you not as the Prime Minister, but as the Prime
Servant. The freedom struggle was fought for so many years, so many
generations laid down their lives, innumerable people sacrificed their lives
and youth, spent their entire lives behind bars. Today, I pay my respect,
greetings and homage to all those who laid their lives for the country's
independence.

I also pay my respects to the crores of citizens of this country on the pious
occasion of India's independence, and recall all those martyrs who had laid
down their lives in India's struggle for freedom. The day of independence is
a festival when we take a solemn pledge of working for the welfare of
mother India, and also for the welfare of the poor, oppressed, dalits, the
exploited & the backward people of our country.

My dear countrymen, a national festival is an occasion to refine and rebuild
the national character. This National festival inspires us to resolve
ourselves to lead a life where our character gets refined further, to dedicate
ourselves to the nation and our every activity is linked to the interest of the
nation and only then this festival of freedom can be a festival of inspiration
to take India to newer heights.

My dear countrymen, this nation has neither been built by political leaders
nor by rulers nor by governments. This nation has been built by our
farmers, our workers, our mothers and sisters, our youth. The country has
reached here today because of generation to generation rigours
undertaken by our sages, our saints, our maestros, our teachers, our
scientists and social workers. These great people and these great
generations, who had worked for the country throughout their lives, deserve
our deepest respect. This is the beauty of India's Constitution, this is its
capability which has made it possible that today a boy from small town, a
poor family has got the opportunity to pay homage to the tri-colour of India
at the ramparts of Lal Quila (Red Fort). This is the strength of India's
democracy. This is an invaluable legacy which we have inherited from our
architects of the constitution. I pay my respects to those architects of the
constitution of India today.

Brothers and sisters, today if we have reached here after independence, it
is because of the contribution of all the Prime Ministers, all the
governments and even the governments of all the States. I want to express
my feelings of respect and gratitude to all those previous governments and
ex-Prime Ministers who have endeavoured to take our present day India to
such heights and who have added to the country's glory.

This country has been built on such foundation of ancient cultural heritage,
where we were told of only one mantra during Vedic period, which is
indicative of our work culture, which we have learnt, we have memorized –
“Sangachchhdhvam Samvadadhvam sam wo manansi jaanataam.” We
walk together, we move together, we think together, we resolve together
and together we take this country forward. Having imbibed this basic
mantra, 125 crores of countrymen have taken the nation forward.
Yesterday only the first Parliamentary Session of the new Government had
concluded. Today, I can proudly say that the Session of Parliament reflects
our thinking and it is a reflection of our intentions. We are not for moving
forward on the basis of majority, we are not interested to move forward by
virtue of majority. We want to move ahead on the basis of strong
consensus. “Sangachhadhwam” and, therefore, the nation has witnessed
the entire Session of Parliament. Having taken all the Parties and
Opposition along while working shoulder to shoulder, we achieved an
unprecedented success and the credit for this does not go to the Prime
Minister alone, the credit does not go to the people sitting in the
Government, the credit for this goes to the Opposition also, the credit goes
to all the leaders of Opposition too and also all the Members from
Opposition. From the ramparts of Red Fort, quite proudly I salute all the
Members of Parliament, I also salute all the Political Parties and by virtue of
their strong support, we could take some important decisions intended to
take the nation forward and yesterday the Session of Parliament had
concluded.

Brothers and sisters, I am an outsider for Delhi, I am not a native of Delhi. I
have no idea about the administration and working of this place. I have
been quite isolated from the elite class of this place but during the last two
months while being an outsider, I had an insider view and I was astonished.
It is not a political platform, rather it is a platform of a national policy and,
therefore, my views should not be evaluated from a political perspective. I
have already said, I salute all the ex-Prime Ministers and earlier
governments who have brought the country thus far. But I am going to say
something else and it may not be seen from political point of view. When I
came to Delhi and noticed an insider view, I felt what it was and I was
surprised to see it. It seemed as if dozens of separate governments are
running at the same time in one main government. It appeared that
everyone has its own fiefdom. I could observe disunity and conflict among
them. One department is taking on the other department and taking on to
the extent that two departments of the same government are fighting
against each other by approaching Supreme Court.This disunity, this
conflict among people of the same country! How come we can take the
country forward? And that is why I have started making efforts for razing
those walls; I have started making efforts at making the Government, not
an assembled entity, but an organic unity, an organic entity, a harmonious
whole- with one aim, one mind, one direction, one energy. Let's resolve to
steer the country to one destination. We have it in us to move in that
direction. A few days back…Nowadays newspapers are full of news that
Modiji's Government has come, officers are reaching office on time, offices
open in time, and people get there in time. I observed that India's National
newspapers, TV media were carrying these news items prominently. As the
Head of the Government I could have derived pleasure in the fact that
everything started going on time, cleanliness got the attention, but I was not
taking pleasure, I was feeling pained. That thing, I want to tell today in
public. And why, because if government officers arrive office in time, does
that make a news? And if that makes news, it shows how low we have
fallen. It becomes a proof of that, and that's how, brothers and sisters, the
governments have run? Today in the face of global competition, when we
have to realize the dreams of millions of Indians, the country cannot run on
the lines of ” it happens”, ” it goes”. In order to fulfil the aspirations of
masses, we have to sharpen the tool called the Government machinery, we
have to make it keen, more dynamic, and it is in this direction that we are
working. My countrymen, it's not long since I have come from outside Delhi,
but I give you an assurance that the people in the Government are very
capable – from the peon to the Cabinet Secretary, everybody is capable,
everybody has a power, they have experience. I want to awaken that
power, I want to unite that power and want to accelerate the pace of the
welfare of nation through that power and I shall definitely do it. I want to
assure the countrymen that we will achieve that, we will definitely do that. I
could not say this on 16th May, but today after my experience of two-two
and half months, keeping the tricolor as witness, I am saying on 15th of
August that it is possible, it will be achieved.

Brothers and sisters, time has come to give a serious thought to the fact
that whether we have a duty to create India of the dreams of those great
people who gave us freedom, whether we have a national character?

Brothers and sisters, can someone please tell me as to whether he or she
has ever introspected in the evening after a full day's work as to whether
his or her acts have helped the poor of the country or not, whether his or
her actions have resulted in safeguarding the interest of the country or not,
whether the actions have been directed in country's welfare or not?
Whether it should not be the motto of one and a quarter billion countrymen
that every step in life should be in the country's interests? Unfortunately, we
have an environment today wherein if you approach anyone with some
work, he begins by saying “what does it mean for me?” He begins by
saying “what does it involve for me?” and when he come to know that it
does not entail any benefit for him, immediately he says “why should I
bother?” we have to rise above the feelings of “what does it mean for me”
and “why should I bother”. Everything is not for self interest only. There are
certain things which are meant for the country and we have to refine this
national character. We have to rise above the feelings of “why should I
bother” and “what does it mean for me” and instead we have to think that “I
am for nation's interest and in this field, I am going to lead”. We have to
inculcate this sentiment.

Brothers and sisters, when we hear about the incidents of rape, we hang
our heads in shame. People come out with different arguments, someone
indulges in psycho analysis, but brothers and sisters, today from this
platform, I want to ask those parents, I want to ask every parent that you
have a daughter of 10 or 12 years age, you are always on the alert, every
now and then you keep on asking where are you going, when would you
come back, inform immediately after you reach. Parents ask their
daughters hundreds of questions, but have any parents ever dared to ask
their son as to where he is going, why he is going out, who his friends are.
After all, a rapist is also somebody's son. He also has parents. As parents,
have we ever asked our son as to what he is doing and where he is going.
If every parent decides to impose as many restrictions on the sons as have
been imposed on our daughters, try to do this with your sons, try to ask
such questions of them.

My dear brothers and sisters, the law will take its own course, strict action
will be taken, but as a member of the society, as parents, we also have
some responsibilities. If somebody tells me that those who have taken guns
on their shoulders and kill innocent people are maoists, are terrorists, but
they are also somebody's children. I would like to ask of such parents if
they had ever asked their children as to why they were taking a wrong path.
Every parent must take this responsibility, he must know that his misguided
son is bent on killing innocent people. He is not able to serve himself nor
his family nor the country. I want to say to those youngsters who have
chosen the path of violence that whatever they are and wherever they are,
it is all because of mother India only that they have got it. Whoever you are
it is all because of your parents. I want to ask you to think how green, how
beautiful and how beneficial this earth can become if you shoulder the
plough instead of the gun which spills blood on this land. How long shall we
have bloodshed on this land, how long shall we take the lives of the
innocent people and what have we got after all this? The path of violence
has not yielded anything to us.

Brothers and sisters, I had gone to Nepal recently. There I said something
publicly to draw the attention of the whole world. There was a time when
the Emperor Ashoka who had chosen the path of wars, got converted to
the path of Buddha at the sight of violence. There was a time in Nepal
when their youngsters had opted for the path of violence but today I
witness that the same youngsters are waiting for their constitution. The
same people associated with them are framing the constitution. And I
further said that if Nepal could present the best example of moving from the
weapons to the books then it could provide inspiration to the youngsters in
the world to abandon the path of violence.

Brothers and sisters, If Nepal, land of Buddha, can give message to the
world then why can't India too do the same? So it's the call of the hour that
we renounce the path of violence and take the path of brotherhood.

Brothers and sisters, for one reason or the other, we have had communal
tensions for ages. This led to the division of the country. Even after
Independence, we have had to face the poison of casteism and
communalism. How long these evils will continue? Whom does it benefit?
We have had enough of fights, many have been killed. Friends, look behind
and you will find that nobody has benefited from it. Except casting a slur on
Mother India, we have done nothing. Therefore, I appeal to all those people
that whether it is the poison of casteism, communalism, regionalism,
discrimination on social and economic basis, all these are obstacles in our
way forward. Let's resolve for once in our hearts, let's put a moratorium on
all such activities for ten years, we shall march ahead to a society which
will be free from all such tensions. And you will see that how much strength
we get from peace, unity, goodwill and brotherhood. Let's experiment it for
once.

My dear countrymen, believe in my words, I do assure you. Shun all the
sins committed so far, give up that way, follow the way of goodwill and
brotherhood, and let's resolve to take the country forward. I believe we can
do that.

With advancement of science, brothers and sisters, we have a rising feeling
of modernity in our mind, but what do we do? Have we ever thought what
the sex ratio in the country is like? 940 girls are born against per thousand
boys. Who is causing this imbalance in the society? Certainly not God. I
request the doctors not to kill the girl growing in the womb of a mother just
to line their own pockets. I advise mothers and sisters not to sacrifice
daughters in the hope of son. Sometimes mother-father feel tempted to
have son in the hope of supporting them in old age. I am a person who has
worked in public life. I have come across families with five sons, each
having bungalows, access to fleet of cars, but parents are forced to live in
old-age homes, Vriddhashrams. I have seen such families. I have also
seen families with only daughter as progeny, that daughter sacrifices her
dreams, doesn't get married, and spends entire life in taking care of old
parents. This disparity points to female foeticide and the polluted and
tainted mind the 21st century has. We will have to liberate from it, and that
is message to us of this Freedom festival.

Recently Commonwealth Games were organized. Indian sportspersons
brought glory to the country. Nearly 64 of our sportspersons won. Our
sportspersons brought 64 medals. But of them 29 are girls. Let's feel proud
and clap for them. Girls also contribute to India's fame and glory. Let's
recognise it. Let's take them along, shoulder to shoulder. This way we can
get over the evils that have crept in social life. Therefore, brothers and
sisters, we have to proceed in that direction as a social and national
character. Brothers and Sisters, Development is the only way forward for
the country. Good governance is the only way. There are only these two
tracks to take the country forward – good governance and development, we
can move forward only by taking them with us. We wish to move forward
with the intent of taking them with us. When I talk of good governance, you
tell me, when I ask a person in private job, he tells that he does the job;
when you ask the same from a person in government job, he says that I do
the service. Both earn, but for one it is job while for the other it is service. I
ask a question from all brothers and sisters in government service, whether
the word “Service” has not lost its strength, its identity? Persons in
government service are not doing “job”, they are doing “service”. We have
to revive this feeling, we have to take this feeling forward as a national
character, we have to move forward in this direction.

Brothers and Sisters, whether the citizens of the country should take steps
for the welfare of the nation or not? You imagine, if this 125 crores of
countrymen move one step forward, then the country moves 125 crore
steps forward. The meaning of democracy is not just limited to electing a
government, but its meaning is that 125 crore of citizens work together
joining shoulder with the government to fulfill hopes and aspirations of the
country, this is the meaning of democracy. We have to create partnership
with the people. We have to proceed under Public-Private Partnership. We
have to proceed along with the participation of the people. But, please tell
me why our farmers commit suicide? A farmer takes loan from the
moneylender, but fails to repay his loans. He takes loan for the wedding of
his daughter, but fails to repay. He will have to suffer hardships during his
whole life. He chooses to commit suicide. Who will save the poor families of
such farmers?

Brothers and sisters, I have come here with a pledge to launch a scheme
on this festival of Freedom. It will be called “Pradhanmantri Jan-Dhan
Yojana”. I wish to connect the poorest citizens of the country with the
facility of bank accounts through this yojana. There are millions of families
who have mobile phones but no bank accounts. We have to change this
scenario. Economic resources of the country should be utilized for the
well-being of the poor. The change will commence from this point. This
yojana will open the window. Therefore, an account holder under
“Pradhanmantri Jan-Dhan Yojana” will be given a debit card. An insurance
of One Lakh Rupees will be guaranteed with that debit card for each poor
family, so that such families are covered with the insurance of One Lakh
Rupees in case of any crisis in their lives.

My brothers and sisters, it is a country of young people. The 65 percent
population of the country happens to be under the age of 35 years. Our
country has the largest number of youths in the world. Have we ever
thought of deriving an advantage out of it? Today, the world needs a skilled
workforce. Today, India also needs a skilled workforce. At times, we look
for a good driver but he is not available, we look for a plumber, but he is not
available. If we need a good cook, he is not available. We have young
people, they are unemployed but the kind of young people we seek for are
not available. If we have to promote the development of our country then
our mission has to be “skill development” and “skilled India”. Millions and
Millions of Indian youth should go for acquisition of skills and there should
be a network across the country for this and not the archaic systems. They
should acquire the skills which could contribute towards making India a
modern country. Whenever they go to any country in the world, their skills
must be appreciated and we want to go for a two pronged development. I
also want to create a pool of young people who are able to create jobs and
the ones who are not capable of creating jobs and do not have the
opportunities, they must be in a position to face their counterparts in any
corner of the world while keeping their heads high by virtue of their hard
work and their dexterity of hands and win the hearts of people around the
world through their skills. We want to go for the capacity building of such
young people. My brothers and sisters, having taken a resolve to enhance
the skill development at a highly rapid pace, I want to accomplish this.

Brothers and sisters, the world has undergone a change. My dear
countrymen, the world has changed. Now India can not decide its future by
remaining isolated and sitting alone in a corner. The economics of the
world have changed and, therefore, we will have to act accordingly.
Government have taken many decisions recently, made some
announcements in the budget and I call upon the world and call upon the
Indians spread world over that if we have to provide more and more
employment to the youth, we will have to promote manufacturing sector. If
we have to develop a balance between imports and exports, we will have to
strengthen manufacturing sector. If we have to put in use the education, the
capability of the youth, we will have to go for manufacturing sector and for
this Hindustan also will have to lend its full strength, but we also invite
world powers. Therefore I want to appeal all the people world over, from
the ramparts of the Red Fort, “Come, make in India”, “Come, manufacture
in India”. Sell in any country of the world but manufacture here. We have
got skill, talent, discipline, and determination to do something. We want to
give the world an favourable opportunity that come here, “Come, Make in
India” and we will say to the world, from electrical to electronics, “Come,
Make in India”, from automobiles to agro value addition “Come, Make in
India”, paper or plastic, “Come, Make in India”, satellite or submarine
“Come, Make in India”. Our country is powerful. Come, I am giving you an
invitation.

Brothers and sisters, I want to call upon the youth of the country,
particularly the small people engaged in the industrial sector. I want to call
upon the youth working in the field of technical education in the country. As
I say to the world “Come, Make in India”, I say to the youth of the country –
it should be our dream that this message reaches every corner of the
world, “Made in India”. This should be our dream. Whether, to serve the
country, is it necessary for the youth of the country to be hanged like
Bhagat Singh? Brothers and sisters, Lal Bahadur Shastri had given the
slogan “Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan”. A soldier sacrifices himself at the border and
protects Mother India. Similarly, a farmer serves Mother India by filling the
godowns with grains. This is also nation's service. Filling the granary is the
biggest nation's service that a farmer provides. That is why Lal Bahadur
Shashtri had given the slogan of “Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan”.

Brothers and Sisters, I would like to pose a question to my youngsters as to
why despite them, we are forced to import even the smallest of things? My
country's youth can resolve it, they should conduct research, try to find out
as to what type of items are imported by India and then each one should
resolve that, through may be micro or small industries only, he would
manufacture at least one such item so that we need not import the same in
future. We should even advance to a situation wherein we are able to
export such items. If each one of our millions of youngsters resolves to
manufacture at least one such item, India can become a net exporter of
goods. I, therefore, urge upon the youth, in particular our small
entrepreneurs that they would never compromise, at least on two counts.
First, zero defect and, second again zero effect. We should manufacture
goods in such a way that they carry zero defect, that our exported goods
are never returned to us. We should manufacture goods with zero effect
that they should not have a negative impact on the environment. If we
march ahead with the dream of zero defect in the manufacturing sector
then, my brothers and sisters, I am confident that we would be able to
achieve our goals.

Brothers and sisters, the youth of India has completely transformed the
identity of India in the world. Earlier, in what manner did the world know our
country? Till only 25-30 years back, if not more, there were many people in
the world who thought that India was a country of snake charmers, it was a
country which practiced in black magic. The real identity of India had not
reached the world, but my dear brothers and sisters, our youngsters,
20-22-23 years old youngsters have mesmerized the whole world with their
skills in computers. Our young I.T. professionals have given a new path of
making a new identity of India. If our country has this strength, can we think
something about the country? Our dream is, therefore, of “Digital India”.
When I talk of “Digital India”, I don't speak of the elite, it is for the poor
people. You can imagine what a quality education the children in villages
will get, if all the villages of India are connected with Broadband
Connectivity and if we are able to give long distance education to the
schools in every remote corner of the villages. If we create a network of
telemedicine in the places where there is a shortage of doctors, we can
have a clear guideline of the way in which health facilities have to be
provided to the poor people living in those areas. The citizens of India have
mobile phones in their hands, they have mobile connectivity, but can we
walk in the direction of mobile governance? We have to move in a direction
where every poor person is able to operate his bank account from his
mobile, is able to demand various things from the government, can submit
applications, can conduct all his business, while on the move, through
mobile governance and if this has to be done, we have to move towards
“digital India” and if we have to move towards “digital India” then we have a
dream. Today we are importing electronic goods on a large scale. Friends,
you will be surprised that we are bringing in these televisions, mobile
phones, i-pads and all these electronic goods. It is a necessity to import
petroleum products, oil, diesel and petrol. Second to this is the import of
our electronic goods. If we move ahead with the dream of “digital India” to
manufacture electronic goods and become self reliant at least there, how
big can be the benefit for the treasury! Therefore, e-governance is what we
need to take this idea of “digital India” forward. E-governance is easy
governance, effective governance and also economic governance.
E-governance paves the way for good governance. There was a time when
we used to say that the railways provided connectivity to the country. That
was it. I say that today it is IT that has the potential to connect each and
every citizen of the country and that is why we want to realise the mantra of
unity with the help of “digital India”.

Brothers and sisters, if we move ahead with all this then I believe that a
“digital India” will have the potential to stand with the world on equal
footing. Our youth have that capability, it is an opportunity for them.

Brothers and sisters, we want to promote tourism. Tourism provides
employment to the poorest of the poor. Gram seller earns something,
auto-rickshaw driver earns something, pakoda seller earns something and
tea seller also earns something. When there is talk of tea seller, I feel a
sense of belongingness. Tourism provide employment to the poorest of the
poor. But there is a big obstacle in promoting tourism and in our national
character and that is – the filthiness all around us. Whether after
independence, after so many years of independence, when we stand at the
threshold of one and half decade of 21st century, we still want to live in
filthiness? The first work I started here after formation of Government is of
cleanliness. People wondered whether it is a work of a Prime Minister?
People may feel that it is a trivial work for a Prime Minister but for me this a
big work. Cleanliness is very big work. Whether our country can not be
clean? If one hundred and twenty five crore countrymen decide that they
will never spread filthiness, which power in the world has ability to spread
filthiness in our cities and villages? Can't we resolve this much?

Brothers and sisters it will be 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in
2019. How do we celebrate 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi?
Mahatma Gandhi, who gave us freedom, who brought so much honour to
such a big country in the world, what do we give to Mahatma Gandhi?
Brothers and Sisters, Mahatma Gandhi had cleanliness and sanitation
closest to his heart. Whether we resolve not to leave a speck of dirt in our
village, city, street, area, school, temple, hospital, and what have you, by
2019 when we celebrate 150th anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi? This
happens not just with the Government, but with public participation. That's
why we have to do it together.

Brother and Sisters, we are living in 21st century. Has it ever pained us that
our mothers and sisters have to defecate in open? Whether dignity of
women is not our collective responsibility? The poor womenfolk of the
village wait for the night; until darkness descends, they can't go out to
defecate. What bodily torture they must be feeling, how many diseases that
act might engender. Can't we just make arrangements for toilets for the
dignity of our mothers and sisters? Brothers and Sisters, somebody might
feel that a big festival like 15th August is an occasion to talk big. Brothers
and Sisters, talking big has its importance, making announcements too has
importance, but sometimes announcements raise hopes and when the
hopes are not fulfilled, the society sinks into a state of despondency. That's
why are in favour of telling those things, which we can fulfil just within our
sight. Brothers and sisters, you must be getting shocked to hear the Prime
Minister speaking of cleanliness and the need to build toilets from the
ramparts of the Red Fort. Brothers and sisters, I do not know how my
speech is going to be criticised and how will people take it. But this is my
heartfelt conviction. I come from a poor family, I have seen poverty. The
poor need respect and it begins with cleanliness. I, therefore, have to
launch a “clean India” campaign from 2nd October this year and carry it
forward in 4 years. I want to make a beginning today itself and that is – all
schools in the country should have toilets with separate toilets for girls.
Only then our daughters will not be compelled to leave schools midway.
Our parliamentarians utilizing MPLAD fund are there. I appeal to them to
spend it for constructing toilets in schools for a year. The government
should utilise its budget on providing toilets. I call upon the corporate sector
also to give priority to the provision of toilets in schools with your
expenditure under Corporate Social Responsibility. This target should be
finished within one year with the help of state governments and on the next
15th August, we should be in a firm position to announce that there is no
school in India without separate toilets for boys and girls.
Brothers and sisters, if we proceed with the dreams, we are in a position to
realise them. Today, I wish to tell one more specific thing. It has its own
importance to discuss the matters and express the views of nation's
interest. However, our Members of Parliament do not get opportunity
though they are willing to do something. They can express themselves,
write to the government, agitate, give memoranda. Still they do not get
opportunity to do something on their own. Today I have come to you with a
new idea. We are running so many schemes in the name of the Prime
Minister in our country, there are numerous schemes in the name of
various leaders. However, today I am going to announce a scheme on
behalf of the Member of Parliament- “Sansad Aadarsh Gram Yojana”. We
shall fix some parameters. I urge upon the Members of Parliament to select
any one of the villages having population of three to five thousand in your
constituency. The parameters will be according to the time, space and
situation of that locality. It will include the conditions of health, cleanliness,
atmosphere, greenery, cordiality etc. On the basis of those parameters,
each of our MPs should make one village of his or her constituency a
Model Village by 2016. Can't we do at least this? Shouldn't we do this? If
we have to build a nation, we should start from the village. Make a Model
Village. The reason of fixing this target for 2016 is that it is a new scheme.
It takes time to formulate a scheme and then to implement it. After 2016,
select two more villages for this purpose, before we go for the General
Elections in 2019. And after 2019, each Member of Parliament, during
his/her tenure of 5 years must establish at-least five model villages in
his/her area. I also call upon the Members of Parliament from urban areas
to adopt one village of their choice. I also urge upon the Members of
Parliament from Rajya Sabha to adopt one of the villages. If we provide
one model village in each district of India then the surrounding villages shall
be automatically inspired to follow that model. Let us establish a model
village, let us establish a village well equipped with all systems and
facilities. The birth anniversary of Jai Prakash Narayan Ji happens to be on
11th October. On 11th October, the occasion of birth anniversary of Jai
Prakash Narayan Ji, I will present a complete blueprint of “Sānsad Adharsh
Grām Yojana” (Members of Parliament Model Village Scheme) before all
Members of Parliament and State Governments, and I urge upon State
Governments also that as per the feasibility in their respective states, all
the Members of Legislative Assembly resolve to establish a model village.
You can imagine all the Members of Legislative Assembly and all the
Members of Parliament in the country establishing a model village. All of a
sudden, there would be a model village in each block of India which could
inspire us to transform the amenities in rural areas and could give us a new
direction and, therefore, we want to move ahead under this “Sānsad
Adarsh Grām Yojana”.

My dear brothers and sisters, ever since our government has taken charge,
there has been a discussion in the newspapers, on T.V. channels as to
what would happen to Planning Commission. I believe that when Planning
Commission was constituted, it was done on the basis of the circumstances
and the needs of those times. In recent years, Planning Commission has
contributed to the growth of the country in its own way. I respect that, I am
proud of that, but the prevalent situation in the country is different, global
scenario has also changed, governments are no longer the centre of
economic activities, the scope of such activities has broadened. State
governments have been at the center of development and I consider this a
good indication. If we have to take India forward, it can happen only by
taking the states forward. India's federal structure is more important today
than in the last 60 years. To strengthen our federal structure, to make our
federal structure vibrant, to take our federal structure as a heritage of
development, a team of Chief Minister and Prime Minister should be there,
a joint team of the Centre and the states should move forward, then to do
this job, we will have to think about giving the Planning Commission a look.
So, I am saying from the rampart of the Red Fort that it is a very old system
and it will have to be rejuvenated, it will have to be changed a lot.
Sometimes it costs more to repair the old house, but, it gives us no
satisfaction. Thereafter, we have a feeling that it would be better to
construct a new house altogether and therefore within a short period, we
will replace the planning commission with a new institution having a new
design and structure, a new body, a new soul, a new thinking, a new
direction, a new faith towards forging a new direction to lead the country
based on creative thinking, public-private partnership, optimum utilization of
resources, utilization of youth power of the nation, to promote the
aspirations of state governments seeking development, to empower the
state governments and to empower the federal structure. Very shortly, we
are about to move in a direction when this institute would be functioning in
place of Planning Commission.

Brothers and sisters, today, on 15th August, we also have the birth
anniversary of Maharishi Aurobindo. Maharishi Aurobindo, being a rebel,
moved on to achieve the status of a Yoga Guru. With regard to the destiny
of India, he remarked, “I have a faith that the divine power and spiritual
heritage of India will play an important role towards the welfare of the
world.” Such sentiments were echoed by Maharishi Arvind. I strongly
believe in the words of legends. I have great faith in the statements made
by ascetics, sages & saints and that’s why today at the ramparts of Lal
Quila I am reminded of the words of Swami Viveknanda. He had said – “I
can see before my eyes Mother India awakening once again. My Mother
India would be seated as the World Guru. Every Indian would render
service towards welfare of humanity. This legacy of India would be useful
for the welfare of the world”. These words were spoken by Swami
Viveknanda ji in his own style. Friends, the words of Viveknanda ji can
never be untrue. The words of Viveknanda ji, his dream of seeing India
ensconced as World Guru, his vision, it is incumbent upon us to realize that
dream. This capable country, blessed with natural bounty, this country of
youth can do much for the world in the coming days.

Brothers and sisters, our foreign policy is a much talked about issue. I
clearly believe that India's foreign policy can be multi-dimensional. But
there is an important issue to which I want to draw your attention that the
way we fought for freedom, we fought together, we were not separate at
that time. We were together. Which was the government with us? What
were the weapons available to us? There was a Gandhi, a Sardar and
lakhs of freedom fighters and such a huge empire. Didn't we win in the
struggle of freedom against that empire? Did we not defeat the foreign
powers? Did we not force them to leave India? We were the ones, they
were our ancestors only who showed this might. If the people of India could
remove such a big empire without the power of the government, without
weapons and even without resources, then friends, it is the need of the
hour to eradicate poverty, can we not overcome poverty? Can we not
defeat poverty? My 125 crore dear countrymen, let us resolve to eradicate
poverty, to win against it. Let us move with the dream of poverty eradication
from India. Our neighbouring countries are also faced with the same
problem. Why not get together with all the SAARC nations to plan out the
fight against poverty? Let's fight together and defeat poverty. Let us see
at-least for once as to how wonderful is the feeling of being alive instead of
killing and getting killed. This is the land where incidents from Siddharth's
life happened. One bird was shot with an arrow by one brother and the
other took out that arrow to save it. They went to mother- whose bird,
whose swan? Whether killer's or saviour's, they asked of mother. The
mother replied, saviour's. The saviour has more power than the killer and
that makes him Buddha in future. And that's why I seek cooperation from
neighbouring countries for fighting against poverty in concert and cooperate
with them, so that together with SAARC countries we can create our
importance and emerge as a power in the world. It is imperative that we
work together with a dream to win a fight against poverty, shoulder to
shoulder. I went to Bhutan, Nepal, all the dignitaries from SAARC countries
took part in oath-taking ceremony; this marked a good beginning. This will
definitely yield good results, it is my belief and this thinking of India, in the
country and the world, that we want to do well to the countrymen and be
useful for the welfare of the world, India wants such a hand to be extended.
We are trying to move forward with these dreams to achieve them.

Brothers and Sisters, today on 15th August we will resolve to do something
for the country. Let's be useful for the country, we will move ahead with a
resolve to take the country forward, and I assure you, Brothers and Sisters,
as well as my colleagues in the Government, that if you work for 12 hours, I
will do so for 13 hours. If you work for 14 hours, I will do for 15 hours. Why?
Because I'm amidst you not as a Prime Minister, but as the first servant. I
have formed the Government not as a ruler, but as a servant. Brothers and
sisters, I assure that this country has a destiny. It is destined to work for the
welfare of the world, it was said by Vivekanand ji. India is born, this
Hindustan is born in order to achieve this destiny. One hundred and twenty
five crore countrymen have to move forward wholeheartedly for the welfare
of the nation.

Once again I feel proud of the devotion, the sacrifices of the security forces
of the country, para-military forces of the country, all the security forces of
the country to protect Mother India. I say to the countrymen, “रा याम,
जा याम ् वयम ्”, “Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty”. The army is vigilant,
we should also be vigilant and the country scales new heights, we have to
move forward with this resolution. Speak loudly with me with full force –

Bharat mata ki jai, bharat mata ki jai, bharat mata ki jai.

Jai Hind, Jai Hind, Jai Hind.

Vande Mataram, Vande Mataram, Vande Mataram!"
2013,Manmohan Singh,INC,NA,"Prime Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh, addressed the Nation from the ramparts of the Red Fort today on the occasion of Independence Day. Following is the English rendering of the Prime Minister’s address in Hindi:,",PMO Archive,http://archivepmo.nic.in/drmanmohansingh/content_print.php?nodeid=1336&nodetype=2,"My dear fellow-citizens,

Brothers, sisters and dear children,

I greet you all on this Independence Day.

Today is certainly a day of joy for us. But on this celebration of
independence we also feel pain in our hearts that our brothers and sisters
in Uttarakhand had to face devastation about two months back. Our
deepest sympathies are with all the families that suffered loss of life or
property. I want to assure the people of Uttarakhand today that the whole
country stands with them in this moment of crisis. Our government is
working with all the resources at its command to rehabilitate those whose
houses have been destroyed and rebuild damaged infrastructure.

Our army, paramilitary forces and numerous officers and staff of the
Central and State governments worked in difficult conditions in partnership
with the common people to perform an outstanding task in providing relief
to those who were stranded. We especially pay homage to the officers and
men of the Air Force, ITBP and NDRF who sacrificed their lives to save
others.

We are also deeply pained that we lost the submarine, INS Sindurakshak in
an accident yesterday. Eighteen brave sailors are feared to have lost their
lives. The accident is all the more painful because the Navy had recently
achieved two major successes in the form of its first nuclear submarine,
INS Arihant and the aircraft carrier, INS Vikrant.

We pay homage to the brave hearts we have lost. We also congratulate
the Navy on its successes.

Brothers and Sisters,
We achieved independence in 1947 under the leadership of Mahatma
Gandhi. If we look at our subsequent journey, we would find that our
country has seen major changes every ten years.

In the decade beginning 1950, India took its first steps as a democratic
republic under the leadership of Pandit Jawahar Lal Nehru. We established
institutions like the Atomic Energy Commission, Planning Commission and
Election Commission, which went on to make a major contribution to the
processes of nation building in later years. The first general elections were
conducted and a beginning was made towards the formulation of the First
Five Year Plan for socio-economic development of the country.

In the Sixties, Pandit Nehru set up new industries and factories,
implemented new irrigation projects and opened new universities. By laying
emphasis on the role of Science and Technology in nation building he
started the work of transforming this ancient country into a modern nation.

In the Seventies, Indiraji boosted our confidence as a nation. During this
period, we launched our first satellite in space. The Green Revolution
enabled us to be self sufficient in food grains for the first time.

In the next decade, Rajiv Gandhiji set into motion the process of
technological and economic modernization. The foundation for the progress
we later made in the area of Information Technology was laid during this
period. The importance of Panchayati Raj Institutions was emphasized and
this later resulted in amendments to our Constitutions for strengthening and
empowering these institutions.

In the year 1991, under the leadership of Shri Narsimha Rao, we
successfully negotiated a major economic crisis and embraced reforms for
strengthening our economy. These reforms were opposed by many political
parties at that time. But the reforms were in national interest and were
therefore continued by all governments that came to power subsequently.
Since then, the reform process has continually moved forward.

I believe that the last decade has also been a decade of major changes in
the history of our nation. In no other decade has our economic
development increased as much as in this decade. Democratic forces have
been strengthened and many sections of our society have joined the
mainstream of development for the first time. The common man has been
given new rights which have led to his social and economic empowerment.

Brothers and Sisters,

The first UPA government came to power in May 2004. Ever since, we
have worked with sincerity and honesty to build a progressive and modern
India.

We have envisioned a prosperous India. An India which has got rid of
centuries old burden of poverty, hunger and disease. Where the light of
education has driven away the darkness of ignorance and superstition.

Where there is social equality and all citizens enjoy equal economic
opportunity. Where no section of the society faces injustice and
exploitation.

We have dreamt of an India where the youth get employment opportunities
that enable them to contribute to the noble endeavour of nation building.

We have strived for India’s voice to be heard loud and clear at the
international level. We have strived to build a nation that is looked at with
respect and honour by the whole world.

We have taken many measures to realise these dreams. But the journey is
long and a large distance still remains to be travelled.
Brothers and Sisters,

We have recently issued an Ordinance towards a Food Security law. The
Food Security Bill is now before Parliament and we hope it will be passed
shortly. This law will benefit 75 percent of our rural population and half of
our urban population. Under the law, about 81 crore Indians would be
entitled to receive rice at 3 Rupees per kg, wheat at 2 Rupees per kg and
coarse grains at 1 Rupee per kg. This is the largest effort of its kind in the
whole world.

We have been able to implement this law only because of the hard work of
our farmers. Our food-grain production reached a record level of 25.9 crore
ton in 2011-12.

Without rapid agricultural growth, we cannot achieve our goal of making our
villages prosperous. We have constantly endeavoured to increase
production and to ensure that farmers get remunerative prices for their
produce. In the last 9 years, support prices for various crops have been
enhanced as never before. The support prices for wheat and paddy have
been more than doubled. Many States which faced shortages of
food-grains earlier are now producing more than what they require for
themselves.

The average annual rate of agricultural growth in the 11th Plan was 3.6,
which is more than both the 9th and 10th Plan levels.

We now see clear indications of enhanced economic prosperity in our rural
areas. In the period 2004 to 2011, rural per-capita consumption has
increased four times faster than earlier.

Rural wages have also increased much faster in this period. MNREGA
provides employment to crores of people in rural areas.
Measuring poverty is a difficult task. There are diverse views about what
constitutes poverty. But whatever definition we may adopt, it cannot be
denied that the pace of reduction in poverty has increased after 2004.

Many States which had been considered backward for a long time, with
some of them being called Bimaru, are now progressing rapidly.

We have enacted the Right to Education Act to provide every child in the
country the opportunity for education. Almost all our children are today
being imparted education in Primary schools.

The number of young men and women going to college has more than
doubled in the last 9 years.

We have implemented new schemes for scholarships on a large scale to
enable poor children and those belonging to the weaker sections to access
opportunities for education. Today, the Central government provides
scholarships to more than 2 crore children.

Many new institutions have been opened in the area of Higher education.
For example, 8 new IITs, 7 New IIMs, 16 new Central universities and 10
new NITs. New institutions have also been opened to boost scientific
research. Steps have been taken to attract students to the study of science
and encourage Indian scientists working abroad to return to India.

However, much still remains to be done for reforming our education
system. Many of our schools still lack drinking water facilities, toilets and
other necessary infrastructure. There is a need to improve the quality of
education. To achieve this, it is necessary to lay more emphasis on training
of teachers.

About 11 crore children are being provided afternoon meals every day in
schools under the Mid-day Meal Scheme. This programme is of immense
benefit for both education and nutrition of children. However, it is necessary
to improve its implementation. The tragedy that happened in Bihar some
days back should not be repeated anywhere in the country.

We had launched the National Rural Health Mission in 2005. The Mission
has started showing good results. Both Maternal Maternity and Infant
Mortality rates have come down sharply. A much larger proportion of
children is now born in hospitals. There has also been a large increase in
the proportion of children being inoculated.

No case of polio has been detected in the country in the last two years. We
have been able to eradicate a disease which used to cause disability to
lakhs of people.

The Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana, which provides free in-patient
treatment in hospitals to our poor brothers and sisters, now covers about
3.5 crore families.

We have implemented the Health Mission in urban areas also. This will
result in both expansion and improvement of health services in such areas.

For ensuring better safety and security for women, we have strengthened
the law dealing with offences against women.

There has been good progress in the last 9 years in the infrastructure
sector also, covering areas such as Roads, Railways, Power, Civil Aviation,
Ports and Telecommunications. About 2 lakh km of new roads have been
constructed for connecting villages under the Pradhan Mantri Gramin
Sadak Yojana. More than 37,000 km of new Highways have been built,
facilitating travel and trade. More than 40 airports have been built or
upgraded. In 2004, only 7 percent of the people had telephone
connections. Today, 73 percent enjoy this facility. In rural areas, this figure
has gone up from 2 to 40. There has been a record addition to our capacity
for electricity generation.

Brothers and Sisters,

In the recent months, there has been much discussion on the fact that last
year our growth rate came down to 5 percent. This is indeed true and we
are trying our best to remedy the situation. However, it is not only our
country that is facing economic difficulties. The last year has been difficult
for the world economy as a whole. Major European nations are
experiencing a slowdown these days. All over the world, there has been a
slump in export markets. All developing countries have slowed down.

I believe that this phase of slow growth in India will not last long. In the last
9 years, our economy has grown at an annual average rate of 7.9 percent.
This pace of development is the highest in any decade so far.

Brothers and Sisters,

Countries today are more integrated with each other than ever before. We
have endeavoured that our foreign policy exploits this fully to India’s
benefit. In the last 9 years, there has been a continuous improvement in
our relations with the major powers of the world. Our Look East policy in
respect of 10 ASEAN countries in East and South-East Asia has borne
good results, especially in economic matters. We have also strived for
friendship with our neighbouring countries. However, for relations with
Pakistan to improve, it is essential that they prevent the use of their territory
and territory under their control for any anti-India activity.

There has been improvement in the area of national security also. Despite
some worrisome communal incidents in 2012 and this year, the last 9 years
have been good for communal harmony. There has been a reduction in
terrorist and Naxal violence also. However, the area of national security
calls for constant vigil. We have not been successful in preventing Naxal
attacks that happen from time to time. The Naxal violence in Chhatisgarh
on 25 May was a frontal attack on our democracy. Recently, there was a
dastardly attack on our Jawans on the Line of Control with Pakistan. We
will take all possible steps to prevent such incidents in the future.

Brothers and Sisters,

We have taken many important measures to make the work of the
government responsive, transparent and honest. I would like to mention
only two of them here.

Through the RTI Act, the common man now gets more information than
ever before about the work of the government. This legislation is being
used on a large scale at all levels. The Act frequently brings to light
irregularities and corruption and opens the door for improvements. I am
sure that the RTI will lead to further improvements in the way the
government functions.

We have introduced the Lokpal Bill in Parliament. The Lok Sabha has
passed the Bill and it is now before the Rajya Sabha. This legislation will be
a major step towards making our political system clean.

Brothers and Sisters,

We have journeyed a large distance in the last decade. But much remains
to be done. The process of change that we have initiated will be continued
in the coming time.

As I have stated earlier also, rapid economic growth is an imperative for our
country. Without it, we cannot possibly achieve targets such as removal of
poverty, provision of good quality education and health services and
creation of new employment opportunities. The average rate of economic
growth that we have attained in the last 9 years shows what we are
capable of. However, economic growth has slowed down at present and we
are working hard to remedy the situation.

We have recently taken many steps to speed up the process of
government clearances for industry, build an environment more conducive
to trade and industry and increase investment in the economy. A special
Cell has been set up to help big projects with clearances. The Cabinet
Committee on Investment is working to remove hindrances in the way of
stalled projects.

Inadequate supply of coal had become a major problem affecting our
efforts for increasing electricity generation. This has been resolved to a
large extent.

We will start work on a number of new infrastructure projects in the coming
months. This includes 2 new ports, 8 new airports, new industrial corridors
and Rail projects.

To boost Foreign Direct Investment, we have recently enhanced the limit of
such investment in many sectors and made its easier procedurally.

In the coming months, we will see visible results of these efforts to increase
investment. Our growth will accelerate, new employment opportunities will
be generated and there will be improvements in the infrastructure sector.

Brothers and Sisters,

After the enactment of the Food Security legislation, its implementation will
be one of our priorities. We have already started working in this direction in
partnership with States. Computerization of the Public Distribution System
will be speeded up.

The Mid-day Meal scheme will be reformed. The meals being provided to
our children should not only be nutritious but also be cooked hygienically.
We will take concrete measures to ensure this.

In the area of Skill Development, we could not initially achieve as much
progress as we wanted. But now the pace has picked up. We have
established the National Skill Development Authority a few months back.
We will shortly launch a new scheme under which those who have
successfully acquired new skills will be given a grant of about Rupees
10,000. This scheme will benefit about 10 lakh young men and women in
the next 12 months.

The Multi Sectoral Development Programme for minorities has been
reformed recently. We will now implement it effectively.

A scheme for offering Minimum Support Prices for minor forest produce
has been approved some days back. This will enable our tribal brothers
and sisters to get remunerative prices for the minor forest produce they
collect. We will implement the scheme expeditiously.

A High Level Committee has been constituted to collect accurate
information about the socio-economic, educational and health status of our
tribal population. The report of the Committee will help us in designing
better schemes for their benefit.

We can solve many of the problems that our country faces by deploying
advanced technology. The Aadhaar scheme is a good example. Under the
scheme, by the end of this year, about 50 crore people will acquire the
means of proving their identity and this will bring them convenience in their
daily lives. It will also enable crores of people to avail of banking facilities
for the first time.

Brothers and Sisters,
There can be no place for narrow and sectarian ideologies in a modern,
progressive and secular country. Such ideologies divide our society and
weaken our democracy. We should prevent them from growing. We need
to strengthen those traditions of our country which teach us to promote
tolerance and respect for thought processes different from ours. I would
appeal to all political parties, all sections of our society and the public at
large to work in this direction.

Brothers and Sisters,

I had stated a few minutes back that every decade after independence has
witnessed major changes in our country. We need to think today what
changes we would like to see in the decade ahead.

If in the future we can achieve the same kind of progress as in the last
decade, the day is not far off when India will be rid of poverty, hunger,
disease and ignorance. Our India will be prosperous and all its citizens will
be equal partners in this prosperity, irrespective of their religion, caste,
region or language.

We will also need to build an environment of political stability, social
cohesion and security for this to happen.

Let us all re-dedicate ourselves to building such an India together.

Dear children, please repeat with me thrice: Jai Hind, Jai Hind, Jai Hind."
2012,Manmohan Singh,INC,NA,Printed from the website http://www.pmindia.nic.in,PMO Archive,http://archivepmo.nic.in/drmanmohansingh/content_print.php?nodeid=1199&nodetype=2,"My dear countrymen, brothers, sisters and dear children,

I greet you all on this anniversary of our Independence.

“The leaders of our freedom movement, under the stewardship of Mahatma
Gandhi, had dreamt of an independent and prosperous India. On this day
in 1947, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru took the first step towards the realization
of that dream by hoisting the Tricolour at the Red Fort. The journey we
began on 15 August, 1947 is now 65 years old. We have achieved much in
these 65 years.

Today is certainly a day to celebrate the success of our democracy.
However, on this occasion we should also introspect about what remains to
be done. We would achieve independence in the true sense only when we
are able to banish poverty, illiteracy, hunger and backwardness from our
country. This would be possible only when we learn from our failures and
build on our successes.

You are aware that these days the global economy is passing through a
difficult phase. The pace of economic growth has come down in all
countries of the world. Seen together, the European countries are
estimated to grow at 0 percent this year. Our country has also been
affected by these adverse external conditions. Also, there have been
domestic developments which are hindering our economic growth. Last
year our GDP grew by 6.5 percent. This year we hope to do a little better.

We cannot do much about the conditions that prevail outside our country.
But we must make every effort to resolve the problems inside our country
so that our economic growth and the creation of employment opportunities
in the country are again speeded up.

While doing this, we must also control inflation. This would pose some
difficulty because of a bad monsoon this year. However, we have taken
many measures to deal with the situation. In districts where there has been
a deficit of 50 percent or more in the rainfall, diesel subsidy is being
provided to farmers by the Government. Seed subsidy has been enhanced.
Funds available under the Central scheme for fodder have been increased.
Our effort is to ensure that people do not face difficulty due to shortage of
seeds, fodder or water in any part of the country. It is good that we have a
big stock of foodgrains because of the hard work of our farmer brothers and
sisters, and availability of foodgrains is not a problem for us.

As far as creating an environment within the country for rapid economic
growth is concerned, I believe that we are not being able to achieve this
because of a lack of political consensus on many issues. Time has now
come to view the issues which affect our development processes as
matters of national security.

If we do not increase the pace of the country’s economic growth, take steps
to encourage new investment in the economy, improve the management of
Government finances and work for the livelihood security of the common
man and energy security of the country, then it most certainly affects our
national security.

I promise to you today that our Government will work hard for India’s rapid
economic growth and for shielding the country from the effects of the global
economic slowdown. I promise that we will work hard for creation of new
employment opportunities for our young men and women living in villages
and cities. We will make every possible effort to secure the livelihood of our
poor brothers and sister, our workers and our farmers. We will leave no
stone unturned to encourage investment in our country so that our
entrepreneurs can make a substantial contribution to our economy.

I believe that this period of difficulties will not last long. Even as we face
these problems, we should be encouraged by the fact that we have
achieved extraordinary successes in many areas in the last 8 years. We
now need to replicate these successes in newer areas.

It has been our endeavour in the last 8 years to empower our citizens
socially and economically so that they can contribute to the sacred task of
nation building. Today, one out of every 5 households in the country has
become eligible to benefit from the Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment
Act through a job card. In only the last one year we have provided
employment to more than 8 crore people under this scheme.

When the UPA Government came to power in 2004, we had promised that
we would provide electricity to all villages. To fulfill this promise, we
launched the Rajiv Gandhi Rural Electrification Scheme. More than 1 lakh
new villages have been provided with electricity connections under this
scheme and now almost all the villages in the country have been electrified.
Our next target is to provide electricity to each and every household in our
country in the next 5 years and to also improve the supply of electricity.

No praise is high enough for our hard working farmers. They have
produced a record output of crops successively in the last 2 years.
Because of our Government's efforts for development of agriculture and for
protecting the interests of farmers, agriculture has grown at an average rate
of 3.3 per cent in the 11th Plan which is substantially higher than the 2.4
per cent we achieved in the 10th Plan. In the last 8 years, we have doubled
the support prices of crops. We are providing loans at low interest rates to
lakhs of farmers.

Our children are the biggest strength of our country. If our children are
provided with good education and are healthy, then our future would be
bright.

This is the reason why we have paid special attention to the needs of
children in our policies and programmes. The education of children has
been made mandatory by law. In the year 2006-07, only 93 per cent of
children in the age group 6-14 years were getting admission in schools.
Today almost all children in this age group are being admitted to schools.
More than 51,000 new schools have been opened in the country and about
7 lakh teachers appointed in them in just the last 2 years. Now we will focus
on improving the quality of education. In the next few months we will put in
place a system of continuous assessment of the benefit our children are
getting from teaching. Participation of the community and parents would be
ensured so that they can be satisfied with the quality of teaching.

The Mid-day-meal Scheme provides nutritious meals in schools for about
12 crore children everyday. This is the biggest scheme of its kind in the
world.

In the last one and half years no new case of polio has come to light and
now India does not figure in the list of countries affected by this disease.

Malnutrition in children is a big challenge for us. We have taken steps in
many dimensions to deal with this problem. In the last 8 years, the number
of mothers and children benefitting from the ICDS has doubled. The
process of making the ICDS more effective is in its last stages and will be
completed in the next 1 or 2 months.

We had launched the National Rural Health Mission in 2005 so that health
services can be extended to each village in the country. Today this Mission
is being implemented with the help of 10 lakh health personnel including
8.5 lakh Asha workers. After the success of the National Rural health
Mission, we now want to expand the scope of health services in our towns
also. The National Rural Health Mission will be converted into a National
Health Mission which would cover all villages and towns in the country. We
are also formulating a scheme for distribution of free medicines through
Government hospitals and health centres.

We want to create many new job opportunities for our youth in the coming
years. To achieve this it is necessary that we train them in skills which our
economy needs. It is our endeavour to put in place a system in which
training facilities are available in many new skills. We also wish to provide
short duration training courses of 6 weeks to 6 months for our young
brothers and sisters. The National Skill Development Council has
formulated a major scheme for skill development in which 8 crore people
will be trained in the next 5 years. This is an ambitious scheme which can
be implemented only through a specialized agency of the Central
Government. Therefore, we are considering the establishment of a National
Skill Development Authority so that skill development programmes all over
the country can be implemented in a coordinated manner. We would also
need contribution from the private sector and non-Governmental
organizations in this work.

Creation of new employment opportunities is possible only when we
encourage industry and trade. For this we need to speedily improve our
infrastructure. Recently we have taken new measures to accelerate
infrastructure development. Ambitious targets have been fixed in roads,
airports, railways, electricity generation and coal production. The
Government will take steps to increase investment for infrastructure
development with the help of the private sector. To attract foreign capital,
we will have to create confidence at the international level that there are no
barriers to investment in India.

Just 10 years back only 3 out of every 10 households in our villages were
benefitting from banking services. Today more than half of the rural
households get the benefit of bank accounts. It will be our endeavour to
ensure that all households benefit from bank accounts in the next 2 years.

We want to create a system in which money from Government schemes -
pension for old people, scholarship for students and wages for labourers -
can be credited directly into people’s bank accounts. This would reduce
inconvenience to the beneficiaries, make it easy for them to receive
payment and increase transparency. For this work, we will take help from
the Aadhar scheme under which about 20 crore people have been
registered so far.

To provide housing for our poor brothers and sisters residing in urban
areas of our country we will soon launch the Rajiv Housing Loan Scheme.
Under this scheme, people belonging to the economically weaker sections
would be given relief on interest for housing loans of less than Rs. 5 lakh.

This year we will present the Twelfth Five Year Plan for consideration of the
National Development Council. The Plan would determine the future course
of action on all important matters relating to the country's development. It
would lay down measures for increasing our present rate of economic
growth from 6.5 to 9 per cent in the last year of the Plan. The Plan would
focus special attention on areas important from the point of view of
reaching the fruits of development to each citizen of our country and
specially to the weaker sections of our society. I have full confidence that
the Centre and the States will act together to implement the Twelfth Plan in
an effective manner.

The incidents of violence which occurred in Assam recently are very
unfortunate. I know that these incidents have resulted in the disruption of
the lives of a large number of people. We fully sympathize with those
families which have been affected by the violence. We are doing everything
possible to provide relief to them. I also promise to you that our
Government will make every effort to understand the reasons behind the
violence and work hard with the State Governments to ensure that such
incidents are not repeated in any part of the country.

We have achieved success in many areas of internal security. In Jammu
and Kashmir, people participated in large numbers in the Panchayat
elections. There has been a reduction in violence in the North Eastern
States and we are engaged in dialogue with many groups there so that
they can join the mainstream of development. We have initiated new
schemes of development in areas affected by naxal violence to ensure that
the grievances of the people residing there, especially our brothers and
sisters belonging to Scheduled Tribes, can be removed and their lot can be
improved. However, we need to be constantly vigilant as far as internal
security is concerned. Communal harmony has to be maintained at all
costs. Naxalism is still a serious problem. The incidents which occurred in
Pune in the beginning of this month point to the need for much more work
to be done in the area of national security. We will continue to do this work
with sincerity in the future also.

I would like to congratulate our scientists and technologists who have
enhanced our prestige by successfully testing the Agni V Missile and
launching the RISAT- I Satellite in space this year. Recently the Cabinet
has approved the Mars Orbiter Mission. Under this Mission, our spaceship
will go near Mars and collect important scientific information. This
spaceship to Mars will be a huge step for us in the area of science and
technology.

We have seen a lot of discussion in the recent months about the role of our
armed forces and their preparedness. I would like to emphasise here that
our armed forces and paramilitary forces have defended the security of our
country both during war and peace with valour and honour. Our soldiers
have made the biggest of sacrifices, whenever needed. Today I would like
to reassure our countrymen that our armed forces and paramilitary forces
are prepared to face any challenge. The Government will continue to work
for modernizing these forces and providing them with the necessary
technology and equipment. Today, I would like to thank our security forces,
who are guarding our frontiers bravely, from the bottom of my heart. We will
continue to make efforts for their welfare.

Our Government has set up a committee to examine issues relating to pay
and pension of armed forces personnel. This committee will also look into
matters concerning pension of retired men and officers and family pension
being paid to their families. We will take prompt action on the
recommendations of the committee, once they are received.

Our Government has paid special attention to the welfare of Scheduled
Castes, Scheduled Tribes, minorities, women and other weaker sections.
The special needs of our tribal and backward districts are being met
through programmes such as the Integrated Action Plan, Backward
Regions Grant Fund and Tribal Sub Plan. Through the Forest Rights Act,
we have given proprietary rights to lakhs of our brothers and sisters
belonging to Scheduled Tribes on land on which they have been living for
generations. We are formulating a scheme to ensure that people belonging
to Scheduled Tribes can get fair and remunerative prices for the forest
produce they collect. The Government wants to speedily convert the Mines
and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Bill into a legislation. Through
this law we want to provide funds for the benefit of our tribal brothers and
sisters in the mining areas.

We will make the 15 points programme for minorities more effective. The
Multi-Sectoral Development Programme being implemented in districts with
large minority populations will be expanded.

We have enhanced the amount of post-matric scholarship available to
children belonging to Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, Other
Backward Classes and minorities. Our efforts to make these scholarship
schemes more effective will continue.We are considering a new and
effective law to put an end to the repulsive practice of manual scavenging
and to provide opportunities to those engaged in this practice to begin their
lives afresh.

Our commitment to make the work of the Government and administration
transparent and accountable stands. On the last Independence Day, I
promised you that we would take many steps for this purpose. I am happy
to state that during the last 1 year we have achieved good progress in this
area. The Lok Sabha has cleared the Lokpal and Lokayukta Bill. We hope
that all political parties will help us in passing this Bill in the Rajya Sabha. A
number of other Bills have also been presented before the Parliament. The
Cabinet has cleared a Public Procurement Bill. We will continue our efforts
to bring more transparency and accountability in the work of public servants
and to reduce corruption. But we will also take care that these measures do
not result in a situation in which the morale of public functionaries taking
decisions in public interest gets affected because of baseless allegations
and unnecessary litigation.

In my first message to the country after assuming the office of Prime
Minister I had appealed to you to contribute to the sacred work of nation
building. I am very happy that today more of our citizens than ever before,
and specially the youth, are taking interest in issues related to the progress
of our society and country. Our Government believes that the difficult
problems which India faces can be resolved only with the cooperation of
the common man. It will be our endeavour that in the coming time, still
more people help us in tasks like removal of poverty, illiteracy and
inequality.

I believe that no power in the world can stop our country from achieving
new heights of progress and development. What is needed is that we work
together as one people for the success of our country. Let us once more
resolve that we will continue to work for a progressive, modern and
prosperous India.”

Dear children join me in saying

Jai Hind,
Jai Hind,
Jai Hind."
2011,Manmohan Singh,INC,NA,(English rendering),PMO Archive,http://archivepmo.nic.in/drmanmohansingh/content_print.php?nodeid=1045&nodetype=2,"My dear countrymen,

I heartily greet 120 crore Indians on the 64th anniversary of our
independence.

I have been addressing you from the historic Red Fort for the last seven
years. In these seven years, our country has achieved much. During this
period, we have travelled rapidly on the path of development and have
seen success in many areas. However, I am also well aware that a lot
remains to be done. We have to banish poverty and illiteracy from our
country. We have to provide the common man with access to improved
health services. We have to provide employment opportunities to each one
of our youth.

The road ahead is long and arduous. Particularly, the prevailing situation
both inside and outside the country is such that if we do not act with
understanding and restraint, our security and prosperity can get adversely
affected. The world economy is slowing down. The developed countries
especially America and countries of Western Europe are facing economic
problems. There is unrest in many Arab countries of the Middle East. There
are some people who want to create disturbances in the country so that our
progress gets stalled. All this can have a negative impact on us. But we will
not let this happen. I know that if we work together, we can face any
challenge. However, it is necessary that we rise above personal or political
interests and build consensus on issues of vital national importance.

Brothers and sisters,

We are building the edifice of modern India on the foundation of the hard
work and sacrifices of our soldiers, our farmers and our workers. We will
not let their hard work and sacrifices go waste. We will convert the dreams
of our freedom fighters into reality.
Brothers and sisters,

In the last seven years, our government has strived for political stability and
social and economic progress. We have established an environment of
communal harmony in the country.

In these seven years, the pace of our economic development has been
rapid. We have achieved this success despite the global economic
slow-down of 2008 and rising prices of energy and commodities in world
markets.

We have strived for reducing inequalities in the country. In the last seven
years, we have taken special care of the needs of our brothers and sisters
from the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, minorities, women and
children.

We have enacted laws which would guarantee our people their basic
entitlements. After the rights to education, employment and information, we
will soon enact a legislation for providing food security to the people.

In the last seven years, our relations with various countries of the world
have strengthened and deepened. It is only the result of our hard work that
today we have much more self respect and self-confidence in ourselves.

Brothers and sisters,

These successes are not ordinary. Today the world recognizes our
potential to be one of the major economic powers globally. But the problem
of corruption is a big obstacle in such a transformation.

In the last few months many instances of corruption have come to light. In
some cases, functionaries of the Central government face allegations of
corruption. In other cases, it is the functionaries of various State
governments.

We are taking the strictest possible action in cases of corruption that have
surfaced. These cases are sub-judice and hence I will say nothing more on
this subject.

It is essential that when we consider these issues, we do not create an
atmosphere in which the country's progress comes into question. Any
debate on these matters should reflect the confidence that we can
overcome these challenges.

Corruption manifests itself in many forms. In some instances, funds meant
for schemes for the welfare of the common man end up in the pocket of
government officials. In some other instances government discretion is
used to favour a selected few. There are also cases where government
contracts are wrongfully awarded to the wrong people. We cannot let such
activities continue unchecked.

I believe that there is no single big step which we can take to eradicate
corruption. In fact, we will have to act simultaneously on many fronts.

We will have to improve our justice delivery system. Everyone should know
that quick action will be taken against the corrupt and punishment meted
out to them. If our system delivers justice in an effective manner,
government officials would think twice before committing a wrong act out of
greed or under political pressure.

We want a strong Lokpal to prevent corruption in high places. We have
recently introduced a Bill in Parliament to achieve this. Now only Parliament
can decide what type of Lokpal legislation should be enacted. I am aware
of the differences of opinion on some aspects of the Bill. Those who don't
agree with this Bill can put forward their views to Parliament, political
parties and even the press. However, I also believe that they should not
resort to hunger strikes and fasts unto death.

It is not appropriate to bring the judiciary under the ambit of Lokpal. We
believe that any such provision would go against the independence of the
judiciary. However, we do need a framework in which the judiciary
becomes more accountable. It is with this aim that we have introduced the
Judicial Accountability Bill in Parliament. I am confident that this Bill will be
passed soon.

An alert press and an aware citizenry can be very helpful in the fight
against corruption. The Indian press is known for its independence and
activism throughout the world. The Right to Information legislation that we
have enacted has enabled our press and people to keep a strict watch on
the work of the government.

Today many government decisions, which in the absence of this Act would
escape public scrutiny, are coming to light. I believe that this is a big step
forward in eradicating corruption.

Brothers and Sisters,

Many times, government discretion is misused in allocation of scarce
resources and in the grant of clearances. We have examined this issue.
We will put an end to such discretionary powers wherever possible.

Any government awards contracts worth thousands of crores every year.
There are frequent complaints of corruption in these decisions. We had
constituted a committee to suggest measures to reduce corruption in
government purchases. The committee has recommended that, like many
other countries, we should also have a public procurement legislation which
lays down the principles and practice with regard to government purchases.
We will introduce a Bill in Parliament by the end of this year to enact such a
law.
In recent years, we have established independent regulatory authorities in
many areas. These authorities discharge many responsibilities which were
earlier in the domain of the government itself. We have no legislation which
would enable monitoring of the work of these regulatory authorities and
make them more accountable, without, however, compromising their
independence. We are also considering enactment of such a law.

Brothers and sisters,

I have said so much on corruption because I know that this problem is a
matter of deep concern for all of us. However, this is a difficulty for which
no government has a magic wand. We are taking simultaneous action on
many fronts in our fight against corruption. We want all political parties to
stand shoulder to shoulder with us in this fight. To eradicate corruption, we
have introduced, and will introduce, many Bills in Parliament. I hope that all
political parties will cooperate in the process of converting these Bills into
statutes. On the issue of corruption, I would like to say in the end that we
can win the fight against corruption only when each and every citizen of
India cooperates in it.

Brothers and sisters,

I congratulate the country's farmers for their achievements this year. The
production of foodgrains has been at a record level. Wheat, maize, pulses
and oilseeds have all seen record levels of production. It is because of the
hard work of our farmers that today there are proposals for export of
foodgrains, sugar and cotton.

We need a second Green Revolution in agriculture. We can tackle the
problem of rising food prices only by increasing agricultural production and
productivity. We also need to increase agricultural production to implement
a food security law. We will accelerate our efforts in this direction in the
12th Plan.

Today, I wish to assure our farmer brothers and sisters, particularly those
who are small and marginal, that we will continue to take care of their
special needs. It will be our endeavour to ensure that our farmers have
easy access to fertilizers, seeds and credit. We also want to provide the
best possible irrigation facilities to the farmers so that their dependence on
rains is reduced.

Brothers and sisters,

Our country is passing through a phase of sustained high inflation.
Controlling rising prices is a primary responsibility of any government. Our
government fully understands this responsibility. We have continuously
taken steps to rein in prices. Some time we have been confronted with a
situation in which the reasons for rising prices lay outside the country. The
prices of petroleum products, foodgrains and edible oil have risen steeply in
international markets in recent times. Since we import these products in
large quantities, any rise in their prices adds to inflationary pressure in our
country. Sometimes we have been successful too in controlling inflation.
But this success has not proved lasting. A few days back, the people's
concern at rising prices was also reflected in a discussion in Parliament. I
wish to assure you today that we are continuously monitoring the situation
to find out what new steps can be taken to arrest rising prices. Finding a
solution to this problem will be our top-most priority in the coming months.

Brothers and sisters,

I am fully aware of the tensions caused in some parts of the country
because of acquisition of land for industry, infrastructure and urbanization.
Our farmers have been especially affected by such acquisition. Land
acquisition is no doubt necessary for projects of public interest. But it
should take place in a transparent and fair manner. The interests of those
whose livelihoods are dependent on the land being acquired should be fully
protected. We will ensure that no injustice is done to anyone in the process
of land acquisition. Our government wants to replace the 117 year old land
acquisition law by a new Land Acquisition and Rehabilitation law which is
forward looking and balanced. We have already prepared a draft legislation
and have initiated steps to build consensus on it. We will soon introduce a
Bill in Parliament to this end.

Brothers and sisters,

We are satisfied with our achievements in the last seven years in the areas
of education and health. Whether it is elementary education, secondary
education or higher education we have taken concrete steps for
improvements at all levels. This has shown good results. In the last few
years, fundamental changes have taken place in the area of education.
Today every citizen has a right to elementary education. We are now
considering universalization of secondary education. Vocational education
and skill development have acquired a new importance. In view of these
major changes, it is necessary that we consider all aspects of education in
a comprehensive manner. Therefore we have decided to appoint an
education commission to make recommendations for improvements at all
levels of education.

I have often referred to the 11th Five Year Plan as an education plan. We
will lay the same emphasis on health in the 12th plan as we laid on
education in the 11th plan. I will propose to the National Development
Council that the 12th plan should be specially focused on health. I also
promise that funds will not be a constraint in the important areas of
education and health.

For a long time our country had no facility for health insurance for workers
in the unorganized sector. In 2008, we began the Rashtriya Swasthya Bima
Yojana for workers in the unorganized sector who are below the poverty
line. In the last year we have covered those getting employment under
Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment Act and also domestic workers, street
vendors and beedi workers under this scheme. Today the Rashtriya
Swasthya Bima Yojana covers about 2 crore 50 lakh workers. Our
government will endeavour to cover as many unorganized sector workers
as possible under this scheme.

Brothers and sisters,

We are continuously strengthening the physical infrastructure in our
country. This is an area which requires very large investments. It is for this
reason that in the last seven years we have pursued policies which
encourage investment in infrastructure. As a percentage of GDP,
investment in this area has grown more than one and a half times in the
last seven years. There have been improvements in our capacities in the
petroleum sector and power generation, and in our airports, roads,
especially rural road, and ports. As an illustration, the capacity in power
generation that we are going to add in the 11th plan will be twice that of the
10th plan. In the 12th Plan, we will further accelerate investment in
infrastructure. We will pay special attention to the remote areas of our
country and to rural areas. Connecting such areas by rail and road will get
the top most priority.

Brothers and sisters,

We have taken a major step this year for our poor brothers and sisters
living in cities. Recently we have approved the Rajiv Awas Yojana. We
want to make India slum free through this scheme. We want the slum
dwellers to get ownership of clean houses and have access to basic
amenities like water and electricity. We will implement the Rajiv Awas
Yojana as a national mission together with the States.

Brothers and sisters,
Malnutrition in our women and children is a matter of concern for all of us.
We have taken a number of steps to tackle this problem, including two new
schemes. We have also decided that we will start implementing an
improved Integrated Child Development Services scheme within the next
six months so that the problem of malnutrition in children can be effectively
addressed.

The figures of census 2011 show improvements in most areas. But it is a
matter of deep regret for us that the sex ratio has shown a decline from the
level of the last census. For an improvement in this state of affairs, it is not
only necessary to implement the existing laws effectively but it is also
essential to change the approach with which our society views girls and
women. I would especially appeal to the State governments and social
service organizations to take steps for empowerment of women and for
improving their status in society.

Brothers and sisters,

Last month's terrorists attacks in Mumbai warn us that there cannot be any
slip up in our vigilance as far as the fight against terrorism is concerned.
This is a long battle to be fought jointly by the Central Government, the
State Governments and the common man. We have been steadily
strengthening our intelligence and security agencies and will continue to do
so in the future also.

We are also taking all possible steps to overcome the challenge of
naxalism. We want to eradicate the very reasons which give rise to this
problem. Therefore we have started a new scheme for the accelerated
development of 60 backward and tribal dominated districts. An amount of
Rs. 3300 crore will be spent on this scheme in a period of two years.

Brothers and sisters,
Preserving our environment even as we develop rapidly is a huge
challenge for us. Climate change poses a threat to both our development
processes and our natural resources. We have established eight missions
on climate change and are working hard to implement these missions. We
have set up the National Ganga River Basin Authority for the protection and
cleaning of river Ganga. We have also established the National Green
Tribunal for quick disposal of cases involving environmental issues. In the
coming months, we will constitute an environmental assessment and
monitoring authority to streamline the process of environmental clearances.

Brothers and sisters,

Our society and country are changing rapidly because of our fast economic
growth. Today our people look towards the future with new hope. They
have higher aspirations. Our young men and women strive for path
breaking achievements. We should all build an environment in the country
in which the energy and enthusiasm of the people are channelised into
activities of nation building. Our institutions should encourage constructive
utilization of the potential of our people. Our entrepreneurs and
businessmen should not feel constrained in their activities. Our
industrialists should have the opportunity to set up new industries so that
our youth can get additional avenues for productive employment. We
should all stay away from politics that create suspicion or apprehension
amongst those connected with industry, business and investment.

Brothers and sisters,

It is not an ordinary achievement for our democracy with a population of
120 crore and so many religions, languages and cultures to march rapidly
ahead on the path of development. I congratulate the people of India on
this achievement. But we must ensure that inequalities do not increase
even as we develop rapidly.
We have embarked on a journey to transform our huge and diverse country
through rapid development. A development which benefits every citizen of
the country. It is natural that tensions would sometimes arise in this
process of change. In a democracy, such tensions also become issues of
political polarization. We should endeavour that even as political parties
oppose and engage in debate against each other, the pace of our progress
does not get affected.

We should also have faith that our democracy, our institutions and our
social ideals and values have the capacity to deal with any difficulty. We
should all have faith in ourselves. The faith that we can build a promising
future for ourselves. The faith, that united we can do the most difficult of
tasks. Let us all resolve to build a bright future for our country.

Dear Children, join me in saying

Jai Hind

Jai Hind

Jai Hind."
2010,Manmohan Singh,INC,NA,Printed from the website http://www.pmindia.nic.in,PMO Archive,http://archivepmo.nic.in/drmanmohansingh/content_print.php?nodeid=917&nodetype=2,"Dear citizens,

1.    I greet you on the 63rd anniversary of our independence. When
Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru unfurled the Tricolour on this historic Red Fort, on
15th August, 1947, he called himself the first servant of India. I address you
today in the same spirit of service.

2.     A few days back, many precious lives were lost in Laddakh due to a
cloud burst. I convey my heart felt condolences to the family members and
other near and dear ones of those who have perished. In this hour of grief,
the whole country stands with the people of Laddakh. It is my assurance
that the Central Government will do everything possible for rehabilitation of
the affected people.

3.    When I addressed you last year on Independence Day, our country
was facing a number of difficulties. There was a drought like situation in
many parts of the country. We were also affected by the global economic
slow down. I am happy to say that we have acquitted ourselves well in
these difficult circumstances. Despite many problems, the rate of our
economic growth has been better than most other countries in the world.
This shows the strength of our economy.

4.    This strength has been evident not only in the last one year but also
in our economic progress in the last many years. Today, India stands
among the fastest growing economies of the world. As the world's largest
democracy, we have become an example for many other countries to
emulate. Our citizens have the right to make their voice heard. Our country
is viewed with respect all over the world. Our views command attention in
international fora.

5.   All of you have contributed to India's success. The hard work of our
workers, our artisans, our farmers has brought our country to where it
stands today. I specially salute our soldiers whose bravery ensures the
safety of our borders. I pay tribute to all those martyrs who have sacrificed
their lives for our country.

6.     We are building a new India in which every citizen would have a
stake, an India which would be prosperous and in which all citizens would
be able to live a life of honour and dignity in an environment of peace and
goodwill. An India in which all problems could be solved through
democratic means. An India in which the basic rights of every citizen would
be protected. In the last few years, we have taken many significant steps in
this direction. Every person living in rural areas now has the assurance of
100 days of employment through the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural
Employment Guarantee Act. The Right to Information Act is helping our
citizens to become more aware. This year our Government has enacted the
Right to Education which will help every Indian to share in the benefits of
the country's economic progress and also to contribute to it. To ensure
equal partnership of women in our progress, we have taken initiative for
reservation for women in Parliament and in State legislatures. Apart from
this, reservation for women has been increased to 50 per cent in local
bodies.

7.    Despite our many strengths, we face some serious challenges. We
should resolve today that we will meet these challenges as one people. Our
society often gets divided in the name of religion, State, caste or language.
We should resolve that we will not allow divisions in our society under any
circumstance. Tolerance and generosity have been a part of our traditions.
We should strengthen these traditions. As we progress economically our
society should also become more sensitive. We should be modern and
progressive in our outlook.

8.    Our Government has laid special emphasis on the welfare of our
farmers and on increasing agricultural production. After we came to power
in 2004, we realized that the state of Indian agriculture in the preceding 7-8
years was not satisfactory. Our Government increased public investment in
agriculture. We started new schemes for increasing production. We
encouraged agricultural planning at the district level. I am happy that the
growth rate of our agriculture has increased substantially in the last few
years. But we are still far from achieving our goal. We need to work harder
so that we can increase the agricultural growth rate to 4 per cent per
annum.

9.    Our Government wants a food safety net in which no citizen of ours
would go hungry. This requires enhanced agricultural production which is
possible only by increasing productivity. Our country has not witnessed any
big technological breakthrough in agriculture after the Green Revolution.
We need technology which would address the needs of dry land
agriculture. In addition, our agriculture should also be able to deal with new
challenges like climate change, falling levels of ground water and
deteriorating quality of soil. In the history of Indian agriculture, Norman
Borlaug commands a special place. About 40 to 50 years back he
developed new and more productive seeds of wheat. Under the leadership
of Smt. Indira Gandhiji, India achieved the Green Revolution by adopting
these seeds. I am happy to announce that the Borlaug Institute of South
Asia is being established in India. This institute would facilitate availability
of new and improved seeds and new technology to the farmers of India and
other countries of South Asia.

10. We have always taken care to provide remunerative prices to farmers
so that they are encouraged to increase production. Support prices have
been increased every year in the last six years. The support price for wheat
was enhanced to Rs.1,100 per quintal last year from Rs.630 per quintal in
2003-04. In paddy, this increase was from Rs.550 per quintal to Rs.1,000
per quintal. But one effect of providing higher prices to farmers is that food
prices in the open market also increase.

11. I know that in the last few months high inflation has caused you
difficulties. It is the poor who are the worst affected by rising prices,
especially when the prices of commodities of every day use like foodgrains,
pulses, vegetables increase. It is for this reason that we have endeavored
to minimize the burden of increased prices on the poor. Today, I do not
want to go into the detailed reasons for high inflation. But, I would certainly
like to say that we are making every possible effort to tackle this problem. I
am also confident that we will succeed in these efforts.

12. It is obvious that any person or institution cannot spend more than his
income over a long period of time, even if it is the Government. It is our
responsibility that we manage our economy with prudence so that our
development is not affected adversely in the future because of high debt.
We import about 80 per cent of our requirement of petroleum products.
After 2004, we have increased the prices of petroleum products much less
compared to the increase in the price of crude oil in the international
market. The subsidy on petroleum products has been increasing every
year. It had become necessary therefore to increase the prices of
petroleum products. If this had not been done, it would not have been
possible for our budget to bear the burden of subsidy and our programmes
for education, health and employment of the poor would have been
adversely affected.

13. In the 63 years after independence, India has covered a long
distance on the path of development. But our destination is still far away. A
large part of our population still suffers from persistent poverty, hunger and
disease. When our Government came to power in 2004, we resolved to
build a new India under a progressive social agenda. We wanted the fruits
of development to reach the common man. We initiated programmes
especially targeted to the welfare of the socially and economically
backward sections of our society. We still stand committed to the welfare of
the poor, the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, minorities, women
and other backward sections of our society. But today we do not need
many new programmes to achieve our goals. However, we do need to
implement the schemes we have already started more effectively,
minimizing the chances of corruption and misuse of public money. We want
to achieve this in partnership with the State Governments, Panchayat Raj
Institutions and civil society groups.

14. Secularism is one of the pillars of our democracy. It has been the
tradition of our country and society to treat all religions with equal respect.
For centuries India has welcomed new religions and all have flourished
here. Secularism is also our constitutional obligation. Our Government is
committed to maintain communal peace and harmony. We also consider it
our duty to protect the minorities and provide for their special needs. This is
why we have started many new programmes in the last four years for the
welfare of our brothers and sisters belonging to the minority communities.
These include scholarships for minority students and special programmes
for the development of districts which have a high concentration of
minorities. These schemes have shown good results. We will vigorously
take this work forward.

15. We have been giving special attention to education and health in the
last six years. Improvement in these two areas is an important component
of our strategy for inclusive growth. It is also necessary for higher economic
growth in the years to come. After independence, these two areas could
not get the importance they deserved. We tried to change this state of
affairs in the 11th Plan. Today, almost every child in our country has
access to primary education. Now, we need to pay more attention to
secondary and higher education. We also need to improve the quality of
education at all levels. It is our endeavour that every child, irrespective of
whether he is rich or poor and which section of the society he belongs to,
should be given an education that enables him to realize his potential and
makes him a responsible citizen of our country. We will continue to
implement the new schemes that we have started in the last six years in
the areas of education and health with sincerity and hard work and in
partnership with the State Governments. We will soon bring a Bill to
Parliament for constitution of two separate councils in higher education and
health respectively so that reforms in these two areas can be accelerated.

16. Nutritious food and good health services are necessary but not
enough for ensuring good health of our citizens. We also need cleanliness
and good sanitation in our villages, towns and cities. There are many
diseases which would be difficult to prevent otherwise. The truth is that our
country lags behind in this area. I consider it a primary responsibility of all
our citizens to maintain cleanliness and hygiene around them. I would like
our children to be taught the importance of cleanliness and hygiene in
schools from the very beginning under a campaign for a Clean India. I
appeal to the State Governments, Panchayat Raj Institutions, civil society
groups and common citizens to make this campaign successful.

17. Mahatma Gandhi had said that our earth has enough for everyone's
need but not for everyone's greed. Imprudent use of the earth's natural
resources has resulted in the problem of climate change. We need to use
our natural resources with care and prudence. It is our responsibility
towards the coming generations to protect and preserve our forests, rivers
and mountains. Our government will endeavour to take care of
environmental concerns in our projects for economic development.

18. There is a large deficit in our physical infrastructure which affects our
economic development adversely. There is a shortfall in the supply of
electricity to industries. Our roads, ports and airports are not of world
standards. We have been trying to increase electricity production and
improve our roads, ports and airports. The resources required to create
good physical infrastructure are difficult for the Government alone to
mobilize. Therefore, we have endeavoured to involve the private sector in
our efforts. The steps that we have taken after 2004 to improve our
physical infrastructure have started bearing fruit now. About one and half a
months back, I dedicated a new terminal of the Delhi airport to the nation.
This is an excellent terminal which has been completed in record time. We
will continue to make such efforts to improve our physical infrastructure.
19. There has been much discussion recently on the issue of internal
security. If law and order in any part of India deteriorates or peace and
harmony gets disturbed, the common man is adversely affected. Therefore,
it is one of the primary responsibilities of any government to maintain law
and order so that the citizens can live and earn their livelihood in an
atmosphere of peace and harmony. Naxalism is a serious challenge to our
internal security. I pay tribute to the men and officers of our security forces
who have became martyrs in the attacks by naxalites in the last few
months. I have stated this before and I say it again - our Government will
fully discharge its responsibility to protect each and every citizen of our
country. We will deal firmly with those who resort to violence. We will
provide all possible help to State Governments to maintain the rule of law in
areas affected by naxalism. I once again appeal to naxalites to abjure
violence, come for talks with the Government and join hands with us to
accelerate social and economic development. A few days back I took a
meeting with the Chief Ministers of States affected by naxalism. We will
fully implement the consensus that emerged in that meeting. I would like to
repeat here a point that I made in that meeting. It is imperative that Centre
and States work together to meet the challenge of naxalism. It would be
very difficult for any State to tackle this problem without cooperation from
the Centre and coordination between States. We all need to rise above our
personal and political interests to meet this challenge.

20. As I have stated earlier, most naxalite affected areas lag behind in
development. Many such areas also have a large concentration of our
adivasi brothers and sisters. We want to end the neglect of these areas. I
have asked the Planning Commission to formulate a comprehensive
scheme towards this end, which we would implement fully. It is also our
endeavour that our adivasi brothers and sisters join the mainstream of
development. They have been dependent on forest produce for centuries
and this dependence should not end without the creation of new sources of
livelihood. Apart from adequate compensation for land which is acquired
from them, we should also ensure that our adivasi brothers and sisters
have a stake in the developmental project being undertaken.

21. I would like to state one more thing in this context. It is very
necessary to make the administrative machinery more sensitive in areas
affected by naxalism. The government officials who work there should not
only be sincere but should also be alive to the special needs of our adivasi
brothers and sisters. It is my hope that the State Governments will pay
adequate attention to these requirements.

22. We have a special responsibility towards the States of the North East.
We are trying to live up to that responsibility. The North Eastern part of our
country has been witness to some unpleasant incidents in the recent
months. I would like to convey to all political parties and groups of the North
East that disputes in the name of State or tribe can only harm all of us.
Discussion and dialogue are the only options to resolve complex issues. As
far as the Central Government is concerned, we are ready to take forward
every process of talks which could lead to progress in resolution of
problems.

23. In Jammu and Kashmir, we are ready to talk to every person or group
which abjures violence. Kashmir is an integral part of India. Within this
framework, we are ready to move forward in any talks which would
increase the partnership of the common man in governance and also
enhance their welfare. Recently, some young men have lost their lives in
violence in Jammu and Kashmir. We deeply regret this. The years of
violence should now end. Such violence would not benefit anyone. I believe
that India's democracy has the generosity and flexibility to be able to
address the concerns of any area or group in the country. I recently
participated in a meeting with political parties from Jammu and Kashmir.
We will endeavour to take this process forward. I would like to convey to
our countrymen, especially our citizens in Jammu and Kashmir and in the
North East, that they should adopt democratic means to join hands with us
for their and country's welfare.

24. We want prosperity, peace and harmony in our neighbouring
countries. Whatever differences we have with our neighbouring countries,
we want to resolve them through discussions. As far as Pakistan is
concerned, we expect from them that they would not let their territory be
used for acts of terrorism against India. We have been emphasizing this in
all our discussions with the Pakistan Government. If this is not done, we
cannot progress far in our dialogue with Pakistan.

25. I would also like to say something which is related to our glorious
cultural traditions. The use of harsh and unpleasant words in our political
discourse has increased in recent days. This is against our traditions of
generosity, humility and tolerance. Criticism has a place of its own in a
democracy and in a progressive society. However, criticism should not be
undignified. We should have the capacity to reconcile opposite points of
view on important issues through debate and discussion. I would request
all political parties to consider this issue.

26. The Commonwealth Games will start in Delhi after about one and a
half months. This will be a proud moment for the whole country and
especially for Delhi. I am convinced that all our countrymen will treat the
Games as a national festival and will leave no stone unturned to make
them a success. The successful organization of Commonwealth Games
would be another signal to the world that India is rapidly marching ahead
with confidence.

27. Our future is bright. The day when our dreams will come true is not
far off. Let us all resolve on this anniversary of our independence that we
will keep the flag of our nation flying high. Let us march ahead together on
the path of progress and prosperity.

28.   Dear children, please say Jai Hind with me.

2009,Manmohan Singh,INC,NA,Printed from the website http://www.pmindia.nic.in,PMO Archive,http://archivepmo.nic.in/drmanmohansingh/content_print.php?nodeid=780&nodetype=2,"Dear countrymen, brothers and sisters,

I consider myself fortunate to once again have the opportunity to address
you on this sacred day of 15th August. On this auspicious occasion, I
extend my hearty greetings to all of you.

Today is most certainly a day of happiness and pride for us. We are proud
of our freedom. We are proud of our democracy. We are proud of our
values and ideals. But we should also remember that it has taken the
sacrifices of lakhs of Indians to bring us where we are today. Our well being
and progress have been built upon the foundation of the hard work and
sacrifices of our freedom fighters, the brave jawans of our armed forces,
our farmers, our workers and our scientists.

Today, we remember all those martyrs who laid down their lives for the
freedom and security of our country. The best way of paying homage to
those brave sons of our country will be to resolve today that we will always
stay committed to strengthening the unity and integrity of our nation. Let us
all together take a vow that we will spare no effort to take India to greater
heights.

The elections held a few months back have strengthened our nation and
our democracy. In these elections, the people of India have favoured a
politics that integrates our country and our society. You have chosen a
political arrangement which is secular and which includes many varied
strands of thought. You have voted for a democratic way of life which
provides for resolution of differences through debate and discussion. I am
of the view that we have received a mandate for starting a new era of
cooperation and harmony in our national life.

We accept with humility the great responsibility you have entrusted to us. I
wish to assure you on this sacred day that we will work with sincerity and
dedication to fulfil the expectation of each and every citizen of India. It will
be our effort to ensure that every citizen of India is prosperous and secure
and is able to lead a life of dignity and self respect. We will derive
inspiration in our work from the ideals of service and sacrifice bequeathed
to us by the father of our nation, Mahatma Gandhi. Our Government will
follow the path shown by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, Shrimati Indira Gandhi,
Shri Rajiv Gandhi and other great leaders of our country. It will be our
endeavour to carry everyone with us and to lead the country ahead on the
path of development by creating an environment of consensus and
cooperation.

We know that India's progress can be real only when every citizen of our
country benefits from it. Every Indian has a right over our national
resources. The policies and schemes of our Government in the last 5 years
have been based on this paradigm. It has been our endeavour to ensure
that the benefit of development reaches all sections of the society and all
regions and citizens of the country. Our efforts have succeeded to some
extent. But our work is still incomplete. We will carry it forward with firm
determination and sincerity.

As you know, our economy grew at a rate of about 9% from the year
2004-05 to the year 2007-08. This growth rate came down to 6.7% in
2008-09 due to the global economic crisis. It is only a result of our policies
that the global crisis has affected us to a lesser extent than many other
countries. Restoring our growth rate to 9% is the greatest challenge we
face. We will make every necessary effort to meet this challenge -- whether
it is for increasing capital flows into the country, or for encouraging exports
or for increasing public investment and expenditure. We expect that there
will be an improvement in the situation by the end of this year, but till that
time we will all have to bear with the fall out of the global economic slow
down. I appeal to all businessmen and industrialists to join us in our effort
to tackle this difficult situation and to fulfill their social obligations fully.

I have always believed that India's prosperity is not possible without the
prosperity of our farmers. This is the reason why our Government had
waived bank loans of lakhs of farmers. We have increased the support
prices for agricultural products by far more than ever before. This year
there has been deficiency in the monsoons. This would definitely have
some adverse impact on our crops. But, I am sure we will be able to meet
the situation quite well. We will provide all possible assistance to our
farmers to deal with the drought. In view of the deficiency in the monsoons,
we have postponed the date for repayment of bank loans of our farmers.
We are also giving additional support to farmers for payment of interest on
short term crop loans.

We have adequate stocks of foodgrains. All efforts will be made to control
the rising prices of foodgrains, pulses and other goods of daily use. I
appeal to all State governments to exercise their statutory powers to
prevent hoarding and black marketing of essential commodities.

We will have to adopt modern means to be successful in agriculture. We
will have to make more efficient use of our scarce land and water
resources. Our scientists must devise new techniques to increase the
productivity of our small and marginal farmers. More attention will have to
be paid to the needs of those farmers who do not have means for irrigation.
The country needs another Green Revolution and we will try our best to
make it possible. Our goal is 4% annual growth in agriculture and I am
confident that we will be able to achieve this target in the next 5 years.

It is our ardent desire that not even a single citizen of India should ever go
hungry. This is the reason why we have promised a food security law under
which every family living below the poverty line will get a fixed amount of
foodgrains every month at concessional rates. It is also our national resolve
to root out malnutrition from our country. In this effort, special care will be
taken of the needs of women and children. We will endeavour to extend the
benefit of ICDS to every child below the age of six years in the country by
March 2012.
The first UPA government had given the right to 100 days of employment in
a year to every rural family through the National Rural Employment
Guarantee Act. In the last 4 years, this programme has been expanded to
cover the whole country. The programme has been able to fulfil the
expectations from it to a large extent. In the year 2008-09, it benefited
about 4 crore families. It has also contributed to improvement in rural
infrastructure. In the coming days we will improve the programme to bring
more transparency and accountability into it. New types of works will be
added to the works that can be taken up under the programme.

We know that good education is not only desirable in itself but is also
essential for the empowerment of our people. We have recently enacted
the Right to Education Act. This law provides to each child of our country
the right to elementary education. I wish to make it clear that funds will not
be a constraint as far as education is concerned. We will give special
attention to the needs of disabled children. As a result of our efforts in the
last few years, almost every child in our country has access to primary
education today. Now we also need to pay greater attention to secondary
education. Secondary education will be expanded through a programme
that will ensure that every child in the country gets its benefit. We will
endeavour to provide bank loans and scholarships to the maximum
possible number of students to support their education.

A new scheme will be started to help students from economically weaker
sections of society by way of reduced interest rate on their education loans.
This will benefit about 5 lakh students in getting technical and professional
education.

Good health is one of our basic needs. The National Rural Health Mission
that we have started aims at strengthening the infrastructure for rural public
health services. We will expand the Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana so as
to cover each family below the poverty line. In our journey on the road of
development we will pay special attention to the needs of our differently
abled brothers and sisters. We will increase facilities available for them.

While touching upon issues related to health, I would also like to make a
mention of the flu that is spreading due to the H1N1 virus. As you all know,
some parts of our country have been affected by this illness. The Central
Government and the State Governments will together continue to make all
necessary efforts to control the spread of this infection. I also want to
assure you that the situation does not warrant a disruption of our daily lives
because of fear and anxiety.

The special programmes that our government had started for the
development of rural and urban areas will be accelerated. We have been
successful to some extent in improving the infrastructure in rural areas
through Bharat Nirman. But there is still a wide disparity between the
development of rural and urban areas. To this end, the allocations under
Bharat Nirman have been increased substantially this year. We will set
more ambitious targets for schemes for house construction and
telecommunications in rural areas.

We will accelerate our efforts to improve physical infrastructure in the
country. The Road Transport and National Highways Department has
initiated action for construction of 20 Km of National Highways every day.
Similarly, Railways have started work on the Dedicated Freight Corridors.
We are giving careful attention to the problems of Air India and will resolve
them soon. The schemes of roads, railways and civil aviation being
implemented in Jammu & Kashmir and the States of the North East will be
especially monitored.

We had started the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission for
the urban areas. We will accelerate this programme also. Today, lakhs of
our citizens live in slums which lack basic amenities. We wish to make our
country slum free as early as possible. In the next five years, we will
provide better housing facilities to slum dwellers through a new scheme,
Rajiv Awas Yojana.

Climate change has become an issue of global concern in recent years. If
we don't take the necessary steps in time, our glaciers will melt and our
rivers will go dry. The problems of droughts and floods will grow in
seriousness. We also need to prevent air pollution. India wishes to tackle
the problem of climate change in partnership with other countries of the
world. We have taken a decision to constitute 8 National Missions. We are
committed to meet the challenge of climate change through these 8
Missions. To increase the use of solar energy and to make it affordable, we
will launch the Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission on 14th November
of this year.

The sacred Ganga is the life source for crores of Indians. It is our duty to
keep the river clean. We have constituted the National Ganga Authority in
which the Central and State Governments will jointly work towards this end.
The cooperation of the public is also needed in this effort.

Our natural resources are limited. We must use them more efficiently. We
need a new culture of energy conservation. We also need to prevent the
misuse of water. We will pay more attention to programmes for water
collection and storage. ""Save Water"" should be one of our national slogans.

If we work united, we can meet all challenges that confront us. Our citizens
have the right to express dissent and anger. I also maintain that every
government should be sensitive to people's complaints and dissatisfaction.
But nothing is achieved by destroying public property and indulging in
violence against one's fellow citizens. Our democracy has no place for
those who resort to violence to express their disagreement, and the
government will deal firmly with such people.

Terrorism has emerged as a threat to peace and harmony in all parts of the
world. After the horrific terror attacks in Mumbai in last November, our
government has taken many steps against terrorism. To root out terrorist
activities, our security forces and intelligence agencies are being constantly
upgraded. I am sure that with cooperation from all sections of our society,
we will be successful in eliminating terrorism from our country.

Some parts of our country continue to be affected by the Naxalite menace.
It is the constitutional obligation of the government to protect the life and
liberty of our citizens. Those who think that they can seize power by
recourse to the gun do not understand the strength of our democracy. The
Central Government will redouble its efforts to deal with Naxalite activities.
We will extend all help to the State Governments to make their police
forces more effective. Central forces will be provided wherever they are
needed. We will also do more to ensure better coordination among States.

I would also like to state here that we will endeavour to remove those
causes of social and economic dissatisfaction which give rise to problems
like Naxalism. We believe in a development process which will remove
backwardness, unemployment and reduce disparities in income and
wealth. We seek active partnership of our brothers and sisters of
Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in our development processes.

We do not subscribe to the view that to take special care of the deprived
sections of the society amounts to appeasement. In fact, we believe that it
is our solemn duty to do so. Our government will give its full attention to the
well being of our brothers and sisters belonging to the minority
communities. We have started many schemes for the welfare of the
minorities. These programmes will be taken forward. The funds for the
special schemes taken up for the development of minority concentration
districts have been enhanced quite substantially this year. Similarly, we
have allocated increased funds for scholarship schemes for minorities that
the first UPA government had started. A Bill to prevent communal violence
has been introduced in Parliament and efforts will be made to convert it into
a law as soon as possible.

The practice of female foeticide regrettably persists in our society. This is a
shame for all of us. We must eliminate it as early as possible. Our progress
will be incomplete till women become equal partners in all areas of our life
and in our nation's progress. Our government is committed to the early
passage of the Women's Reservation Bill. This legislation will provide
one-third reservation for women in Parliament and the State Assemblies.
We are also working on a legislation to provide 50% reservation for women
in rural and urban local bodies. In fact, we should find ways and means to
increase the participation of women in all democratic institutions. Our
government will make sustained efforts for social and economic
empowerment of women. We have decided to launch a National Female
Literacy Mission, through which female illiteracy will be reduced by half in
the next three years.

We are proud of our brave soldiers. It is our duty to ensure that
ex-servicemen are able to lead a life of comfort. We have accepted the
recommendations of the committee constituted to examine the issue of
pension of ex-servicemen. This will lead to increased pension for about 12
lakh retired jawans and Junior Commissioned Officers.

In our journey of development, we should not only pay special attention to
some sections of our society, but must also take care of the special needs
of the backward regions of our country. We will redouble our efforts to
remove regional imbalances in the level of development. Here I would like
to make a special mention of our States of the North-East. Our government
will constantly endeavour to make the States of the North East equal
partners in the country's progress. Imphal or Kohima may be physically far
away from Delhi, but the welfare of our brothers and sisters of the North
East is always close to our heart. We know that without their well-being the
country cannot move forward.
There have been two elections in Jammu & Kashmir since I addressed you
on the last Independence Day. The first one was for the State Legislative
Assembly and the second for the Lok Sabha. People of all areas of the
State have participated vigorously in both the elections. This is a proof that
there is no place for separatist thought in Jammu & Kashmir.

Our Government will continue assisting the State Government in improving
governance in all parts of Jammu & Kashmir. It will be our endeavour to
ensure that human rights are respected in the State and all its citizens are
able to lead a life of peace and dignity in an environment of safety and
security. We respect the special assurances and concessions provided to
Jammu & Kashmir in our Constitution. We will continue to honour these
special provisions.

Today's world is becoming smaller in many respects. Whether it is the
international economic crisis or terrorism or climate change - what happens
in one part of the world has an effect on other parts also. The international
economic and political order is changing. Questions are being raised on the
functioning and continued effectiveness of the multilateral institutions
established in the 20th Century.

Our foreign policy should be able to cater to India's interests in these
constantly changing circumstances. I am happy that we have been
successful in doing this to a large extent.

We have good relations with the United States, Russia, China, Japan and
Europe. There is a tremendous amount of goodwill for India and its people
in the countries of South East Asia, Central Asia, West Asia and the Gulf.
We have further strengthened our traditional ties with Africa. We are
looking for new opportunities in Latin America.

As far our neighbours are concerned, we want to live with them in peace
and harmony. We will make every possible effort to create an environment
conducive to the social and economic development of the whole of South
Asia.

However good our programmes and schemes might be, their benefit will
not reach the public till the government machinery is not free of corruption
and till it is not effective in their implementation. I would like our public
administration to be more efficient so that programmes for public good can
be implemented faster. We need to improve our delivery systems to
provide basic services to our citizens. We will act with speed on the
recommendations of the Administrative Reforms Commission to strengthen
governance. Renewed efforts will be made to decentralize public
administration through the Panchayati Raj Institutions and to ensure
greater involvement of people in it. Initiative will be taken for a new
partnership between the civil society and the government so that taxpayers'
money is better spent. We have enacted the Right to Information Act to
enhance accountability and transparency in public life. This law will be
improved so that it is more effective.

We have to make special efforts to strengthen the administrative machinery
for our rural programmes. Those who live in villages and semi-urban areas
should get services similar to the residents of urban areas. Communication
and Information Technology can go a long way in achieving this objective.
Recently, we have set up the Unique Identification Authority of India. This is
a historic step to link up the whole country through a high quality
administrative arrangement. We expect the first set of identity numbers to
be available in the next one to one and a half years.

Today, as I stand before you I can feel the energy of more than 100 crore
Indians marching ahead on the path of progress. Some people question
whether India will ever be able to attain its true potential. I have no doubt
about this. We are rapidly moving forward. We have faith in ourselves. We
have political stability. Our democracy is an example for the whole world.
We are gaining in economic strength. And most importantly, we have full
confidence in our youth. They are our future. I am sure that they will take
our country to a new glory.

Let us all commit ourselves today to working for a golden future. On this
sacred occasion let us resolve that nation building will be our highest duty.

Jai Hind

Jai Hind

Jai Hind."

Greetings to all of you on this happy occasion of our Independence Day.
This is a sacred day for every Indian. Today we remember the sacrifice of
those who under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi fought for our freedom
from foreign rule. Today we remember the hard work and dedication of all
those who have toiled to build a free and modern India. And we re-dedicate
ourselves to that cause. We remember our farmers, our workers and our
teachers. We remember our soldiers - who defend our borders in snowy
mountains, in deserts, in jungles, on the shores and in the oceans.

Brothers and Sisters,

Four years ago, on this day, I stood here before you and spoke to you
about our Government's new vision for a new India. I said to you that it is
our desire to build an India that is just and humane; an India that treats all
its citizens as equals;

an India that is prosperous; an India that lives in peace; an India in which
everyone can find work suited to his or her talent and can work for his or
her brighter future. An India that is secular, that is fair and just to all its
people. An India united in its diversity. It has been our sincere endeavour to
work for the building of such an India.

Brothers and Sisters,

Four years ago I stood here and said to you that I have no promises to
make, but I have promises to keep. The implementation of the National
Common Minimum Programme, was our promise to keep;

To give a ""new deal to rural India"", was our promise to keep;

To make our economy and society inclusive was our promise to keep;
To take India to its rightful place in the comity of nations, was our promise
to keep;

It has been the sincere endeavour of our Government to keep each of
these promises. We have given a new deal to rural India. Through the
Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana we are investing Rs. 25000 crore in
agriculture; To provide relief to our debt distressed farmers we have waived
loans taken from the banks amounting to about Rs. 71000 crore; In the
past four years we have increased bank credit for agricultural sector from
Rs 81000 crore to Rs 225000 crore, and have reduced the interest rates for
farm loans; In order to improve the economic conditions of farmers we have
steeply increased the procurement prices for food grains; 50% for wheat
and 30% for paddy; The National Food Security Mission has been set up to
enhance production of rice, wheat and pulses; Irrigation, watershed
development, rainfed areas development, and flood management have
received our special attention; Our effort at increasing investment in rural
areas and reducing the debt burden of farmers has turned our agricultural
economy around.

After almost a decade of stagnation especially from 1998 to 2004,
investment in agriculture is increasing and there has been a revival in this
area. We have had record production of foodgrains, cotton and sugar in
2007-08. Our farms are once again green. Our godowns are once again
filling up. Our farmers are once again hopeful about their future and their
welfare.

Brothers and Sisters,

I spent the first ten years of my life in a village that had no electricity, no
drinking water supply, no doctor, no roads and no phones. I had to walk
many miles to a school. I had to study at night in the dim light of a kerosene
lamp. After independence there has been considerable development in
rural areas, yet many of our citizens still live a life that I lived in my
childhood.

That is why when our Government took over, we launched Bharat Nirman,
to build rural infrastructure. Our Government is committed to transforming
rural India. In these four years we have taken important initiatives. I am
confident that a new and prosperous India will be built due to our efforts.

My dear Countrymen,

Four years ago I spoke to you about our ""Seven Sutras"" - the seven
priorities for our Government - agriculture, water, education, health care,
employment, urban renewal and infrastructure.

In each area we have taken important initiatives. I have already spoken
about our initiatives for agricultural development and farmer's welfare.

The second important area of development has been infrastructure
development. There is a new dynamism in our railways. New roads are
being built. New seaports and airports are being developed. More and
more of our people now live in our cities. The Jawaharlal Nehru National
Urban Mission has been funding urban development and modernization of
our cities. The National Rural Health Mission has been expanding public
health facilities and services in rural areas.

As someone who started his professional life as a teacher, I feel proud to
say that our Government has been giving special attention to the
development of education in our country. There is a massive increase in
public investment in education at all levels. In elementary education, in
secondary education and in higher education.

We have strengthened Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan and expanded the mid-day
meal programme upto upper primary level in all districts of the country.
About 14 crore children are being provided mid-day meals under this
scheme. We are establishing 6000 new high quality model schools, with at
least one school in each block. 373 new colleges are being opened in
backward districts. We are opening 30 new universities, 8 new IITs, 7 new
IIMs, 20 new IIITs, 5 new Indian Institutes of Science, 2 Schools of
Planning and Architecture, 10 NITs, and a 1000 new polytechnics.

I have called the 11th Five Year Plan our ""National Education Plan"". We
want every section of our society to get access to education. Every child
belonging to a family of SC, ST, OBC and all Minorities, every single child,
boy or girl, must have access to modern education. Our Government is
implementing several new scholarship schemes for the educational
development of our children. Schemes for pre-matric and post-matric
scholarships for children hailing from SC, ST, OBC and Minority families
are being implemented. Special scholarships for meritorious students from
SC, ST, OBC and Minority families have also been launched. Scholarships
for overseas studies are being given to SC and ST students. National
merit-cum-means scholarships for children hailing from economically
weakers sections and children with disabilities have also been approved.

We have established a new Skill Development Mission which will work
under the supervision of the Prime Minister. A Skill Development
Corporation will be created by the Government with the active participation
of the private sector to give special training to our young men and women,
our workers and our technicians.

I am happy to say that we are sincerely implementing most of the
recommendations of the Justice Sachar Committee Report on social,
economic and educational empowerment of our Muslim community.

India will be transformed only when every Indian is literate, well fed, healthy
and can secure gainful employment. I want to see a modern India, imbued
by a scientific temper, where the benefits of modern knowledge flow to all
sections of society. This year we hope to send an Indian spacecraft,
Chandrayan, to the moon. It will be an important milestone in the
development of our space programme.

Brothers and Sisters,

Providing employment has been a special priority for us. Our policies for
agriculture, for industry, for infrastructure development and for skill
development, will all promote employment. Our beloved former Prime
Minister Shrimati Indira Gandhi had said, ""Garibi Hatao"". Our leader
Shrimati Sonia Gandhi has given us the slogan, ""Rozgar Badhao"". Our
Government is making special efforts to create ""rozgar"" to fight ""garibi"".

The National Rural Employment Guarantee Programme is a historic
initiative of our Government. Today the entire country is covered by this
programme. The NREGA is providing minimum livelihood support to the
crores of neediest among us. It is aimed to soften the sharp edges of
poverty. To create more employment we need more investment in
agriculture, in manufacturing and in infrastructure. We need a new wave of
industrialization to generate more employment. If industrial development
has any adverse impact on some of our rural folk, we will ensure that there
is reasonable compensation and proper rehabilitation. A new Rehabilitation
and Resettlement Policy has been formulated and we will seek
Parliament's approval for it.

We have introduced a bill in Parliament to provide social security to the
workers of the unorganized sector. Our Government has launched the Aam
Aadmi Beema Yojana, under which one member of each landless family in
rural areas will be insured. We have also started a programme to provide
health insurance to Below Poverty Line families of workers in the
unorganized sector. Citizens above 65 years of age, living below the
poverty line are being covered under the Indira Gandhi Pension Scheme.
My dear countrymen,

In the past four years we have seen a sharp increase in the rate of
investment. This has contributed to an increase in the rate of growth of the
economy. For the first time in history, we have had four years of nearly
9.0% economic growth. India is among the world's fastest growing
economies.

But there are new challenges that we face. We have the challenge of
inflation. I know how much each one of you is concerned about the recent
rise in prices. The inflation we have seen this year is basically due to
external factors. All over the world and in global markets the price of food,
fuel and other commodities has been rising. In many developing countries
the rate of inflation is double that in India. Our Government has worked
hard to ensure that in India the rate of inflation is not as high as in many
other countries. We have also taken special measures to insulate the
poorer sections of our society from the full impact of rising food and fuel
prices. Our Government has not raised the price of kerosene and fertilizers.
We have not raised the issue price of wheat and rice under PDS.

We are taking determined measures to bring prices under reasonable
control. I have urged all Chief Ministers to improve and strengthen the PDS
to ensure availability of essential commodities to the common man at
reasonable prices. The Reserve Bank of India is moderating the growth of
money supply in the country so that inflation can be controlled. However,
while making these efforts we should avoid doing anything which hurts our
growth.

Brothers and Sisters,

Today, while speaking about the achievements of our Government, I wish
to make one more promise. We have done much, but I realize that there is
more to do. The problem of malnutrition is a curse that we must remove.
Our efforts to provide every child with access to education and to improve
health care services for all citizens will continue. We need to take forward
our initiatives for giving equal status to women and for their social and
economic empowerment. I promise to you that we will continue striving for
the development and prosperity of our country. We will work hard to take
the country to greater heights in all fields.

Brothers and Sisters,

We must apply modern science and technology to find long term solutions
to our energy problem. Our crude oil and gas reserves are limited. We must
find alternative energy sources. I would like our scientists and engineers to
find ways in which we can make better use of solar energy, wind energy,
bio-gas and other sources of energy.

Our economy must grow at the rate of at least ten per cent every year to
get rid of poverty and generate employment for all. A basic requirement for
sustained growth, and for the development of our agriculture and industry is
availability of energy, particularly electricity. All over the world, there is
growing realization of the importance of atomic energy to meet the
challenge of energy security and climate change. It is a clean,
environmental friendly and renewable source of energy.

India's atomic scientists and technologists are world class. They have
developed nuclear energy capacities despite heavy odds. But there are
handicaps which have adversely affected our atomic energy programme.
We have inadequate production of uranium. The quality of our uranium
resources is not comparable to those of other producers. Many countries
have imposed sanctions on trade with India in nuclear materials, nuclear
equipment and nuclear technology. As a result, our nuclear energy
programme has suffered.

The nuclear agreement that we are negotiating with developed countries
will end India's nuclear isolation. It will open up new opportunities for trade
in dual-use high technologies and nuclear materials and equipment,
opening up new pathways to accelerate industrialization of our country. It
will enable us to provide electricity to meet the needs of our farmers, our
artisans, our traders and our industry.

Brothers and Sisters,

Four years ago I said to you that an important challenge we face is the
challenge of providing good governance. We have taken several steps to
make Government transparent, efficient and responsive. The Right to
Information Act was one major step. We have initiated reform and
modernization of Government. The National e-Governance Plan will make
it easier for all our citizens to deal with the various agencies of
Government.

We have completed the examination of the report of the Sixth Pay
Commission. We have gone beyond the recommendations of the
Commission in increasing emoluments of government employees. While
doing this we have taken special care of the interests and welfare of our
armed forces and para-military forces, and government employees working
at lower levels in our civil services. This is one more step in making
Government more efficient.

We need more reforms at all levels of Government. We want to improve
our schools, our hospitals and other public services. The Panchayati Raj
Institutions have an important role to play in decentralization and reform of
Government. We must enhance their administrative and financial powers. I
appeal to State Governments to take all possible steps for improving
governance and to help in the Central Government's initiatives.

My dear Countrymen,
Terrorism, extremism, communalism and fundamentalism have emerged
as major challenges to the unity and integrity of our country. The recent
terrorist attacks in Bangalore, Ahmedabad, Jaipur and other parts of the
country have shocked the nation. What words can I find to condemn such
acts of barbarism. I share the sorrow and grief of people affected by
terrorism. The Government of India will take concrete steps to rehabilitate
and help such families.

I commend our security forces and intelligence agencies for the dedication
with which they are dealing with the problem under difficult circumstances.
But I agree that we have to further strengthen our intelligence agencies and
police forces to deal with the problem of terrorism.

We will examine the functioning of our intelligence agencies and police and
security forces and take all possible steps to equip them to tackle this
challenge. Whatever resources are required, will be provided. Whatever
manpower is required will be provided. We are firm in our resolve to meet
the challenge of terrorism. I urge the State Governments, all political
parties, civil society groups and social and religious leaders to cooperate
with us in rooting out terrorism from our country.

Brothers and Sisters,

I am confident that we will overcome these challenges. But this requires
hard work and unity of purpose. This requires a politics of consensus, not
confrontation. This requires dialogue among communities, not discord. The
challenge of communalism, of extremism and of terrorism cannot be won
by a nation divided. The challenge of environmental and ecological
destruction cannot be won by a society divided.

The challenge of economic modernization and social development of all, of
Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, of Other Backward Classes and
Minorities, cannot be won by a people divided.
Brothers and Sisters,

I have said on a number of occasions that I am greatly concerned about the
problem of regional imbalances in development. Some parts of our country
are doing much better than others. Some States are being left behind. This
pattern has persisted for far too long. We must ensure that the less
developed States catch up with the developed ones.

We must pay special attention to the development of the North-Eastern
region. Our Government has taken several initiatives to increase public
investment in the North-East and in Jammu & Kashmir. We are investing in
infrastructure and in education in these regions to encourage development
and generate employment.

Jammu & Kashmir and the North-eastern region require an era of peace for
them to catch up with the more developed parts of the country. We have
been taking various initiatives to promote peace and stability in these
States. These initiatives will be taken forward.

The recent incidents in the State of Jammu and Kashmir are a cause for
concern. In this hour of crisis, divisive politics will lead us nowhere. I appeal
to all political parties to keep the long term interests of Jammu and Kashmir
in view and come together to find a permanent solution to the problems of
the State.

The sacred shrine of Shri Amar Nath inspires all Indians to march together.
This shrine is a shining example of our secular tradition, where Hindu
pilgrims have been looked after for years by their Muslim brothers. Issues
related to this sacred place, especially the issue of providing the best
possible facilities to pilgrims, can only be resolved in an atmosphere of
peace and goodwill. Dividing people in the name of religion can complicate
these issues further which can also pose a threat to the unity and integrity
of the country. I appeal to the people of Jammu and Kashmir to cooperate
with us in establishing peace in the State. It is my conviction that all issues
can be resolved only through dialogue and peaceful means.

Brothers and Sisters,

Our ancient Himalayas are under environmental threat. If the Himalayan
glaciers recede, the flow of water in our sacred rivers will go down. Climate
change can disrupt our economy in several ways. Some of our coastal
areas could be submerged. Our monsoon pattern may change. We need
long term solutions to such threats. A national consensus is also required
for the Government to evolve effective policies to deal with these problems.

Our Government has come forward with a National Action Plan on Climate
Change. This plan shows how each of us must adapt our ways of working
and living and how we must treat our natural resources, so that our carbon
emissions remain within reasonable limits and our environment is
protected.

My fellow countrymen,

Our goal in South Asia is to seek a peaceful, stable and prosperous
neighbourhood. We seek to accelerate the pace of social and economic
development in our country and our region, while safeguarding our national
security. Our foreign policy has been based on these principles.

We wish all our neighbours well. We welcome the strengthening of
democratic forces in our neighbourhood, especially in Bhutan, Nepal and
Pakistan. The recent blasts in our Embassy in Kabul have cast a shadow
over our efforts to normalize relations with Pakistan and to bring a lasting
and honourable peace in our region. I have personally conveyed my
concern and disappointment to the Government of Pakistan.
If this issue of terrorism is not addressed, all the good intentions that we
have for our two peoples to live in peace and harmony will be negated. We
will not be able to pursue the peace initiatives we want to take. The
terrorists and those who support them are enemies of the people of India
and Pakistan, of friendship between the two countries and of peace in the
region and the world. We must defeat them.

In the last year we have strengthened our relations with the major powers,
Latin American countries, Arab countries and African countries. We will
continue our efforts in this direction, keeping in view our national interests.

India is today viewed with respect as one of the world's fastest growing
economies. People of Indian Origin are engaged in diverse activities
around the world and their capabilities are recognized the world over. Their
achievements inspire us. The world today expects India to regain its due
place in the comity of nations. This is a moment of opportunity for us.

We are rapidly marching forward to regain our rightful place in the comity of
nations. But to reach that goal we have a lot of work to do at home. We
have to overcome each of the challenges I have spoken about. We have to
forge a greater unity of purpose between various political parties, between
different communities, between all sections of our society, rich and poor.

We have to manage our natural and financial resources more prudently.
We have an obligation to our future generations. We cannot think only for
ourselves. We cannot think only about survival from day to day, from year
to year and from one election to another. We have to think about the
welfare and well-being of our children and grandchildren, their
grandchildren and future generations.

If we resolve to work together as a nation, and work hard and with
commitment to the welfare of all our people, there is nothing that we cannot
do.
Let us resolve today to stand together, to strengthen the unity and integrity
of our country and to stand firm in our determination to build a new India of
our dreams.

My dear children, please join me in saying Jai Hind

Jai Hind

Jai Hind

Jai Hind"
2007,Manmohan Singh,INC,NA,Printed from the website http://www.pmindia.nic.in,PMO Archive,http://archivepmo.nic.in/drmanmohansingh/content_print.php?nodeid=551&nodetype=2,"My dear countrymen, brothers, sisters and dear children

Today we celebrate the 60th anniversary of our Independence. My
greetings to you all on this day of national celebration.

Today we take special pride in saluting our beloved tricolor. Let us recall
with pride the great sacrifice of our freedom fighters, whose undying love
for India secured us our freedom.

On this happy occasion join me in saluting the hard work of all our citizens
who have, over these 60 years, helped build a new India. Let us bow our
head in memory of all those brave jawans and all our brave citizens who
have sacrificed their lives for the cause of our unity, integrity and progress.

Sixty years ago the people of India began a new journey as a free nation,
inspired by the message and vision of Mahatma Gandhi. But Gandhiji's
dream of a free India would only be fully realized when we banish poverty
from our midst.

As I stand here and look at our tricolor fly high and fly majestically, my
thoughts go to what I have said at these ramparts in the last three years. I
have, over these three years, outlined a new vision of a caring India:

An India that is united despite its many diversities.

An India that is not divided by caste, creed or gender.

An India in which the creativity and enterprise of every citizen can find its
full and free expression.

An India in which the weak and downtrodden are empowered, the disabled
find support, the destitute find succour and every individual is touched by
the hand of progress and development.
An India in which no person or region is left out of the journey of
development and progress.

An India in which every citizen can live a life of dignity, self- respect,
decency and hope; where every citizen feels proud to say - I am Indian!

An India that lives in peace with all neighbours and all nations.

An India that has regained its due place in the comity of nations.

This vision of India is our proud inheritance from our national movement.
We are committed to fully realizing it. We have worked hard to translate this
vision into reality, through legislative action, new programmes and new
policies. Towards this end we have vastly increased fiscal support to social
and human development.

Today, when I look back, I can say with some satisfaction that we are
undoubtedly moving forward in the right direction. We have been slow in
taking some steps; we have dithered at times, and stumbled some times.
We have had success on some fronts, and setbacks on some others. But,
there is no doubt that we have been steadfast in our resolve, firm in our
convictions and resolute in our commitment to the welfare of the common
man (aam aadmi).

We do feel a sense of satisfaction that on many fronts we have done well.
Yet, we are aware that there is much more to be done. We have moved
forward in the many battles against poverty, ignorance and disease. But
can we say we have won the war? We have been able to step up the rate
of growth. But can we say we are satisfied with the pace? Even after years
of development and rising growth rates, why have we not been able to
banish mass poverty and provide employment to all? Why do some regions
of the country continue to lag behind?
I ask these questions not to belittle our achievements, but to inspire us to
greater effort. I ask not to make you feel dispirited, but to enthuse you to
march forward.

Since Independence, our development process has empowered our
workers and farmers; it has made our citizens skilled and energetic; and,
has made our business class dynamic. They are driving higher economic
growth through their creativity and enterprise. Our economy is now growing
at historically unprecedented rates. This enables us to generate the
resources required for eradication of poverty, for education and health care
for all. Poverty eradication is now a feasible goal.

How do we translate this goal into reality? We must understand that it is
only through sustained economic growth and development that we can
banish poverty from our midst. There is no magic wand. As creativity and
enterprise blossom, new jobs are created and new incomes for new
generations of working people.

As incomes rise, so do government revenues that help finance the large
increase in public expenditure that we need for poverty eradication, for
universalisation of education and health care, for agriculture and irrigation,
and for basic infrastructure. It is such investments that help eradicate
poverty.

Over the last three years, we have significantly increased public
expenditure in the social sectors. This is in line with our commitment to the
welfare of the aam aadmi. Central Government spending on education has
been tripled. In health care, agriculture, irrigation and rural development it
has more than doubled.

This unprecedented expansion in social sector expenditure has enhanced
the welfare of our people. Through the historic National Rural Employment
Guarantee Act, we have made basic employment for 100 days a legal right.
As a result the poorest of our poor are now assured of minimum household
income. Today half the country is covered by the programme. We are
committed to implementing it across the entire country. We are confident
that this social safety net will fulfill Gandhiji's dream of antyodaya - our
humble attempt to wipe the tears of the poor.

We have kept our focus on giving a new deal to rural India. We have
doubled the supply of credit for farmers, reduced its cost and, where
farmers have been in distress, we have written off interest and rescheduled
loans. We have helped increase farmers' income by raising substantially
the support price for wheat and rice. Through Bharat Nirman, we are
investing in rural connectivity - road, electricity and telephone connectivity.
Bharat Nirman is our effort at bridging the urban rural divide.

This, I believe, is only a part of our total effort. There is more to be done
and more will be done. In the coming years our main emphasis will be on
agricultural development. We will soon launch a special programme to
invest Rs 25,000 crore in agriculture, to enhance the livelihood of our
farmers and increase food production. We will also focus on the needs of
our farmers in dry and drought prone regions. I am touring a few states to
personally review the agricultural situation across the country.

Our growing economy and population need more foodgrains. I am
confident that as we roll out our ambitious agricultural development
programme, we will see a boost in food grain production in all parts of the
country, particularly in regions untouched by the first Green Revolution.
Farmers are the backbone of our nation. Unless they prosper, the nation
cannot prosper. I reassure our farmers that their welfare lie at the core of all
our concerns.

The transformation of rural India that we seek, and the progress we seek,
are not possible unless we increase the productivity of our farms and the
income of our farmers. But, given the large population dependent on
farming and the small size of our farms, there are limits to how much
income agriculture alone can generate.

India cannot become a nation with islands of high growth and vast areas
untouched by development. Where the benefits of growth accrue only to a
few. This is good neither for our society nor for our polity.

Therefore, it is essential that we create new employment opportunities
outside of agriculture. Remember, there is no developed country today
anywhere in the world, that is not an industrial economy. Industrialization is
critical for progress.

If employment generation is the best weapon against poverty, then
industrialization is the most effective means to create new job
opportunities. In the past 60 years, many parts of our country have
benefited from industrial development. In the next decade I want to see
every region of the country to similarly benefit from the growth of modern
industry. We will pursue policies that will help in our country's rapid
industrialization.

It is true that the transition from an agrarian society to an industrial
economy has always been a difficult one. But industrialization offers new
opportunities and hope, especially for people in rural areas displaced by
agrarian change. I agree that it is the responsibility of government to
ensure that displacement does not lead to impoverishment; that those who
lose land do not lose livelihoods; and, that those who have lost employment
get better opportunities. We are, therefore, giving final shape to a National
Policy for Rehabilitation and Resettlement for all those displaced by major
projects. It is our societal obligation to ensure that the processes of
development ensure that everyone is better off, and no one is worse off.

Industrialization would also mean urbanization. As more and more people
live in urban areas, we need to have a more creative process of
urbanization. This requires greater foresight in urban planning and
development. Adequate compensation must be paid to those displaced and
urban space must be used in an economical manner. We need to have
adequate drainage facilities so that life in our cities does not come to a
standstill during heavy rains. The day is not far off when half a billion
people will be living in our cities and we need to prepare for that day.

Industrialization and urbanization will generate demand for first rate
infrastructure. The expansion and modernisation of our highways, roads,
railways and airports is visible proof of our efforts to meet this demand.
Much more is needed and will be done.

We need to do much more to generate and distribute more power, more
efficiently. Everyone should get good quality power at affordable prices. I
appeal to state governments to take this matter seriously as a weak power
situation can become a handicap in industrialization and job-creation.

For every one of our people to benefit from new employment opportunities
being created across the economy, we must ensure that every Indian is
educated and skilled. No nation can progress unless its people are
educated. We have shown our Government's commitment in this regard by
tripling public spending on education in the last three years. I request states
also to give priority to education, as education alone is the foundation on
which a progressive, prosperous society can be built. Growing revenue
earnings have improved the fiscal capacity of the States. They must now
give priority to education.

Towards this end, our Government has decided to invest in setting up good
quality schools across the country. We will support 6,000 new high quality
schools - one in every block of the country. Each such school will set
standards of excellence for other schools in the area.
As our primary education programmes achieve a degree of success, there
is growing demand for secondary schools and colleges. We are committed
to universalizing secondary education. An extensive programme for this is
being finalized.

We will also ensure that adequate numbers of colleges are set up across
the country, especially in districts where enrolment levels are low. We will
help States set up colleges in 370 such districts.

The University system, which has been relatively neglected in recent years,
is now the focus of our reform and development agenda. We will set up
thirty new Central Universities. Every state that does not have a central
university will now have one.

In order to promote science and professional education, we are setting up
five new Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research, eight new
Indian Institutes of Technology, seven new Indian Institutes of
Management, and twenty new Indian Institutes of Information Technology.
These will generate new educational opportunities for our youth. I am sure
that, working together, we can ensure that at least a fifth of our children go
to college as compared to one-tenth now.

The vast majority of our youth seek skilled employment after schooling.
Last year I spoke the need for a Vocational Education Mission. Such a
Mission is ready to be launched. We will soon launch a Mission on
Vocational Education and Skill Development, through which we will open
1600 new industrial training institutes (ITIs) and polytechnics, 10,000 new
vocational schools and 50,000 new Skill Development Centres. We will
ensure that annually, over 100 lakh students get vocational training - which
is a four-fold increase from today's level. We will seek the active help of the
private sector in this initiative so that they not only assist in the training but
also lend a hand in providing employment opportunities.
We should seek not just functional literacy, but good quality education -
education that is affordable, accessible, equitable - and available to every
boy and girl who seeks to study. For the needy we will provide more
scholarships.

I wish to see a revolution in the field of modern education in the next few
years. It is my fervent desire that India becomes a fully educated, modern,
progressive nation. From this historic Red Fort, I would like this message to
go to every corner of India - we will make India a nation of educated
people, of skilled people, of creative people.

Democracy and development mean nothing for those who are not touched
by the hand of progress. That is why, the architects of our Constitution
placed special emphasis on the empowerment of the Scheduled Castes,
Scheduled Tribes and other weaker sections of society. In 60 years, we
have seen many people climb the ladder of progress and social mobility.
Yet, there are millions who still need our support and assistance.

We are committed to the economic, social, political and educational
empowerment of SCs, STs, OBCs and minorities. Apart from effective
implementation of all existing reservations for them, we have announced
major scholarship and development programmes for their benefit. I am
happy to say that we have been able to persuade the private sector to
some extent to take affirmative action to ensure that these sections of
society get a fair share of employment in industry and trade.

We have ensured that our tribal brethren get rights over land that they have
cultivated for generations in forest areas. This should provide them a sense
of security. The Prime Minister's 15-Point Programme is designed to
ensure that Minorities are not left out of development programmes and that
they have the necessary resources to transform their lives.

I also affirm our commitment to the welfare and well being of people with
disabilities of various kinds, as well as our senior citizens for whom all of us
have a special place in our heart and mind. We have set up the National
Commission for Protection of Child Rights to ensure that children are safe
and well cared for.

The problem of malnutrition is a matter of national shame. We have tried to
address it by making the mid-day meal universal and massively expanding
the anganwadi system. However, success requires sustained effort at the
grassroots. Infants need to be breast-fed, have access to safe drinking
water and health care. We need the active involvement of the community
and panchayats to see that what we spend reaches our children. I appeal
to the nation to resolve and work hard to eradicate malnutrition within five
years.

While we have moved ahead in the last three years on many fronts, there is
one area where considerable work remains to be done. Millions of our
fellow citizens are not engaged in any formal employment in the organized
sector. They work in small establishments, run their own little shops or offer
their services on a daily basis. They have neither a social safety net nor a
sense of economic security. They become destitute or indebted when they
fall ill or suffer accidents. We are committed to their welfare and are taking
steps to provide this sense of security.

We will provide an old age pension to all citizens above the age of 65 and
living below the poverty line. We will also provide life and disability cover to
the heads of all poor families or to one earning member in each family so
that they and their families can get over the consequences of injury or
death. We are also working on a health insurance model so that our poor
do not have to bear the high cost of medical care. These programmes will
be launched shortly.

There are many less developed regions in the country that must also
benefit from development and economic growth. It is necessary to increase
investment in backward areas to improve the regional balance in
development. Towards this end, we have created the Backward Regions
Grant Fund covering 250 districts. Over a period of time, these funds and
our other initiatives will see that these regions catch up with other parts of
the country. Every State, every district, every village, every person must be
touched by the hand of progress.

In the rush of modernization and the race to develop we must not forget the
value of conserving our resources. Water is one such scarce resource. I
want each and every citizen to pay special attention to water conservation
and to how we store and use water.

I urge states to look upon water as a national asset and work to resolve
inter-state disputes over water sharing with an attitude of give and take. It is
only through a cooperative approach that lasting solutions can be found to
recurring problems, like floods and drought. We should work together to
prevent the destruction caused by the ravages of nature, like floods.

In protecting our environment let us recall Gandhiji's wise words that nature
has given us enough for everyone's need, but not for everyone's greed.
The Himalayas are part of our inheritance. Many of our rivers flow from
them. We must protect our glaciers; we must keep our rivers clean and
must increase our forest cover. Every citizen must ensure that our wildlife,
especially endangered species like tigers, lions and elephants are
preserved for the benefit of future generations. Keeping India green and
clean should be a national and an individual obsession.

Each one of us must be aware of how what we do impacts on nature and
our climate. People across the world are increasingly concerned about
global warming. And so must we be. We must be economical in our
consumption of fuels and energy. This we owe humanity and to posterity.

The land from which the message first went out that the whole world is one
family (Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam) must set an example for the rest of the
world in finding collective solutions to global problems.

I also want our young people to actively associate themselves with a
""National Campaign for Cleanliness"" in our neighbourhoods, in public
places and markets, in villages and slums. Let us all take that one extra
step to ensure that we live in clean and healthy surroundings. Each one of
us can make a difference by practicing what we preach. As Gandhiji used
to say, we must be the change we want to see.

In implementing our strategy of inclusive growth, State Governments,
Panchayati Raj Institutions and Urban Local Bodies have a crucial role to
play. They must play an active role in mobilizing both resources and people
for development. As Shri Rajiv Gandhi used to say, Panchayats must be
actively associated with social development at the grassroots. They must
ensure public participation in development programmes and proper
functioning of our schools and hospitals.

To make the government, at all levels, more accountable and more
transparent, and to fight the cancer of corruption, we had introduced the
Right to Information Act. I want every citizen to make full use of this act to
ensure that government functions properly and honestly.

In our quest for a caring, sharing and an inclusive society, we must develop
the spirit of good neighbourliness with all people, irrespective of caste,
creed or language. Our strength lies in our unity in diversity. Those who
profess hatred and extremism, those who spread the virus of communalism
and those who believe in violence and terrorism have no place in our
society. We must all fight these anti-democratic, anti-social and
anti-national forces, each in our own way, in our daily lives. Let there be no
doubt in anyone's mind that the Government is firm in its resolve to fight all
forms of extremism and terrorism.
We want to bring greater prosperity to the less developed regions of our
country, especially the North-Eastern region and Jammu and Kashmir. This
is our solemn commitment. Our State governments must be more active in
creating an environment conducive to investment.

We are investing in better infrastructure and connectivity in the
North-eastern States. In Jammu & Kashmir, our long-term development
plan is bringing new investment to all the three regions of the State.
Grassroots democracy has taken deep roots in the State and the
Roundtable discussions have opened new avenues for reconciliation and
development.

Our greatest achievement over the past 60 years has been the fact that we
have built the firm foundations of an open society and an open economy.
As a multi-cultural, secular democracy and home to all the great religions of
the world, we feel proud to be Indian. And the world has come to view this
with regard.

The success of a secular democracy in a nation of a billion people with
such diversity is viewed with admiration. This great idea of India as a
symbol of unity in diversity is increasingly viewed with respect and regard.
Our tolerance, our capacity to assimilate and our ability to reconcile the
irreconcilable are objects of wonder. The world wants us to do well. Our
challenges lie at home.

India wants to have good relations with all the countries of the world. Big
and small. Countries of the East and the West, the North and the South.
Today, we enjoy good relations with all major powers and all developing
countries. We have emerged as a bridge between the many extremes of
the world. Our composite culture is living proof of the possibility of a
confluence of civilizations. India will always be a nation bridging the many
global divides.
India wants to live in a neighbourhood of peace and prosperity. I assure all
our neighbours that we in India want peace and the best of relations with all
of them. I sincerely believe that in the prosperity and well-being of our
neighbours lies the key to our own security and progress.

We are a young nation. More importantly, we are a nation of young people.
Once unleashed, the energy of our youth will drive India onto a new growth
path. I assure you that for each one of you, and for our country, the best is
yet to come.

However, we must not be over-confident. We have a long march ahead.
We need at least a decade of hard work and of sustained growth to realize
our dreams. We have to bridge the many divides in our society and work
with a unity of purpose. We need to think of the future and be steadfast in
our resolve to march forward. We must capitalize the dynamism that
pervades our people, our youth, our farmers, our businesses,

We must have faith in our strength and confidence in our capabilities. Each
of us have our individual identities. However, every citizen must recognize
that we are Indians first and last. We fritter away our time on petty issues
and pointless personal differences. I urge all political parties, all political
and social leaders to resist the temptation to divide people along narrow,
sectarian lines. Our strength is in our unity, despite our diversity. It is that
unity which gave us our Independence. It is that unity that gives us our
strength as a nation.

This was the dream of our founding fathers. This was the vision of our
Constitution. We should not move away from this vision, and must face the
future with courage. However, as Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru said from these
ramparts nearly sixty years ago, ""laws and constitutions do not by
themselves make a country great. It is the enthusiasm, energy and
constant effort of a people that make it a great nation.""
Let us all come together and work resolutely for the welfare of our people
and for the development of our nation.

Jai Hind!"
2006,Manmohan Singh,INC,NA,Printed from the website http://www.pmindia.nic.in,PMO Archive,http://archivepmo.nic.in/drmanmohansingh/content_print.php?nodeid=353&nodetype=2,"My dear countrymen, brothers, sisters, and dear children

My greetings to all of you on this day, the anniversary of our Independence

1. Today is an auspicious day for our country. Today we enter the 60th
year of our Independence. Today we re-dedicate ourselves to the progress
and prosperity of our nation. To the welfare of all our people. To the unity
and integrity of our country.

2.     Today we salute our beloved tricolor. We pay tribute to Mahatma
Gandhi and all those freedom fighters because of whose efforts and
sacrifices we secured our Independence. We remember all those whose
hard work and efforts keep our flag flying high and keep our country on the
road to progress. We pay tribute to the brave members of our armed
forces, farmers, teachers, scientists, workers and the millions of our
countrymen who are toiling tirelessly for the progress and prosperity of our
nation.

3.    In the early hours of the 15th of August, 1947, when our nation had
just become Independent, our first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru spoke
to the nation and asked us all one important question on the very first day
we became a free country: ""Are we brave enough and wise enough to
grasp this opportunity and accept the challenge of the future?""

4.    Today, my fellow citizens, I stand here once again and ask you that
same question. Are we ready to face the challenge of the future? Are we
brave enough, to do so, and wise enough, in doing so? Can we rediscover
the ideas and ideals that shaped our freedom struggle, and use them to
take our country forward into the future? Are we willing to show the courage
and the wisdom that Panditji wanted us to show in building a new India in a
new world?

My dear countrymen,
5.    The going has never been as good for India in the past as it is now.
Our economy has been growing at an impressive pace of over 8%. Such
rapid growth over three successive years is unprecedented in Indian
history. Wherever I go, I see our nation on the move. Our industry and
services sectors are showing impressive growth. I see a reassuring
confidence in our industry in being able to take on the challenge of the rest
of the world. The growth of the manufacturing industry has touched 11% in
the last quarter, generating many jobs for our youth and workers. I see our
service sector competing with the best and earning valuable foreign
exchange.

6.    All around us, we see new roads being built. The railways are
expanding their reach. New power plants are being built. New airports are
being planned. Vast industrial estates and Special Economic Zones are
coming up. This dynamism is the result of the enterprise, creativity and
hard work of millions of Indians. They are boldly taking our country into the
future, treading on untrodden paths. I am sure this will result in far greater
prosperity for our people. I sincerely believe that the most effective way to
banish poverty is to generate growth which in turn will create new
opportunities for gainful employment. Hence, economic growth is of primary
importance for us.

7.    It is almost sixty years since Independence. It is but a brief period in
the history of an ancient civilization. But, it is a long time in the life of a
young nation. In these sixty years, the world has been transformed beyond
recognition. The empires of Europe have faded away. New powers have
emerged in Asia. Look at where Japan was and where it is today. Look at
where China was and where it is today. Look at where the countries of
South-east Asia were and where are they today? When I see them, I
wonder whether we are living up to our full potential or not.

8.    India is certainly on the march. Yet, we have miles to go before we
can truly say that we have made our tryst with destiny. Sixty years ago,
Panditji told us that the two challenges before a free India was to end the
ancient scourge of poverty, ignorance and disease and end the inequality
of opportunity. India has marched a great distance forward in these sixty
years, but the challenge of banishing poverty remains with us. We have yet
to banish hunger from our land. We have yet to eradicate illiteracy. We
have yet to ensure that every Indian enjoys good health.

9.     There is visible progress all around. However, when I see this, I have
some worries. And I am aware, that every Indian has similar worries. Even
as we move forward rapidly, to claim our rightful place in the comity of
nations, I see that there are vast segments of our people who are
untouched by modernization; who continue to do backbreaking labour; who
continue to suffer from iniquitous social orders. I see that our farmers in
many parts are in a crisis, not managing to eke out a decent living from
their land. When I visited Vidarbha, the plight of the farmers there made a
deep impact on me. The agricultural crisis that is forcing them to take the
desperate step of committing suicide needs to be resolved. We need to
think about how we can provide a decent livelihood to our farmers?

10. When I see large development projects coming up, while one rejoices
at the progress that is being made, one worries for those who are
displaced, for those who have lost their land and livelihood. When one sees
our cities growing rapidly, one sees visible progress but at the same time,
one worries for the large number of people who live in their slums. When
our industry and services compete successfully across the globe, we
celebrate our success in global markets; but at the same time, we are
buffeted by the same global forces when oil prices go up because of factors
beyond our control. Globalisation certainly has its benefits; but it can also
hurt the common man.

11. The challenge for us as a nation is to address this duality - to ensure
that while we keep the wheels of progress moving rapidly forward, no
section of society and no part of the country is left behind; to ensure that
growth generates the necessary wealth which can then finance the welfare
of marginalized groups; to ensure that growth generates employment and a
bright future for our youth.

12. In the past two years, it has been our endeavour to address these
concerns. We have taken many steps to expand employment opportunities
and improve the quality of life in rural and urban areas.

13. The National Rural Employment Guarantee Act has been enacted to
provide income security for those suffering from extreme poverty. The
programmes under this Act, for which more than 2 crore families have
already registered, currently cover 200 districts and will be expanded
gradually to cover the entire country. This pathbreaking Act is the most
important social safety net for our poor. I am confident that this Act will help
us in eradicating poverty.

14. Bharat Nirman is another programme which will modernize our
villages. As our villages get fully electrified and get connected by roads and
telephones, their economies will prosper. As they get better irrigation
facilities, their agriculture will grow. As drinking water and housing facilities
improve, their living conditions will improve. They will participate in the
growth which is already visible in urban India. I am happy that progress in
the first year of Bharat Nirman has been good and by 2009, I expect to see
visible results across the country.

15. These programmes are our weapons in the ""War on Poverty"". The
most effective weapon against poverty is employment. And, higher
economic growth is the best way to generate employment. We must create
an environment that encourages business to grow and create more
employment, especially in the manufacturing sector. We have created a
conducive environment for our industrial enterprises to flourish and the
results of this are visible. We are supporting not just large industries, but
also the labour intensive small scale and handloom sectors through special
programmes. Handlooms and textile industries employ over 3.5 crore
people. We are giving cheaper loans to this sector and handloom
cooperatives are being revitalised. I am hopeful that in the coming years,
lakhs of jobs will be generated in these sectors.

My dear countrymen

16. Two years ago, speaking from the Red Fort, I promised a ""New Deal
for Rural India"". There is much we have done, but I know much more needs
to be done. We have kept our word and almost doubled agricultural credit
in less than three years as promised. We are providing short term loans to
farmers at 7%. We have waived interest on over-due loans for
debt-stressed farmers in Vidarbha and will do the same in other suicide
affected districts. We are trying to reach institutional credit to each and
every farmer so that they are out of the clutches of moneylenders. For this,
we are reviving the cooperative banking system for which a Rs 13,000
crore package is being implemented. We have been paying special
attention to horticulture, animal husbandry, cotton, sugarcane and other
crops. A National Fisheries Development Board has been set up for
increasing the livelihood of fishermen. Agricultural research is being
improved and Krishi Vigyan Kendras will soon be functioning in every
district of the country by the year end.

17. However, I admit that much still needs to be done to improve the
prospects for farmers. Especially in rain-fed areas and for dry-land
agriculture. We will need to work towards ensuring more remunerative
prices for our farmers. I am aware of the acute distress of our farmers who
bear the burden of heavy debt. We have recently constituted an expert
group to look into the problem of agricultural indebtedness. I am confident
that in a few months, we will take concrete measures to help our farmers
overcome the burden of crushing debt. Most importantly, we must ensure
that more people get employment in manufacturing and services so that the
disproportionate burden on agriculture in providing a livelihood to two-thirds
of our population gets reduced.

18. The results of our efforts to improve agriculture are clearly visible in
some places. Farmers are getting better prices for many crops. This helps
them earn a better livelihood. This, on the other hand hurts the common
man when the prices of essential food commodities go up. We need to
understand that if we want better prices for farmers so that they earn a
better livelihood, the prices of what they produce and sell will have to go
up! We certainly cannot grudge our farmers better incomes when incomes
of other sections of society are rising! In order to ensure that the needy and
the poor do not get adversely affected, our government is committed to
ensuring adequate availability of essential commodities at affordable prices
to them.

Brothers and Sisters,

19. I know that each of our families is concerned about the prices of
essential commodities. Let me assure you that we will do whatever is
required to keep prices under check. But I must remind you that two years
ago the international price of oil was just over $30 per barrel. Today it is
close to $75. Even though world oil prices have more than doubled, we
have succeeded in insulating our consumers to a great extent. Prices of
kerosene and LPG have not been raised. But there is a limit to which we
can go on subsidizing the consumption of petroleum products in the face of
rising import costs. How much more can the government treasury bear this
burden? At some point, this will affect our ability to spend on other
important development programmes. In order to keep food prices within the
reach of the common man, we have even allowed the import of some
products to meet the shortage in our markets.

Brothers and sisters,
20. While employment and agriculture are of immediate concern to all,
our long term concern is for the future of our children. They need to be
healthy, well educated, with hope for the future. We launched the National
Rural Health Mission to provide better health care in rural areas. Under this
programme, almost 2 lakh women have been kept as health assistants
(ASHAs) at the village level; 4 lakh more women will be in place soon.
Through them, we will wage a war against malnutrition of children, against
malaria, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS and other diseases. These diseases put a
heavy financial burden on our people. In Vidarbha, I was pained to meet
families of farmers who had committed suicide because they could not
repay the loans they had taken to meet the cost of health care of their loved
ones. We will take every possible step to help people overcome the burden
of poverty and disease.

21. The expanded Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan will ensure that all our children
go to school. Under the universal Mid-day Meal Programme, almost 12
crore children are getting a nutritious meal at school. Through these two
programmes, we will ensure that all our children complete basic schooling.
I request every citizen to ensure that every child of school-going age is
enrolled in a school. We will pay particular attention to the empowerment
through education of children belonging to Scheduled Castes, Scheduled
Tribes and Minorities. We will provide all possible assistance for the all
round growth of children suffering from disabilities or with special needs.
We also will care for those who suffer from disabilities so that they can lead
a dignified life in society.

22. All the initiatives that we have taken to push forward rural
development and ensure farmers' welfare can be implemented only with
the active participation of our panchayats. For this to happen, our State
Governments have to empower our panchayats. We have to pay more
attention to the quality of local administration - in our villages and districts,
in our towns and cities. We need to rid our municipalities of the cancer of
corruption. State governments have a major role to play in this.
Brothers and sisters,

23. Cities and towns are centers of growth and generators of employment
opportunities. Our cities need to have a new look for which they need
massive investment and renewal. They need basic amenities like
sanitation, drinking water and proper housing for the poor. They need
public transport, parks and playgrounds. We need cities in which the
working poor can live with self-respect and dignity; cities in which children
and women feel safe and secure. In order to ensure that our cities have
better infrastructure and that they have better living conditions, we
launched the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission. This
programme and other similar ones have started showing results. Work has
begun on Metro systems in Bangalore and Mumbai. I see a glorious
decade of city development ahead of us.

24. The challenge before Government is to implement these
programmes. We have to improve the way governments function and
deliver public services. How do we do this? How do we ensure that higher
financial outlays translate into better outcomes? I sincerely hope that the
Right to Information Act enacted by our Government will empower our
people who will be able to use their rights to make government more
accountable. We have to work hard to eliminate corruption in the delivery of
public services, in fact eliminate it from all walks of life. We will work to put
in place a system that rewards honesty, probity and efficiency.

Brothers and sisters

25. India has contributed extensively to human knowledge. Today, we
are at the dawn of a new millennium which many call the knowledge
economy. In this world, knowledge will determine our progress and the
place we occupy in the world. We must continue to be at the forefront of
new research and new thinking, especially in science and technology. We
must build top-class institutions. We have begun work on three new Indian
Institutes of Science, Education and Research in Kolkata, Pune and
Punjab. We have also begun work on 19 medical institutions of the same
standard as AIIMS. We will need to ensure far greater availability of
educational opportunities at the higher education level so that we have not
just a literate youth but a skilled youth, with skills which can fetch them
gainful employment. As our economy booms and as our industry grows, I
hear a pressing complaint about an imminent shortage of skilled
employees. As a country endowed with huge human resources, we cannot
let this be a constraint. We are planning to launch a Mission on Vocational
Education so that the skill deficit in our economy is addressed.

26. As we expand educational opportunities, we must ensure that these
opportunities are accessible to all marginalized and weaker sections of our
society. Our government is committed to providing reservation in
educational institutions for students from socially backward sections of
society. We will do so, while at the same time expanding educational
opportunities for all youth. This is our solemn commitment. In this manner,
we will recognize and reward individual merit and hard work while working
for an inclusive society.

27. While we are moving fast to develop every region of our country, we
have to take pains to see that this does not adversely affect those who are
displaced. Nor should it affect our environment. Nor should any region of
the country get left behind. Our government will soon put in place a
comprehensive Rehabilitation Policy so that displacement does not lead to
impoverishment and those who lose their land benefit from subsequent
economic development. We have also taken special measures to save our
wildlife, including the tiger. We are taking concrete steps to develop
backward regions through the Backward Regions Grant Fund and will be
spending Rs 5000 crores annually in 250 districts.

My dear countrymen
28. Our other concern is national security. India is facing two major
threats to its internal security. Terrorism and Naxalism. Just over a month
ago, Mumbai witnessed the most inhuman terrorist attack in the recent
past, killing and injuring hundreds of innocent citizens. The entire nation
was pained by this suffering. Mumbai demonstrated its courage and
patience and showed its resolve not to be cowed down by these incidents.

29. I had said in Mumbai then that it cannot be business as usual for any
of us. Terrorists want to undermine our growing economic strength; destroy
our unity; and provoke communal incidents. We cannot allow this to
happen. Our strength lies in our unity. We will not allow the secular fabric of
our country to be broken.

30. I give my assurance to every citizen that we will do our utmost to
preserve our unity and integrity, to make our country safe and secure for
every citizen. We will modernize, strengthen and properly equip our
security forces and our intelligence agencies. We will leave no stone
unturned in ensuring that terrorist elements in India are neutralized and
smashed. Let those who want to hurt us by inflicting a thousand cuts
remember - no one can break our will, or unity. No one can make India
kneel.

31. While terrorism has been raising its ugly head time and again, we
have also seen peace having its victories. The people of Jammu and
Kashmir continue to face the wrath of terrorism. But they have also seen
new rays of hope for peace and progress. New links of connectivity have
brought people on both sides of the Line of Control closer - Srinagar to
Muzaffarabad, Poonch to Rawalkot. Through the Round Table
Conferences, we have started a dialogue with all political groups and
parties of Jammu and Kashmir. We are jointly exploring new pathways to
build a better tomorrow for its people - a tomorrow where they can live in
peace and dignity, free from fear, want and exploitation.
32. Today the people of the North-Eastern region look to the future with
hope. The last two years have seen immense progress in the North East in
all spheres of development - better roads, better rail connectivity, the first
ever thermal power projects in the region and better universities. I am
hopeful that in the coming few years, the North-eastern region will gradually
catch up with the rest of the country. However, many states here are still
afflicted by insurgency. There is a great desire among the people of the
region for peace and tranquility. While we are determined to tackle
insurgency, we are hopeful that the dialogue that we have initiated with
many disaffected groups will produce a peace dividend. A life of progress
and prosperity with self-respect and dignity is the right of the people there
and we are confident of providing it.

33. I want those who have mistakenly taken to Naxalism to understand
that in democratic lndia, power will never flow from the barrel of a gun. Real
power flows from the ballot box. At the same time, our State Governments
must pay special attention to the welfare of our tribals and small and
marginal farmers. It is their distress that Naxalites exploit. The path of
violence can never solve the problems of the poor. Our security forces will
respond appropriately to the violence unleashed by Naxalites.

34. In the past one month, many parts of the country, particularly Andhra
Pradesh, Surat and Maharashtra, have been badly affected by floods and
there has been extensive loss of life and property. We will provide all
possible assistance for the relief of these regions.

Brothers and Sisters,

35. Every Indian wants to live in a neighbourhood of peace, stability and
prosperity. People in our neighbouring countries share the same
aspirations. South Asia is a common cultural and economic unit. Our past
and destinies are inter-linked. India, as the largest country in the region, is
ready to give our neighbours a stake in our own prosperity and share the
fruits of our growth with them. However, the dream of a South Asian
community, where borders have ceased to matter and there is an
unhindered flow of goods and peoples, culture and ideas, can hardly be
realized if terrorist violence and the politics of hate and confrontation
continue to cast a dark shadow.

35. We are prepared to work together with all our neighbours to usher in
an era of peace and prosperity for our peoples. We have taken several
initiatives in this regard, in particular with Pakistan. To be successful, these
initiatives need an atmosphere of peace. It is obvious that unless Pakistan
takes concrete steps to implement the solemn assurances it has given to
prevent cross-border terrorism against India from any territory within its
control, public opinion in India, which has supported the peace process, will
be undermined. All countries in our region must recognize that terrorism
anywhere is a threat to peace and prosperity everywhere. It must be
confronted with our united efforts. There is a large constituency for peace
and shared prosperity among our people and we must work together to
build on that.

37. In the past two years, we have succeeded in creating an international
environment which supports our development aspirations. Our relations
with the United States of America, China, Japan, and the European Union,
have never been better and with Russia, we have further strengthened our
time-tested partnership. In South-East Asia, India has been welcomed into
the East Asian Summit. There has been a significant expansion of both our
political and economic links with countries of the Gulf and the Arab world.
The continents of Africa and Latin America are now the new areas of focus
for our diplomacy and India's engagement has become truly global. We are
recognized for the scale of our achievements since Independence and the
world wants India to progress.

My dear countrymen,
38. India is a young nation. India is a nation of young people. Our youth
are ready to work hard for a bright future. Our former Prime Minister, Shri
Rajiv Gandhi, was greatly concerned about the prospects for our youth and
took many steps for ensuring a bright future for them.

39. Even today, the youth of our country are in search of a bright future.
They seek new opportunities and are in search of new possibilities. They
are willing to think in new ways. They have no time for old ideas and
ideologies. They want to build a new India. We must build a new India of
their dreams. I want every one of our youth to walk shoulder to shoulder,
and walk forward with us in building a new India. Every young person must
have faith in our future. To know that this country will create opportunities
for all for the full expression of their talent and skill.

40. We have a dream of an India in which every woman can feel safe,
secure and empowered. Where our mothers, sisters and daughters are
assured a life of dignity and personal security. We must end the crime of
female foeticide. We must eliminate gender disparities. We must see that
every young woman is educated and skilled and capable of guiding a new
generation.

41. The laws of our land are meant to protect every law abiding citizen.
The rule of law can become a reality only if justice is seen to be delivered.
Only if the rights of law-abiding citizens are protected. We need a more
efficient, humane and responsive police force. We also need a more
efficient and effective judiciary. Our government will work to make this
possible.

42. Today, from this historic Red Fort, I appeal to every one of you to
re-dedicate yourself to build a new India.

-     An India that is united in thought, not divided by religion and
language.

-     An India that is united in our Indianness, not divided by caste and
region.

-     An India that is united in seeking new opportunities for growth, not
divided by disparities.

-     An India that is caring and inclusive.

43. Our religions may be different. Our castes may be different. Our
languages may be different. But we are all Indians. In our progress lies the
progress of the nation. Our fortunes and our nation's fortunes are
intertwined. And working together, we can make this fortune a glorious one.

44. If we have to fulfil our potential, we need a politics that will help us
realize it. We need a politics that will propel us forward. We need a politics
that will guide us to new frontiers, take us to new horizons. I urge all our
political leaders to think deeply about the future of our country. We must
shun the politics of divisiveness and adopt the politics of change and
progress. Our political parties and leaders must learn to work together. To
build a consensus around national issues. If we are able to do so, then I am
confident that then we will soon be able to realize the golden future which
millions of our countrymen are eagerly waiting for.

45.   Let us all join together, hand in hand, to build a new India.

Jai Hind.

Jai Hind.

Jai Hind."
2005,Manmohan Singh,INC,NA,Printed from the website http://www.pmindia.nic.in,PMO Archive,http://archivepmo.nic.in/drmanmohansingh/content_print.php?nodeid=160&nodetype=2,"My Dear Countrymen, Brothers and Sisters and Dear Children,

Today is once again a day of joy and happiness when we all gather to
celebrate the anniversary of our Independence. On this sacred occasion, I
greet you all.

Fifty eight years ago, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru had unfurled this glorious
Tricolour for the first time from this historical place, thus fulfilling the
centuries-old dream of crores of Indians to be independent from foreign
rule.

Next year, we will commence the celebrations of the 150th anniversary of
the First Battle of Independence. Through the celebrations, we will have a
chance to once again remember the glorious freedom fighters of that great
battle who had laid the foundations for our independence. In 1857,
Bahadurshah Zafar had declared the Battle for Independence from this
same historic Red Fort. The battle cry of Rani of Jhansi Lakshmi Bai,
Peshwa Nana Saheb, Tantia Tope and Begum Hazrat Mahal of Lucknow
was - ""Delhi Chalo"". This cry was renewed with vigour and force by Netaji
Subhash Chandra Bose and in 1947 this ambition was fulfilled. Today, we
have the opportunity of remembering their sacrifices. We can also learn
from their enthusiasm and self-confidence, a number of traits which will be
useful in facing today's challenges as well.

Today is a day when we feel proud of and celebrate our victory in the
struggle for independence. This is a day of joy and happiness for all
Indians, irrespective of where they reside in any part of the world. It is also
a day on which we remember our valiant soldiers and security forces, thank
them for their bravery and commitment, and hope that they will continue to
be alert in the service of the nation.

Mahatma Gandhiji had also dreamt of the same independence when he
launched the Dandi March 75 years ago. Through that struggle, he shook
the foundations of the greatest and most powerful empire the world had
ever seen. Today, we need to once again remember the sacrifice and
commitment of the Father of the Nation Mahatma Gandhi and also his
dreams for an independent nation. We also need to reflect on how far we
have been successful in fulfilling his dreams.

What was the dream Gandhiji had of an independent India? He had said, ""I
will work for an India where the poorest of the poor feel that this country
and this nation belongs to them and that they have a major role in its
construction. An India where there is no higher class or lower class among
all people. An India where all communities live in friendship and harmony.
An India where women have the same rights as men."" He had also said, ""
the Swaraj I dream of is a Swaraj of poor people. I have not the slightest
hesitation in saying that Swaraj cannot be complete till the poorest have a
guarantee of being provided with the basic necessities of life"".

Have we come anywhere near this dream? In the last one year, our attempt
has been to build the India of Gandhiji's dream. The goal of our
Government's National Common Minimum Programme is also the same.
Last year on this very day, I had said from the Red Fort that I have no
promises to make but only promises to keep. In order to fulfil the promises,
we have taken many important steps and have taken major decisions
which will contribute to our nation's progress. While taking these decisions,
the focus of our thoughts and attention has always been the aam aadmi.
The effort of our government has been that while we continue to make
rapid economic progress, the benefits of this progress and growth must
reach all sections of society in a fair manner. Our vision is not just of
economic growth, but also of a growth which would improve the life of the
aam aadmi.

Our country is witnessing unprecedented economic growth at this point in
time. Last year, our economic growth rate was 7% and it is likely to be
similar this year as well. Our country has never witnessed such consistently
high growth rates in the past. I am confident that if we maintain this
momentum of growth for the next 5?10 years, then it would be possible for
us to eradicate poverty, ignorance, hunger and disease from our country.
This is not a dream but something that is possible in our times.

It is not only us but the entire world, which is viewing India as an emerging
power of these times. The whole world is eagerly watching the manner in
which India is making rapid economic progress. And this economic growth
is happening within the framework of a liberal democracy. Our country is a
multi-cultural, multi-religious, multi-lingual and multi-ethnic nation. Nowhere
in the world do we have an example of a country of a 100 crore people
seeking their economic and social destiny within the framework of a
democracy. It is because of this that the entire world's attention is riveted
on us. It is the result of our combined hard work that India today has made
its mark on the world stage and we feel proud of our standing in the comity
of nations.

Brothers and Sisters,

It is my belief that India's future is extremely bright and that this future is
indeed, possible. In order to achieve this, we need to focus on achieving
rapid economic growth and on ensuring social justice. It is only by walking
on these two legs will we be able to ensure that the benefits of growth
reach all sections of society.

Last year, while addressing the nation on this day, I had mentioned that our
growth is critically dependent on seven sectors which I called the 'Saat
Sutras'. These seven sectors were - agriculture, irrigation, education,
health, employment, urban renewal and infrastructure. Today, we can
review the progress made in these seven areas.

Our maximum emphasis has been on agriculture. Farmers are the
backbone of our country and of our economy. It is the result of their tireless
efforts that we do not have any shortage of foodgrains in our country. The
entire country is grateful to them for this.

We must admit that the economic growth we have been referring to earlier
has not yet fully reached every individual in our society. This is particularly
true in our rural areas. The growth in agriculture has not been at the
required pace. Even today, over 60% of our population is dependent on
agriculture and every farmer has a right to be a participant in our economic
growth processes. Hence, we have talked about giving a 'new deal' to our
farmers. We have taken a number of steps to alleviate the problems of our
farmers, such as improving and enhancing the flow of agricultural credit,
increasing investment opportunities and storage facilities, launching a
National Horticulture Mission to increase the output and trade in fruits and
vegetables, and promoting research and training in agriculture. It is our
goal that by 2007, there should be a Krishi Vigyan Kendra in every district.
Through this, the benefits of advanced research and training will reach all
our rural brethren. Large parts of our country are still dependent on rainfall
and we will focus on removing the problems of farmers in dry land areas.
We are considering setting up a National Rainfed Area Authority for this
purpose. It is our hope that in the coming years, agricultural growth
becomes rapid and we have a new green revolution. We are fully
committed to achieving this.

It is not possible for our rural areas to develop in the absence of basic
infrastructural facilities. In order to improve basic infrastructure in rural
areas, we have conceived an ambitious programme called 'Bharat Nirman'.
In Bharat Nirman, one crore hectares of unirrigated land will be irrigated. All
villages whose population is 1000 or more, and 500 or more in hilly areas,
will be connected with roads. Two and a half crore houses will be given
electricity connections, and through this, the entire country will be
electrified. Over 60 lakh houses will be built in villages. The remaining
74,000 habitations which do not have access to safe drinking water will be
provided these facilities. Each and every village will have at least one
telephone connection. I am confident that Bharat Nirman will ensure the
rapid economic development of our rural areas.

In all our economic programmes, our policy has been to ensure the
participation of the common man, particularly of those in rural areas. They
should feel that all programmes belong to them. We have believed that the
proper institutional mechanism to ensure their participation in the
Panchayat system. Shri Rajiv Gandhiji had dreamt of Panchayati Raj many
years ago. Today, zila, tehsil and village panchayats have a major
responsibility to discharge. Our Constitution has placed the responsibility
on panchayats, not only of ensuring economic development but also
delivering social justice. Bharat Nirman provides a unique opportunity to
our panchayats to shoulder this immense responsibility by effectively
implementing this programme. I am confident that panchayats will ensure
Bharat Nirman becomes a milestone in our development process.

We are giving importance not only to our rural areas but also to the
economic conditions in our urban areas. Today, a third of our population
lives in urban areas and keeping in mind the speed at which urbanization is
taking place, the day is not far off when over 50% of India's population will
be residing in urban areas. The foundations of our culture and society were
laid thousands of years ago in the cities on the banks of Indus River. We
taught the world the basic concepts of urban planning. However, today our
cities are often unable to meet the basic needs of their residents on many
counts. We will be investing in urban areas and for this, a National Urban
Renewal Mission has been launched.

We have a large proportion of young people in our population. We will need
to invest in their education and health so that their future prospects are
bright. By doing so, our population will become our biggest asset.

It is necessary for every section of society to be literate and educated so
that they can take advantage of our growth processes. By strengthening
Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, we are trying to ensure universalisation of primary
education. We are giving special emphasis to the education of the girl child.
We need to make education joyful, interesting and meaningful so that
children develop a desire to go to school. We need to pay particular
attention to the education of first generation learners. We are resolute in
our commitment to see that no child is deprived of the benefit of primary
education. It is our hope that in the near future, women are as literate as
men. In order to achieve these goals, resources shall not be a constraint.
We are also committed to providing education to disabled children as well.

Along with primary education, we also need to pay attention to higher
education. If India is seen around the world as a rising knowledge power, it
is because of our Universities and Research Institutions. If we want to
maintain our rapid economic growth, we need to improve the quality of
these institutions and also create many more such institutions. Let us
resolve to achieve excellence in academic work in the 150th anniversary
year of the Universities of Kolkata, Mumbai and Chennai.

However educated an individual may be, it is necessary for the person to
be healthy in order to lead a happy life. Through the National Rural Health
Mission, we will provide the best primary health care facilities in each and
every village. We are confident that by providing excellent primary health
care, we will be able to improve the health of young mothers and children
which will then lead to a consequent reduction in our population growth
rate.

In the last fifty years, we have been able to control and eliminate many
diseases which have been a scourge in our country. Leprosy has been
eliminated in 25 states. Polio and T.B. are also being gradually brought
under control. AIDS is now becoming a major national problem and we
need to tackle this on a war-footing. We need to have a mass movement to
ensure that this disease is rapidly checked and its growth arrested. We will
also ensure that medicines are available to common people at reasonable
prices.

As I had mentioned earlier, the true test of development is the number of
people who have secured employment and the number of families who
have prospered as a result. As long as there is widespread unemployment
in the country, we cannot claim that we are truly independent. It is with this
goal in mind that Smt. Indira Gandhi had given the nation the goal of 'Garibi
Hatao'. Today, if we need to remove poverty, we need to create
employment ""Rozgar Badhao"". In order to ensure that a minimum level of
employment is available to everyone in rural areas, it is necessary to have
an employment guarantee. The National Rural Employment Guarantee Bill
has been prepared with this goal in mind. We hope that this Act will bring
about a revolutionary change in the lives of people in rural India. We are
also revamping the Khadi and Village Industries Commission so that more
employment is generated through small and village industries.

In order to ensure that our economic growth does not slow down, it is
necessary to have strong infrastructure. Economic growth is intrinsically
linked to the availability of infrastructure. Railways, roads and electricity are
important elements of infrastructure. In order to improve our railways, a rail
modernization programme has been prepared so that our railways become
one of the best in the world. A dedicated freight corridor is being developed
between Delhi-Kolkata and Delhi-Mumbai by investing over Rs. 25,000
crore rupees.

The development of our national highways is progressing at a rapid pace.
We have begun work on an additional 30,000 km of highways and we will
soon be six-laning the Golden Quadrilateral. There has been tremendous
progress in civil aviation. World class airports are being constructed in
many cities. Ports are being modernized and many new ports are under
construction.

Shortage of electricity is still a major inconvenience. Electricity is an
essential ingredient of economic development. We need to ensure that
electricity generation grows rapidly and that power shortages are
eliminated. We need far greater investment in this sector. I have often said
that, excepting for the poorest sections of society, giving electricity free of
cost to other sections will worsen the financial condition of our electric
utilities. We need to get used to paying a reasonable price for electricity just
as we do for petroleum products. Through this, we can ensure supply of
electricity in the right quantity, at the right time and of right quality. In my
visit to the United States, we have managed to reduce some of the
constraints which have been hampering the growth of our nuclear energy
programme and in the next 10 years, in addition to the 1,50,000 MW of
capacity being added in the thermal and hydro sectors, another 40,000 MW
could be generated through nuclear energy.

While rapid economic growth is one facet of our vision for the nation, social
justice and equitable development is the other facet. Last year, our greatest
contribution to the nation has been to bring it back on the path of rapid
economic growth. There is a ray of hope in the lives of all weaker sections
of society. There is an atmosphere of calm, peace and communal harmony
all around the country. We believe that this is an important achievement.

In our country, scheduled castes, scheduled tribes, backward classes and
women suffer from many disabilities. Many of them have been
discriminated against for centuries. It is essential that they are made
stakeholders and participants in our development processes. We are
committed to paying attention to their education, health and basic
necessities. We have taken some steps to improve their economic and
social status. A Bill has been introduced in Parliament on reservation in
government employment. It will be our effort now to increase the
opportunities for employment and equal opportunities in employment
outside Government.

Our Adivasi brothers have been cultivating land near forests for many
generations. However, they do not have any rights on this land owing to
which they live in constant fear of eviction. Their rights were snatched away
from them 150 years ago during British rule. In order to correct this, we are
bringing a legislation which will benefit scheduled tribes living in forests
while at the same time ensuring conservation of our natural heritage.

Our Constitution provides for equality of all religions. All religions are safe
and secure within our Republic. It is essential that minorities should have
every opportunity of carrying on their daily activities with a feeling of
security and happiness. This is also our goal. Hence we have repealed
POTA. As a result, many sections of society are able to breathe easy. We
have commissioned a report on the social economic status of minorities.
This is being done for the first time and will be the basis for all our policy
interventions for improving their status. We will also revive and revamp the
15 Point Programme for Minorities. The New 15 Point Programme will have
definite goals which are to be achieved in a specific time frame.

We are going to start a special development programme which will focus
on the skill enhancement of artisans and weavers, many of whom are
minorities. This will help improve their incomes.

Industrial growth is the result of the sweat and toil of our working classes.
This year, our industrial growth in May has exceeded 10%. I would like to
congratulate all our workers for this magnificent result. The Government will
pay specific attention towards addressing the problems of workers,
particularly those in the unorganized sector. It is our hope that we will be
able to provide a social security net for them so that they do not feel
insecure in times of distress. However, I would like to emphasize that
workers too have a responsibility. Wherever they may be working, in
factories or in firms, they should work in cooperation with the management
so that profitability of enterprises increases and they also benefit from this.

Women are the backbone not only of our homes but also of our nation. We
need to strengthen their hands and empower them fully. We have brought
legislation to prevent domestic violence against women and to secure their
property rights. We will also ensure reservation for women in Parliament
and Legislative Assemblies.

In order to provide an opportunity for our youth and sportspersons to
demonstrate their skills, we will make all possible efforts to ensure that
India once again hosts the Asian Games in Delhi, the first since 1982.

In this new phase of development, we are acutely aware that all regions of
the country should develop at the same pace. It is unacceptable for us to
see any region of the country left behind other regions in this quest for
development. In every scheme of the Government, we will be making all
efforts to ensure that backward regions are adequately taken care of. This
has been ensured in the Food for Work Programme and the National Rural
Health Mission. We will also focus on the development of our border areas.
We will ensure that these regions are provided basic infrastructure such as
roads, electricity and telephone connectivity in the next 3 - 4 years.

Our rivers are the lifelines of the country. They are the foundations of our
ancient civilization. Today the demand for water is growing all around. In
the 21st century, water will the most precious commodity and its shortage
will be felt all around. We need to launch a national movement to prevent
the wastage of water and for its efficient use. This is an absolute necessity.
It is also necessary that all states of our country work together in a spirit of
give and take and a spirit of mutual understanding to sort out all
contentious issues amicably so that everyone is benefited.

We also need to pay special attention to our environment. We need to start
a national campaign for cleanliness - so that our cities, towns, villages,
roads, streets and homes are neat and clean. Gandhiji used to emphasise
this aspect in his Ashram as well. We need to stop the pollution of our
rivers and atmosphere. We need to protect our forests and natural heritage.
We must remember that we are only the custodians of our environment and
it is our responsibility to preserve and pass it on to our future generations.

In the recent past, natural calamities have affected many parts of our
country with disastrous effects on people and property. A tsunami in
December, snowfall in January and floods in July. Lot of people have lost
their precious lives in these calamities. The entire nation's sympathies are
with the bereaved families. I am confident that we will face the problems of
floods in a united manner, just we faced the devastation caused by the
tsunami. Last month, Mumbai suffered immense damage and lost many
lives because of unprecedented floods. In these difficult circumstances, the
citizens of Mumbai have shown courage fortitude and patience in dealing
with the enormous problems and have demonstrated the qualities which
make Mumbai different from other cities. I would like to assure that we will
provide whatever assistance is required to ensure that Mumbai,
Maharashtra, Gujarat and Karnataka are restored to normalcy. In order to
effectively tackle such natural calamities, we have constituted a National
Disaster Management Authority. Through this, and by using the latest
technologies, we hope to face future calamities in a much better manner.

In the country, we still have regions such as Jammu & Kashmir and the
North-East where complete peace and tranquility does not exist. The
people in these regions are the victims of violence and terrorism. Wherever
conditions deteriorate we take the assistance of our Armed Forces.
Wherever we have taken their assistance, they have shown patience and
perseverance. Many of them have lost their lives. In order to ensure that
the children of soldiers who have laid down their lives in the service of the
nation get good education, we are starting a Prime Minister's Scholarship
Scheme. Each year, 5000 children would be provided scholarships for
college education.

However, accidents do happen once in a while. Keeping this in mind and
with a view to protecting human rights, the Government had set up a
Committee to look into the provisions of the Armed Forces Special Powers
Act. The Report of this Committee is being examined in detail and we will
take all necessary steps so that there are no violations of human rights
under this Act.

As a result of our policy in Jammu & Kashmir, the State is once again on
the path of peace and progress. It is our humanitarian obligation that we
assist the State in all possible ways so that the people there can live in
peace and harmony. Terrorists have never been the friends of the people
of Kashmir. As long as they continue their terrorist attacks, our Armed
Forces will be alert and give them a fitting response. In this conflict,
common citizens may also be affected at times. I have said before and I am
repeating once again, that there is no issue that cannot be resolved
through a process of discussion and dialogue. Our doors are always open
and will continue to be open for anyone interested in dialogue. I invite
everyone to join us to discuss the problems of the state of Jammu &
Kashmir so that its people can lead a life of peace and dignity. If violence
continues, then our response too will be hard. I am aware that the
Government of Pakistan has put some checks on the activities of terrorists
from its soil. However, it is not possible to achieve success through
half-hearted efforts. It is necessary that the entire infrastructure of terrorism
is totally dismantled.

In the context of terrorism and extremism, development and security have
an intrinsic relationship. We have managed to face extremism successfully
through a democratic process. However, it is imperative that a democratic
government should be able to differentiate between the genuine problems
of people and the designs of terrorists. Today, there are a number of
challenges in our security environment such as terrorism, communal
violence, atrocities on women and exploitation of dalits and adivasis. Our
security forces have been facing the daunting task of controlling extremist
violence admirably. Extremism is a challenge which requires a united
response from all of us. However, it is also necessary to look at a political
resolution of this problem. Often extremism has its roots in backwardness
and lack of economic development. It is not easy to handle problem of
extremism in violation. However, by addressing it in all its dimensions -
social, political, economic and security - in an integrated manner, I am
confident that we will be successful in checking it.

India has always been a country which loves peace. Its destiny is
intrinsically linked to those of its neighbours. Our goal has always been the
prosperity and happiness of our citizens. Hence, we have always sought
the friendship of our neighbours, although at times, this has not been fully
successful. There seems to be some success in our search for peace and
harmony now. Many problems of South Asia are similar, of which poverty
and illiteracy are the most widespread. It is possible for us to eliminate
these in the region by working together.

The composite dialogue process with Pakistan is continuing. As a result,
we have been able to reopen the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad highway which
was a long pending demand of the people and restarted the bus service on
this route, a step which has been widely welcomed. Talks are going on to
open similar links from points in other states.

Discussions are also going on a gas pipeline from Iran to India via
Pakistan. Once this is completed, we will be able to address a major
constraint affecting our economy.

It is our sincere hope that we work with all our neighbours in South Asia to
effectively address the challenges of poverty, unemployment and disease.
If India and Pakistan are able to work together, than we will have many
opportunities for making our countries prosperous. I am confident that we
will be able to fulfill this vision.

We have had historic links and relations with Afghanistan. It is our desire to
see Afghanistan prosperous and strong. In a few days, I will be going to
Afghanistan. We will try to strengthen and support democracy and
economic growth in all possible ways.

Our largest neighbour is China with whom we have a centuries-old
relationship, a relationship from which both of us have learnt a lot and
imbibed a lot. We are today willing and ready to deepen our trade and
cultural relations with China for the benefit of the two nations. The
agreement arrived at between our two countries in April has paved the way
for a closer relationship.

I greet the people of Sri Lanka, Mauritius, Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan,
Maldives and Myanmar and assure them with utmost sincerity that India is
willing to work together with them for promoting development, prosperity
and peace in the region.

My visit to the United States has been a major step in promoting friendship
with that country. By deepening our economic and technological relations,
we will be accelerating our own growth. Simultaneously, our two
democracies can work together to strengthen democracy in the world.
Russia is an old friend who has helped us in difficult times. We will deepen
our friendly relations with Russia.

We also wish to deepen our relations with the countries to the East. The
recently concluded trade agreement with Singapore is a major step in
improving our economic engagement with the region. We will be entering
into many more such agreements in future.

At this point, I would like to emphasize that the contribution of Indians and
persons of Indian origin settled abroad in ensuing that our efforts are
successful is enormous. They have not only traveled to far off lands to
achieve their dreams of prosperity for themselves and their children, but
have also played a stellar role in changing the world's perception of India.
The world today sees India as a major knowledge power whose people are
skilled, competent, hard working and peace loving. Even within our own
country, our scientists, doctors, engineers and scholars have contributed
substantially in the achievements of our nation. We are proud of all of them.

To conclude, I would like to say that the biggest challenge in running a
Government is to ensure that development programmes are implemented
in an effective manner. We will ensure that our outlays of expenditure are
visible to citizens as outcomes of progress. The Central Government, State
Governments and Panchayats have to work together so that the
expectations of people are fulfilled. If we have to achieve results, there is a
need to change the manner in which governments function. There is no
space in our government or in our society for corruption and arbitrary
action. We are not prepared to tolerate this at any cost. Government
servants must work with a sense of public service and they should be held
accountable to the people. Governments will have to be made more
transparent and accountable. The recently passed Right to Information Act
is a landmark step in this direction.

India is on the road to progress. The whole world is watching us with
expectation. It is possible for us to eradicate poverty, ignorance and
disease within our lifetime. This has been made possible by the advances
in science and technology.

There comes a time in the history of a nation when it can be said that the
time has come to make history. We are today at the threshold of such an
era. The world wants us to do well and take our rightful place on the world
stage. There are no external constraints on our development. If there are
any hurdles, they are internal.

We must seize this moment and grab this opportunity. We need to have the
resolve to make our country prosperous. We must have the self confidence
to realise that we are second to none, that Indians are as good as the best.
Our political system and leadership must show sagacity, wisdom and
foresight so that we are able to make the best of this moment and make
India a truly great nation.

Let us come together, as one nation, strengthened by our plurality, to work
shoulder to shoulder and build a new India. An India where there are no
barriers between the government and the people. An India where each and
every Indian can stand proudly and proclaim that he is an Indian. Let us
work together to build such a nation.

Dear children, join me and say ""Jai Hind"", ""Jai Hind"", ""Jai Hind""."
2004,Manmohan Singh,INC,NA,"Following is the free rendering of the Prime Minister's address to the nation, in Hindi, from the ramparts of the Red Fort on the 58th Independence Day, today:,",PMO Archive,http://archivepmo.nic.in/drmanmohansingh/content_print.php?nodeid=6&nodetype=2,"My dear countrymen, brothers, sisters, and dear children - Greetings to all
of you on this day, the anniversary of our Independence.

This is a day we salute our Tiranga and feel pride and joy in watching it fly
high in the blue sky. This is a day we remember and honour the leaders of
our Freedom Movement for the struggle they waged under the inspiring
leadership of Mahatma Gandhiji and for the victory they won against
foreign rule. This is a day we thank our soldiers and security forces for their
bravery and commitment. We salute them for their dedication and discipline
- farmers, workers, teachers, professionals, scientists and our elected
representatives.

In every walk of life, each one of us contributes in our own way to the
building of our dear Bharat. What is that Bharat that we all wish to build?

A Bharat that is just and humane.

A Bharat that treats all its citizens as equals.

A Bharat that is prosperous.

A Bharat that lives in peace.

A Bharat in which every person is literate and healthy.

A Bharat in which everyone who seeks work is able to find it, and works for
a brighter future for all of us. My greetings to all of you.

As I stand here before you, I am reminded of the words of our first Prime
Minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, when he spoke to the Nation on the first
anniversary of our Independence in 1948. At that time I was a young
student, and looked upon the dawn of Independence as the opening up of
new vistas of opportunities to build an India of our dreams. Panditji had
then said, ""All of us talk of India and all of us demand many things from
India. What do we give her in return?"" Panditji asked, and he said, ""India
will ultimately give us what we give her of love and service and productive
and creative work. India will be what we are: our thoughts and actions will
shape her.""

Friends, I ask each one of you to remember these wise words of Panditji as
you go about doing your work, be it on farms, in factories, in schools, in
colleges, in government offices, in shops, in research laboratories. Our
Nation is what we are. It will become what we make of ourselves.

Brothers and sisters, it is one brick after another that helps make a building.
Millions of bricks go to make a great building. In the same manner, the
efforts of millions of people go into the formation of a nation. The process of
nation building is a great enterprise of adventure and creativity. It requires
all of us to work together, bonded by our love for our Motherland. This love
flows from our identity as Indians. Whatever be our religion, region,
language, caste or culture, we are all Indians and India is ours.

Our strength derives from our unity in diversity. The principles of
secularism, social justice and the equality of all before law are the defining
feature of our nation. Today is a day we re-dedicate ourselves to the
service of our Nation, and of each and every citizen, especially those less
fortunate than us.

This day comes for us in the middle of the monsoons. Each year when we
meet here and see the Tiranga being unfurled on the Red Fort, we also
look at the clouds above and wonder whether it would rain. This year too
we have looked at the skies with anxiety.

In Andhra Pradesh I went to understand the problems of farmers, suffering
from the impact of drought, and to hold the hands of the families that had
lost their breadwinner due to the unbearable burden of debt. For miles
together I could see no water. In Assam and Bihar I went to share the
concern of people whose lives have been dislocated by floods. For miles
without end I could see only water. Drought and floods are two fundamental
problems that continue to bring suffering to our rural population. We need
concerted action to deal with these perennial problems.

Our government has already taken some steps to deal with them. We
intend to take more steps in future. We need to insulate our people from
the impact of drought by creating local level water security. We have to
mobilize our people to come forward to take up the challenge of water
conservation and management. We are committed to increasing public
investment in irrigation and addressing the specific problems of each river
basin, in an environment and people friendly manner.

Water is a national resource, and we have to take an integrated view of our
country's water resources, our needs and our policies and water utilization
practices. We need to ensure the equitable use of scarce water resources.

The waters of our sacred rivers have for centuries nurtured our civilization.
They are the threads that run through the fabric of our nation. We cannot
allow these waters to divide us. I urge you and all our political leaders to
take a national and a holistic view of the challenge of managing our water
resources.

Dealing with the problem of water is an important commitment we have
made as part of our ""New Deal for Rural India"". We have also taken steps
to address the problem of availability and access to credit in rural areas.
The ""New Deal"" that rural India needs must encompass investment in
irrigation, credit delivery, health care, availability of electricity, primary
education, rural roads and the modernization of the infrastructure for
agriculture.

We must increasingly use modern science and technology to address the
needs of dry land farming, the diversification of our cropping pattern,
micro-irrigation and the quality of our livestock. Improving rural connectivity
and access to information can enrich the farm community. Here
Governmental initiative can be multiplied by the effort of private enterprise
and community action.

Friends, more than three decades ago, Smt. Indira Gandhiji had given the
call ""Garibi Hatao"". We have reduced the incidence of poverty to some
extent, but there is much more remaining to be done. While liberalizing and
modernizing our economy and enabling individual enterprise to blossom,
we must pay special attention to the elimination of poverty and the
empowerment of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, Other Backward
Castes and minorities. Our development strategies for tribal areas must be
adequately sensitive to their felt needs and aspirations.

The empowerment of women is an important priority and the education of
the girl child is vital to it. Our children are our future. In framing our policies
we must keep the interests of future generations in mind. The Government
will pursue social and economic policies that are conducive to the proper
growth and development of our children, investing in their education, health
and nutrition. A healthy child makes a healthy nation.

Employment generation has not kept pace with demand for jobs.
Government will address this deficiency in the growth process by
encouraging the growth of small and medium enterprises, agro industries
and sectors like tourism, where there is a high job potential. There is also
an urgent need to provide employment in rural areas especially in areas
suffering from prolonged drought. The ""Food For Work Programme"" will be
an important part of our strategy to deal with this challenge. New
investment in the infrastructure sector will also help generate new jobs.

Our approach has to be one of seeking faster growth while ensuring that
the benefits of growth are more evenly distributed. Our policies for higher
economic growth and modernization will be combined with an emphasis on
social justice, communal harmony, rural development, regional balance and
concern for the environment.

Dear Countrymen, from the National Common Minimum Programme, I
have identified seven priority sectors for focused attention. These are
agriculture, water, education, health care, employment, urban renewal and
infrastructure. These Seven Sectors (saat sutra) are the pillars of the
development bridge we must cross to ensure higher economic growth and
more equitable social and economic development.

The concerns of most of our citizens revolve around what we do for
agriculture, water, education, health and employment. We recognize that
for the development of the country what we are able to do in the key
infrastructure sectors like power, roads, railways, ports and airports is also
critical.

The plans and priorities of our government have been outlined in detail in
the National Common Minimum Programme, in my first address to the
nation and in the Finance Minister's recent Budget speech. Today, I have
no promises to make, but I have promises to keep.

The real challenge for me and for the Government at all levels is the
challenge of implementation of our stated policies and programmes.
Central, State and local bodies have to work together for Government to be
an effective instrument of development for the benefit of our people. There
are areas, in which the Government has to be actively engaged, like
education, health care, roads, railways, high technology and defence.

However, for Government to be able to deliver results, we must reform the
functioning of government. We have to make officials accountable - make
Government more transparent. We have to make public enterprises more
efficient. Citizens increasingly demand governments that are accountable
to them. They have a concern both for probity and efficiency in public
affairs.

Fellow Citizens, the question of ethics in public life has repeatedly agitated
our people and we have tried to find Constitutional, legislative and
administrative devices to deal with the challenge. The time has come for us
to consensually evolve a code of conduct for all political parties, a code of
ethics for all individuals in public life, and a code of best practices for the
Government at all levels. On this solemn occasion let us resolve to work
together to develop such a code of conduct in a consensual way so as to
uphold the values enshrined in our Constitution.

We must also look within our parties, and ourselves and ask ourselves
what is the root cause of the decline in values in public life? How do we
reform our public institutions, our political parties, and our government at
various levels? When we launched economic reforms over a decade ago,
we tried to liberate individual enterprise from the stranglehold of
bureaucracy. We will continue to widen the space available for private
enterprise and individual initiative.

But governments cannot be wished away, especially in a developing
country like ours where the government has an important role to play. The
challenge for economic reform today is to breathe new life into government
so that it can play a positive role where it must.

But what is government? Government comprises people's representatives
and civil servants. The reform of government is, therefore, a reform of the
way we, the elected representatives and officials, work in government. It is
you, fellow citizens, as members of the civil society, who must mobilize
your enormous resources in support of such reform. To make democratic
institutions more accountable we are committed to take several steps to
strengthen the lowest tier of panchayats and urban local bodies. We need
to build the capacity of decentralized bodies and their elected
representatives and this is best done through effective transfer of funds and
functions to them.

Today if we effectively utilize our decentralised system of governance
through panchayat raj, we can take concerted action for more effective
delivery of basic services such as primary education, public health and
health care, providing safe drinking water and sanitation.

When we talk of reforming government and of Panchayat Raj we are
reminded of Rajiv Gandhi who took pioneering initiatives in both these
areas. Also, nearly twenty years ago, Rajiv Gandhi first drew the nation's
attention to the newly emerging electronics and computer revolution then
underway. The enthusiastic manner in which the young people of our
country have participated in the information technology revolution, turning
India into an ""IT super power"", is a tribute to the farsightedness of Rajivji.

It is a matter of satisfaction today that IT is enabling us to improve the
standard of living of ordinary people even in remote areas. We will continue
to explore ways in which modern technology can improve the lives of
ordinary people. We will improve broadband access and enable the
required investment in IT infrastructure.

We live in an age where science and technology have become an
important determinant of power and wealth. For our country to attain its due
place in the 21st century, it is necessary to integrate science and
technology in to all our development processes. The promotion of scientific
temper must truly become a massive national movement.

We cannot make higher education a prisoner of either bureaucracy or
ideology. It must develop on the foundations of professional excellence and
intellectual integrity. The pursuit of excellence and concern for social equity
must inform all our educational processes. The revered Dr. Ambedkar
recognized very early the importance of education in the empowerment of
the under-privileged. ""We may forego material benefits"", observed Dr
Ambedkar, ""but we cannot forego our right and opportunities to reap the
benefit of the highest education to the fullest extent.""

Dear Countrymen, ours is a vast country in which many States are as big
as some countries of the world. For the benefits of development to reach all
corners of the country the Centre and States have to work in a spirit of
cooperative federalism. It is the responsibility of the central government to
help States to realize our common and shared objectives of development.
But, there is much that State and local governments can do to promote
growth, social justice and welfare. They must raise the required resources
to the extent feasible. Equally important, attention must also be paid to the
quality and effectiveness of Government.

I am concerned about the slow rate of growth of the backward regions, just
as I am concerned about the economic distress of the less privileged
sections of our society.

We will encourage new investment in less developed regions. We will help
in strengthening developmental institutions there. Special attention must
continue to be paid to governance and development in the North-Eastern
States and in Jammu and Kashmir. The pattern of development must be
such as to create new opportunities for job creation so that the youth of
these regions can look to the future with renewed hope and confidence.
These regions of our country can benefit by improving rail and road
connectivity and encouraging new investment.

Both the North-East and Jammu and Kashmir are the most beautiful
regions of our country. If we can work together to create an environment
conducive to development and tourism, these regions will prosper more.
Peace, social and political stability and communal harmony are essential
for economic development. People want such peace and stability so that
they can lead safe, secure and normal lives and go about their work, relax
and enjoy life.

We must fight all anti-national and anti-social forces that try to disrupt
normal life. Be they terrorists or communal and other such divisive forces.
Terrorism is a threat to our normal lives and we must all unite in fighting it.
Violence has never helped in the progress and prosperity of any society.
We will fight this menace to civilized existence with determination. There
should be no doubts on this score. However, we are willing to talk to any
group provided they abjure the path of violence.

Friends, today I want each of you to show the same degree of
self-confidence that our freedom fighters showed, when they led our
country to freedom, in your encounters with new markets and new
opportunities. We have been an open society. But, in being open to the
world, we have not lost our identity as a people. Again I remind you of what
Gandhiji taught us. That our nation must be like a house built on firm
foundations, whose windows are wide open to let the winds blow freely in
every direction.

""I want the winds from every corner to blow through my house"" Gandhiji
said, ""but I refuse to be swept off my feet by any of them"". That has been
our attitude to the world, culturally and economically, for centuries. We
must continue to adopt that attitude even as we seek to build a more self
reliant and modern economy.

It is such focused attention to development that will address the real
concerns of our people today. It is by strengthening our economy and
making our democracy more inclusive that we can walk tall in the comity of
nations. It is because of our commitment to democracy and development
that we also wish to live in peace in our neighbourhood and with the world
as a whole.

As a people we have always lived in peace with our neighbours in Asia and
the Indian Ocean region. For centuries we welcomed with open arms both
travellers and traders from different parts of the world. We ourselves set
sail in search of markets and to spread the philosophies of our wise men.
Even today we want to live in a neighbourhood of peace and prosperity.

I assure our armed forces and security forces our unstinted support to their
welfare and to the modernization of our defences. They have played an
admirable role in the defence of our unity and integrity. Not only have they
defended our frontiers but also at home they have readily helped whenever
their services have been sought in rescue and relief operations and in the
protection of the life and property of fellow Indians.

Even as we devote our attention to defence, we must pay heed to the
needs of development. All our neighbours are, like us, developing countries
whose priority will also have to be the improvement of the quality of life of
their citizens. We are not only bound together by our common borders but
also by our common destiny. The assurance of peace and prosperity in our
neighbourhood is an important priority for us. Our Government will give the
highest priority to building closer political, economic and cultural ties with all
our neighbours.

We have always been in favour of a purposive bilateral dialogue with
Pakistan to resolve all outstanding issues. It is our intention to carry forward
with firm resolve and sincerity the composite dialogue process with
Pakistan. The edifice of peace that we wish to build must stand on the twin
pillars of mutual trust and confidence. Of course, trends of cross-border
terrorism and violence make our task more difficult and complex.

As far as our relations with China are concerned, the positive trends which
commenced with Shri Rajiv Gandhi's visit to China in 1988, have provided
a sound basis for later trends in our bilateral ties. We are committed to
strengthening and expanding these relations. We shall carry forward the
process of discussion to resolve the boundary question with political vision
and a practical approach.

We value the friendship of all nations, big and small and we will seek closer
economic relations with all countries. As a democratic country of more than
a 100 crore people we are destined to play an important and positive role in
world affairs, in structuring a just international order.

As a people, Indians have contributed a great deal to the advancement of
knowledge. We value the positive role that the people of Indian origin have
played in other countries. People of Indian origin are our cultural
ambassadors wherever they live. We value their contribution to the
societies they now live in just as much as we value the contribution they
make to India, the land of their ancestors. Indians abroad are our ""Brain
Bank"". They have shown how enterprising we Indians can be if the
environment is conducive. If the required infrastructure is provided and
individual initiative is rewarded we can be as good as the best in the world.

At home, this is the challenge for our Government. To create the
environment in which merit is recognized, hard work and creativity are
rewarded.

My dear countrymen, brothers and sisters, there are many things we must
do in government to be able to meet your needs and fulfill your aspirations.
This is a responsibility we have taken upon ourselves and as your
representatives in government we are ultimately answerable to you. This is
the essence of a democracy and I have accepted this responsibility with all
humility.

The power of the people, however, is infinitely greater than the power of
governments. But, it is by combining the two that we can make our nation
truly great. However, as I have said already, there are limits to how much
the government can do. Part of the solution lies in each one of us, in our
families, in our communities. If we can all cooperate with one another and
work together as a community there is much we can do without looking for
intervention by the government. We have to revive the spirit of community
service and the spirit of nationalism, especially among our youth.

Our national movement is unique in world history because we secured our
freedom through non-violent means and by igniting hope in the minds of
ordinary people. Generations of young people have been inspired by the
Mahatma, a frail and soft-spoken man who shook the foundations of the
mighty British Empire.

I want our youth to understand Mahatma Gandhiji's message that each one
of us has the power to do good for our nation if we are only so determined.
Let us all work together to revive that spirit of idealism, self-sacrifice,
discipline and unity of purpose that characterized our freedom struggle. I
am confident that the people of this great nation have the will,
determination and the resources to meet this challenge. India's destiny
beckons us to pool all our wisdom, experience and knowledge to make this
future happen.

I am confident that this is possible and within our reach. Our government
will do all that lies within its power to convert this dream into a living reality
so that this ancient land of Bharat once again becomes a major
powerhouse of both knowledge and creativity. I commit our government to
the fulfillment of this sacred national task.

Dear Children, join me now and say: Jai Hind! Jai Hind! Jai Hind!"
2003,A.B. Vajpayee,BJP,NA,"Following is the English rendering of the Address to the Nation by the Prime Minister, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee from the ramparts of Red Fort on the occasion of Independence Day today:,",PMO Archive,http://archivepmo.nic.in/abv/content_print.php?nodeid=9239&nodetype=2,"Dear countrymen,

My hearty greetings to all of you on the sacred occasion of our
Independence Day.

Each year on this day, we gather at the Red Fort and unfurl our beloved
Tricolor. The Tricolor is a symbol of our freedom, of our self-respect, and of
sacrifices and martyrdom.

People belonging to the older generations would certainly remember the
time when young boys and girls would form themselves into small groups,
take the flag in their hands, and go around villages and city streets singing,
Vijayi Vishwa Tiranga Pyara, Jhanda Uncha Rahe Hamara. (May our
beloved and victorious Tricolor fly high in the world.)

Today we bow our heads in homage to the memory of all the leaders,
fighters, and martyrs of our Freedom Struggle.

My greetings to all the jawans of the three Armed Forces and to the
security personnel. We gratefully remember those brave soldiers who laid
down their lives while guarding our frontiers or in the battle against
terrorism.

This year the festival of freedom has arrived bringing the message of good
rains in most parts of the country. We hope that the areas, which have not
yet received adequate rainfall, would do so.

The last year went by in grappling with the crisis of drought. We assisted all
the drought-hit areas to the fullest extent, sent adequate foodgrains there,
and ensured that there was no hunger anywhere. We also took care of the
mute cattle.

Felicitations to our farmers, who with their hard work, have filled the
granaries in the country.

Felicitations to our industrious workers, skilled managers, and far-sighted
businessmen, whose successes have attracted the attention of the entire
world. Today, India’s economy has grown to be the fourth largest in the
world.

Greetings to all scientists, teachers, litterateurs, artistes, and to dear
children.

Felicitations to all the people of Indian origin living abroad. They have made
a remarkable contribution to raising India’s stature in the world. We are
proud of them.

Today, we offer our salutations to Mother India, whose children we all are.
Whatever be our religion, caste, region, or language, we all are one. This
unity is our strength.

We should cherish the diversity that underpins this unity. But we must,
under all circumstances and at any cost, keep our national unity and
integrity intact. This is the most important message of Independence Day.

Sisters and brothers, this is the sixth consecutive time that I have been
speaking to you from the ramparts of this historic Red Fort. This has been
possible only because of your affection and support.

The dream of India as a great nation, which we had seen during the
Freedom Struggle, continues to inspire us even today. To some extent, this
dream has been realized. Yet, a lot more remains to be accomplished.

Despite all the hardships, and braving all the challenges in these fifty-six
years, India is standing in the world with her head held high.
The nation’s security is supreme to us. India cannot be dependent on
others for her security. Therefore, the first act of my Government five years
ago was to make India, for her self-defence, a nuclear weapons state.

The world is changing. New challenges are emerging before us. We have
to make India stronger both economically and socially.

In the past five years, India’s prestige in the world has gone up, thanks to
our pro-active foreign policy. The international community’s way of looking
at us has undergone a big change. The world is now recognizing India:

As the world’s largest democracy;
As an emerging global economic power;
As the confluence of a modern nation and an ancient civilization;
As a powerful country, dedicated to the ideal of peace.
Sisters and brothers, it is our policy to establish friendly and cooperative
relations with all our neighbors. We believe in resolving all disputes
peacefully. Our frequent initiatives to normalize relations with Pakistan are
not a sign of our weakness; rather, they are an indication of our
commitment to peace.

In recent months, there has been some progress in normalizing relations
with Pakistan. Nevertheless, terrorist activities are still continuing. The test
of our neighbour’s sincerity lies in whether he is prepared to stop
cross-border terrorism totally.

We hope that Pakistan abjures its anti-India outlook. The people of both
countries wish to live in peace.

I have been telling our Pakistani friends that we have spent fifty years
fighting. How much more blood is yet to be spilt? The two of us need to
fight against poverty, against unemployment, and against backwardness.
We should increase trade and economic links between our two countries.
When we share a two thousand kilometer long border, it makes no sense
for us to trade via a third country.

Let people travel to and fro. Let more and more elected representatives
visit each other’s country. Let us expand bilateral cultural relations.

Let us open some new doors, new windows, and new light-holes in the
walls that divide us.

The love that the two-year-old girl Noor from Lahore received in India
carries a message, which our friends in Pakistan should understand.

On the occasion of Independence Day of both our countries, I invite
Pakistan to walk together with India on the road to peace. This road is
decidedly bumpy. There are even mines strewn along this path. Yet, once
we start walking, we will find the hurdles getting out of our way.

I had gone to Srinagar a few months back. I’m going there again at the end
of this month. The atmosphere there is changing.

Last year, from the ramparts of this very Red Fort, I had declared that
elections in the State would be held on time, and that they would be free
and fair. Not everybody believed in it then. But, we fulfilled our promise.

The free elections there have yet again demonstrated the fact that the
people of Kashmir have rebuffed terrorism from across the border.

The people of Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh have faith in democracy. They
want peace. They would like to see happiness return to their lives.

Those people who, while talking about Kashmir, advocate the right to
self-determination, wish to divide India on communal lines for the second
time. They will not be allowed to succeed in this.

This year, more than one lakh tourists went to Kashmir. There was a large
turnout of pilgrims going on the Amarnath yatra. Nearly six thousand
students from different parts of India are today studying in Kashmir. Next
week, we shall launch mobile telephone services in the State.

The knotty issues in Jammu and Kashmir can be unraveled only through
dialogue. We shall take forward the efforts that have been initiated in this
direction. People who have been uprooted have to be resettled in their
homes.

Dear Countrymen, the progress that India has made in recent years has
given me new hope and confidence.

An India, which was used to borrowing from abroad has started lending to
others.
An India that was perennially troubled by a paucity of foreign exchange,
has today accumulated nearly US $ 100 billion of foreign exchange
reserves.
The prices of essential commodities are under control. There is no
shortage of anything in the market.
Poverty is declining. It is our resolve to eradicate it faster.
There are no waiting lists now for telephone or gas connections. The
number of mobile phone users has gone up from 8 lakh to 1.5 crores. In the
coming year, 1.5 crore more mobile customers will be added.

We are all aware of the poor condition of our roads. Even fifty years after
Independence, there were nearly two lakh villages, which were
unconnected by proper roads. For the first time, the Centre has started the
Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana to connect them with good roads.

In the first five decades of Independence, only 550 kilometers of four-lane
highways were built. In other words, only 11 kilometers a year. Now, we will
build 24,000 kilometers of highways at the rate of 11 kilometers a day.

The Rs. 54,000-crore National Highways Development Project is
progressing rapidly. Three lakh people are working on it everyday. Next
year, this number will go up to six lakh per day.

Lakhs of young Indians have got attractive employment in the field of
computers. Sitting in our cities, they are providing services to hospitals,
factories, and offices in various countries. Software exports have zoomed
from Rs. 8,000 crore to nearly Rs. 50,000 crore.

Our country is now ready to fly high in the field of science. I am pleased to
announce that India will send her own spacecraft to the moon by 2008. It is
being named Chandrayaan I.

We have increased the amount of lending to agriculture and related
sectors. Interest rates have been reduced. We shall soon constitute a
National Kisan Commission to encourage new experiments in farming,
promote investments in agriculture, and study the various problems faced
by our farmers.

The Green Revolution and the White Revolution of previous decades have
imparted much strength to Indian agriculture. Now India needs a new
revolution: the Food Chain Revolution. Its aim is to achieve a doubling of
the average income of the Indian farmer by 2010. An important part of this
revolution is to reduce wastage of foodgrains, fruits and vegetables worth
thousands of crores each year.

Based on the success of Kisan Credit Cards, we have decided to provide
credit card facility to all eligible artisans, weavers, and fishermen. The rate
of interest on loans given to them will be reduced to 9 percent a year. A
contributory insurance scheme will also be started for their benefit.
Under the Antyodaya Anna Yojana, 1.5 crore poorest families in the
country are being given 35 kilos of foodgrains each month at the rate of Rs.
2 a kilo of wheat and Rs. 3 a kilo of rice. Never before were foodgrains
provided at such cheap prices. This is the largest food security program in
the world.

With the launch of the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, no child, especially the girl
child, will be deprived of primary education. To implement this program
effectively, 2.5 lakh new teachers will be appointed this year itself.

The Mid-Day Meal Scheme for children up to class five is going on in some
States. Now, we have decided to run it throughout the country. Later, this
will be extended to students up to class ten. This National Program will be
known as ~Akshaypatra~. I appeal to voluntary organizations, religious
establishments and women’s self-help groups to come forward to
implement this program in an effective way.

I know what people in under-developed States have to suffer due to the
lack of good hospital services there. Therefore, under the Pradhan Mantri
Swasthya Suraksha Yojana, six new hospitals with modern facilities, like
those available at AIIMS in Delhi, will be established in backward States in
the next three years.

Friends, for decades a debate was going on about a project to link our
rivers, as a way of freeing India from the curse of floods and droughts. Now
we have taken up this challenge. I am pleased to inform you that work on
two river-linking projects, with the cooperation of State Governments, will
be taken up before the end of this year. We will mobilize necessary
resources for these projects.

Never before had housing construction taken place at the kind of speed
witnessed in the past five years. Never before were housing loans available
at such low rates as now. Lakhs of people have got employment in the
housing sector.

India has limitless potential in tourism. Take the case of this historic Red
Fort itself. It has been taken up for comprehensive restoration for the very
first time in its 350 years. I can see that a beautiful garden is coming up in
the ground in front of me. It can be befittingly called the ~August 15 Park~.

I would like you too to emulate this example by undertaking such beautiful
projects for the conservation of heritage in your own village or town.

The over-riding objective of our policy of economic reforms is just this: We
want to create a dynamic economy that not only succeeds against global
competition, but is also caring and compassionate towards the poor and
the neglected.

We express our condolences for those who have become victims of
untimely death in recent mishaps and natural calamities.

Sisters and brothers, the hands of young Indians are today scripting India’s
bright future. An ancient nation with a history of several thousand years has
once again become a Young Nation and is all set to create a new history.

Today, in this nation of a 100 crore people, 60 crore are less than thirty
years old. This generation is better educated than any generation in the
past, and more ambitious than any generation in the past. It is a generation
that has made up its mind not to fall behind anyone in the world in this age
of competition.

Today, the doors of opportunity are opening up for our young people all
over the world. These opportunities will only increase in the coming years
and decades. Therefore, we should educate our youth in science,
technology and other new disciplines from now itself.
I appeal to all, that we listen to the heartbeats of this Young India; that we
understand the dreams of this Young India; that we encourage this Young
India in every way possible; and, that we give proper guidance to this
Young India.

Countrymen, today there is a paramount need that we maintain peace in
our society and strengthen the bonds of brotherhood. Development
requires peace, goodwill and mutual cooperation. Those who wish to divide
the society on the basis of religion, caste or community are doing harm to
the country.

India is a multi-religious nation. It is against both its nature and culture to
practice discrimination or to do injustice to anybody on the grounds of faith.
We should always care for the minorities and be attentive towards their
welfare.

Peace talks in the North-Eastern States are yielding positive results. The
hands that took up the gun now wish to participate in the development of
their region. The Government is ready to welcome them.

Friends, it is our responsibility, the responsibility of the Government as well
as of the society, that we provide equal opportunities to our brethren
belonging to the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Backward
Classes and make them partners in the system. To ensure that economic
and social justice fully reaches them is not only our Constitutional duty but
also our moral obligation.

We have removed the difficulties that had cropped up in the proper
implementation of the policy on reservations. Untouchability in our society
is on the decline. However, we have to completely remove this blot.

We have established a new ministry for the development of Adivasis. We
have also set up a separate Commission for them. For the first time in fifty
years, the list of Scheduled Tribes has been revised and over a hundred
new communities have been added to the list.

Friends, after the experience so far, I have come to the conclusion that
there is an imperative need for greater commitment and accountability in
our system of governance, which has the responsibility of implementing
policies and decisions. There is delay in government offices even for
getting the right work done. Delays breed corruption.

My Government is prepared to fight corruption at all levels. We have
decided to enact the Lok Pal Bill, which had been pending for several
decades. In spite of opposition from some people, I have personally
brought the Prime Minister within the ambit of its investigation, so that you
can even book your Prime Minister if he commits any wrong.

Stringent steps are being taken against economic offenders.

Sisters and brothers, the Government of the National Democratic Alliance
has completed five years. All the previous experiments in running coalition
Governments at the Centre had failed. We have succeeded.

Today there is a tremendous hunger for development among the people.
They want such a stable government which is determined to improve their
living conditions and also capable of doing so.

In our polity today, there is, on the one hand, a growing trend towards
wanting to work together, but, on the other hand, there is also a scenario of
disarray.

Our States have governments of different political parties. The Centre has
established cooperative relations with them. Political discrimination on
account of ideological differences is unacceptable to us.
The proposal to reserve 33% seats for women in Parliament and State
Legislatures, as a means of women’s empowerment, has now become a
national resolve. Today, there are over 10 lakh women members in our
panchayats and municipal bodies. I congratulate them for their good work.

However, it is regrettable that it has become difficult to pass the Bill for
Women’s Reservation in its original form because of a lack of consensus in
Parliament.

Now a new proposal has been brought forward that seeks to create 33%
double- member seats, in which one of them is reserved for women. This is
a practical suggestion. All the supporters of women’s reservation should
consider it with a positive outlook. If there is any other suggestion on which
a consensus is possible, the same should be implemented. There should
be no further delay in realizing this goal, for which our sisters have been
waiting for a long time.

Dear Countrymen, today the nation is at such a turning point from where it
can take a big leap forward. The yearning to achieve the lofty vision of
making India a Developed Nation by 2020 is gathering strength all over the
country.

In just one generation, India can be liberated from the curse of poverty,
unemployment and underdevelopment. This is not a daydream. It can be
turned into reality. Many countries in the world have demonstrated it.

Look behind a little. India has marched forward by overcoming many a
formidable crisis. Today, when the era of resurgence has arrived, why
should there be any doubt in anyone’s mind?

What is needed is only this:
That all of us move together.
That all of us move with discipline.
That we adopt a new work culture.
That we work with a long-term perspective.
When this ancient and great nation combines talent and hard work, and
strives its utmost in pursuit of a common vision, it will certainly succeed in
building a bright future for itself.

Nearly 40 years ago I had written a poem, from which I would like to
present a few lines to you.

Together, we have to march

Obstacles will come, let them.

Dark clouds of apocalypse will gather, let them.

Even if embers smolder under our feet,

Or flames rain over our heads,

Smilingly, we shall light the fire

With our own hands, and burn,

But together, we have to march.

In laughter or in grief, in hurricanes,

In immortal sacrifices beyond count,

In greens or in ruins,
In insults or in accolades,

In pain, too,

We have to thrive

Heads held high, hearts swelled with pride.

Together, we have to march.

Thank you.

Sisters, brothers and dear children, join me in saluting:

Jai Hind! Jai Hind! Jai Hind!"
2002,A.B. Vajpayee,BJP,NA,"Following is the English rendering of the Address to the Nation by the Prime Minister, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee from the ramparts of Red Fort on the occasion of Independence Day today:,",PMO Archive,http://archivepmo.nic.in/abv/content_print.php?nodeid=9040&nodetype=2,"Dear countrymen,

My hearty Independence Day greetings to all of you.

My felicitations,

To the brave soldiers of the three Armed Forces and to all our security
forces.

To our hard-working kisans and diligent workers.

I greet our scientists, teachers, and our sisters and mothers whose
awakening has unleashed India’s Woman Power.

And, dear children, you are the future of our Nation. Lots of love to you, and
my blessings.

Members of India’s Diaspora, living in distant lands of the world, my good
wishes to all of you. You may be far away from India, but you are always
close to our hearts.

I wish to congratulate all our sportspersons, who did India proud in the
recent Commonwealth Games. In particular, our women who have shown
that they are in no way behind men. I am confident that Indian
sportspersons will earn similar success in the Olympic Games.

Sisters and Brothers,

It is fifty-five years since we became independent. Today, we pay our
homage to all the martyrs of the Freedom Struggle. We bow our heads
before Mahatma Gandhi, Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, and all other great
leaders.
We salute our soldiers, jawans of paramilitary forces, and police personnel
who laid down their lives in combating terrorism.

Our tributes also to the martyrs who foiled the terrorist attack on our
Parliament on December 13.

Terrorism has become a festering wound. It is an enemy of humanity.

Our neighbour claims to oppose terrorism at the international level, but
adopts double standards in the context of our region. After facing defeat in
wars, it has resorted to cross-border terrorism for grabbing Kashmir.

We wish to state once again that Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of
India. It will remain so.

The world cannot accept that the cruel massacre of the Amarnath pilgrims,
or the carnage of innocent women and children at Kaluchak and Kasim
Nagar are a part of any ~Freedom Struggle~.

For us, Kashmir is not a piece of land; it is a test-case of Sarva Dharma
Samabhava, secularism. India has always stood the test of a secular
nation. Jammu and Kashmir is a living example of this. And this itself is
Kashmiriyat.

We shall defeat cross-border terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir. This is our
resolve.

We wish to have good neighborly relations with Pakistan. The Lahore
Journey and the Agra Summit are a testimony to this.

India wants all issues to be resolved peacefully and through negotiations.
We are prepared to take some more steps in this direction. However, for
this, it is necessary to create a conducive environment.
Infiltration into Jammu and Kashmir continues even today. Those who call
the forthcoming elections in the State farcical should not give us lectures on
democracy. Let them take a look at their own track record.

How can attempts to flagrantly provoke the people of Jammu and Kashmir
to boycott elections create an atmosphere for any meaningful talks. Instead
of resolving problems, this will only exacerbate them.

Sisters and Brothers,

I am deeply saddened when I compare South Asia with other parts of the
world. When Japan, which was devastated in the Second World War, today
stands as one of the front-ranking nations; when the whole of Europe has
united, forgetting all the old enmities; why can’t we resolve all our
contentious issues through talks?

We can. We will.

Why can’t we unite and fight against our real enemy, the poverty?

This is a challenge. No one is going to come from outside and meet it for
us.

***

The process of peace and democracy has now arrived at a decisive turn in
Jammu and Kashmir, which has been grappling with terrorism.

Elections are going to take place in the State. The dates have already been
announced.

I am confident that these elections will be fully free and fair. No one need
have any doubts on this score.

I appeal to the people of Jammu, Kashmir, and Ladakh, as also to their
representatives to participate actively and in large numbers in the elections
and thereby demolish the motivated propaganda being conducted from
across the border.

No one will be allowed to create disturbances in the elections in Jammu
and Kashmir. All the designs to create an atmosphere of fear will be
frustrated.

The people of Jammu and Kashmir want to live in peace. For many many
years they have seen and suffered violence and bloodshed. They want to
create a future for their children.

My brothers and sisters in Jammu and Kashmir, today is an opportunity
when we can together heal these wounds. Together, we can participate in
the creation of a happy Jammu and Kashmir.

I would like that no citizen of the State feels alone and helpless. The entire
Nation is with them.

I am confident that all the displaced people, including Kashmiri Pandits, will
be able to go back to their homes with respect, in the new situation that will
be created after the elections.

I wish to assure the people of Jammu and Kashmir that if any mistakes
have occurred, we shall make amends. For this, we shall talk to the elected
representatives and organizations. Discussions will also take place on the
demand for more powers to the State.

***
The desire for peace is growing in India’s North-Eastern States too. The
demand for faster economic development is intensifying.

People are realizing the fact that the gun can snatch away life, but it cannot
make people’s lives better.

Our efforts for permanent peace in Nagaland are progressing towards
success. We invite all those who have taken to the path of violence in other
North-Eastern States for peace talks.

Sisters and Brothers,

In addition to external difficulties, we also have had to grapple with nature.
A large part of the country is reeling under a severe drought. In some
places, floods have shown their wrath.

Standing crops are wilting, sown seeds have gone bad. Kisans are
concerned. We share their concern.

The Government has taken every possible step to deal effectively with the
drought. Our godowns are brimming with foodgrains. We will not let anyone
die of hunger.

Relief is being reached to the weaker sections of society by extending the
scope of the Antyodaya Anna Yojana. Under the Rs. 10,000-crore
Sampoorna Grameen Rozgar Yojana, drought relief programmes are being
speedily implemented. Five thousand crore rupees have been given to
States to undertake various ~Food-for-Work~ activities.

Prices of essential goods are under control.

But all these are temporary measures.
The Government is now preparing an effective, long-term strategy to
protect the country from the curse of drought and floods.

We will make concerted efforts to save every drop of water. We will have to
adopt watershed management, rainwater harvesting, and all such
techniques.

We will shortly unveil a new initiative, which will be called Pradhan Mantri
Grameen Jal Samvardhan Yojana.

We shall soon start three important programmes:

One lakh hand-pumps will be installed in water-scarce areas;

One lakh primary schools in rural areas will be provided with drinking water
facilities; and,

One lakh traditional sources of drinking water will be revived.

Dear Countrymen,

With your trust, affection, and support, I am in front of you for the fifth
consecutive year on the ramparts of Red Fort.

There is stability in the country today. People want the experiment of
coalition governance to succeed.

Democracy has become stronger. Its roots have reached every village and
town. After Independence, thirteen elections to the Lok Sabha have taken
place. Governments have been formed and changed, but always without
any bloodshed and violence.

My Government is committed to carrying out electoral reforms. It is our firm
resolve to keep criminal elements away from power.

Dear Countrymen,

Today, India stands proudly on the world stage: tall, self-reliant, and full of
self-confidence. Our prestige is on the rise internationally.

It is necessary that we do not overlook our achievements. Undoubtedly, our
progress in certain areas has been tardy. We have to honestly introspect
on this. For, we have the potential to achieve much more than what we
have achieved so far.

Sometimes, we tend to talk about our shortcomings much more than is
necessary. This gives rise to disappointment. The Nation’s energy
dissipates.

On the other hand, the feeling of national pride inspires us to work to
achieve more.

We are proud of our kisans. Until a few years ago, we had had to import
foodgrains from abroad. Last year, we exported foodgrains worth Rs. 6,400
crore.

We are proud of our scientists and engineers. They successfully launched
into space not only Indian satellites, but also satellites of other countries.

We are proud of our entrepreneurs in the computer industry. Could anyone
have even imagined that one day, India would earn Rs. 40,000 crore in
computer software exports? But it has happened.

Behind these achievements, is the talent, the hard work, and the
determination of us Indians. The credit for this goes especially to the youth
of our country. Come, let us congratulate our younger generation for this.
Sisters and Brothers,

We have a multi-party system. The race for power is natural in this system.
However, this race has to remain within the limits of the ~Nation First~
principle.

We will have to draw a Lakshman Rekha in our political conduct. This must
never be crossed for temporary gains.

Today, there is consensus among political parties on issues of national
security. Then, why can’t we create a similar consensus on certain pressing
issues of social and economic development?

We can create this consensus. We must create this consensus.

Take for example, the problems in the power sector. The scarcity of
electricity has assumed crisis proportions in many States.

I appeal to all political parties to arrive at a consensus on the minimum
agenda for power sector reforms.

However, it is not enough to change the mindset of political parties. It is
also necessary to bring about a change in the mindset of the people.

Just think of the extensive theft of power, and of the Rs. 25,000 crore that
is lost through it every year. How can this be tolerated?

Today, kisans want quality power; they are willing to pay more if the power
supply is uninterrupted. But there should be no interruptions and cuts and
no impediments in its transmission to the desired destinations.

Countrymen,
The economic reforms that have been implemented in the past few years
are in front of you. An economy of scarcity has been transformed into an
economy of surplus.

Today, there are no crowds in front of ration shops.

There are no lines for gas and telephone connections

The queues for kerosene have become shorter.

Prices of vegetables may have risen in rainy season, but we have strived to
keep onion prices in check!

Telecom and Internet services are available to more and more people.
Their rates too are continuously falling.

Our chief objective of economic reforms has been to remove poverty
speedily. We are moving rapidly in this direction. The living standards of the
common man are rising. Today, a fan, a TV, a refrigerator, or a scooter can
be seen even in poor localities.

My dream is to see that every family has its own house. In the past four
years, we have initiated the process of construction of nearly sixty lakh new
houses. Of these, 35 lakh houses are in rural areas and eighty percent are
for poor families.

I dream of an India in which both the Government and Society are
sensitive. Our policies and programmes have been formulated with this end
in mind.

Brothers and Sisters,
Faster development of the infrastructure in our country is the need of the
hour. We are fully determined to ensure that this happens.

A network of world-class highways is being laid across the country. The
National Highways Development Project is being implemented rapidly. Rs.
55,000 crore will be spent on it. This is the biggest and most ambitious road
project to be implemented in India after Sher Shah Suri’s Grand Trunk
Road.

Similarly, the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana, costing Rs. 60,000
crore, will link every village with an all-weather road in five years.

These two road projects are generating jobs for lakhs of people.

Dear Countrymen,

Our aim is to free India from the curse of poverty and unemployment. It is
to make India a Developed Nation by 2020.

When this country of one billion people works with a common resolve, then
no goal is impossible to achieve.

The Tenth Plan has set the target of eight percent yearly growth in GDP.

We are taking some important new measures for economic and social
development. These will be announced separately today.

Sisters and Brothers,

I appeal to you to display the same emotional unity on the issue of National
Development as you always do on the issue of National Security.

Come, let us make Development a powerful People’s Movement.
For this, it is necessary that everyone rises above casteism and
communalism. We will have to leave behind all those things that divide us.

The horrific explosion of communal violence in Gujarat was one unfortunate
example of this. There can be no place for such violence in a civilized
society.

We must maintain peace, communal amity, national unity and integrity
even in the most serious and provocative of circumstances.

It is the responsibility of the Government and Society alike to provide
security and equal opportunities for the minorities.

Countrymen,

Come, let us as a nation look ahead, look to the future.

Someone has rightly said:

~Beeti Tahi Bisar De, Aage Ki Sudh Le~

(Forget what happened in the past, look forward to the future.)

Rather than getting bogged down in the issues and disputes of the past, let
us create a new future for ourselves.

All our programmes will succeed and all our dreams for progress will come
true only when we strictly adhere to probity and morality in public life.

We will not compromise with corruption at any level. Those who are in high
offices should remember that people expect equally high conduct from
them.
While on the one hand, there is a need for those in politics and
administration to change their behaviour, equally, our citizens need to
change their attitude.

Do not talk only of your rights. Remember also your own duties and
responsibilities.

The mindset of depending on the Government for every work has to
change.

I call upon all citizens and voluntary organizations to come forward for
social work.

***

It is our collective responsibility to ensure that Dalits, oppressed, and
people belonging to backward classes enjoy social justice and equality. We
do not do them any favour by doing this.

My Government has extended the period of reservations for scheduled
castes and scheduled tribes in government service for another ten years.
Their opportunities for promotion in government service have also been
properly ensured.

These reservations are not a dole, rather they are an instrument for
bringing about social equality.

My dear countrymen,

This fifty-fifth anniversary of Independence conveys one more message to
us. And that message is that all of us strive to our utmost for the realization
of the dream of making India a Developed Nation.
May our goal be the limitless heights of the sky.

May our feet be on the ground.

May our minds be full of unyielding determination.

May our hands be clasped together.

May our resolve be to march together.

If we do this, our victory is certain.

Come, let all of us unitedly affirm this resolve with the victorious salutation
of Jai Hind.

Join me in saying thrice:

Jai Hind! Jai Hind!! Jai Hind!!!"
2001,A.B. Vajpayee,BJP,NA,"FOLLOWING IS THE ENGLISH RENDERING OF THE ADDRESS TO THE NATION IN HINDI BY THE PRIME MINISTER SHRI ATAL BIHARI VAJPAYEE ON THE OCCASION OF 54th ANNIVERSARY OF INDEPENDENCE DELIVERED HERE TODAY FROM THE RAMPARTS OF RED FORT: -,",PMO Archive,http://archivepmo.nic.in/abv/content_print.php?nodeid=9114&nodetype=2,"My dear countrymen,

You just now heard the melodious band of our Armed Forces. I convey my
greetings to all of you. We are celebrating the 54th anniversary of our
Independence. Today, we pay our respectful homage to the martyrs of the
Freedom Struggle. I would like to remember today all the great men and
women of our Freedom Movement, especially Mahatma Gandhi and Netaji
Subhas Chandra Bose. They inspire and illuminate our march in the new
century.

On this occasion, I send my greetings to all the people of Indian origin living
in different corners of the world.

This nation of 100 crore people, inheriting a five thousand year old
civilization, is today scripting an illustrious chapter in its history.

Dear friends,

Remember the many hardships that we had to go through three years ago
in the aftermath of the nuclear tests at Pokharan. Today, those difficulties
are receding.

We faced those hardships for the sake of our national security, and we did
so successfully. Today our relations with many important countries of the
world have grown stronger and deeper. We are engaged in a Strategic
Dialogue with them on a regular basis.

India’s prestige has gone up globally.

Sisters and brothers,

We have always been strong votaries of world peace. For thousands of
years, we have been chanting the mantra of peace. — Prithvih Shantih,
Antariksha Shantih, Vanaspatayah Shantih  — praying for peace on
earth, in outer space, and also peace for all the flora and fauna.

Naturally, we have always desired to have peaceful relations with all our
neighbours. The entire world knows that India has left no stone unturned to
improve her relations with Pakistan. These efforts have been continuing
right from the days of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru. Many Agreements and
Declarations were signed. But these have not helped to establish lasting
peace.

I, too, attempted to make a new beginning. I went to Lahore for peace.

Yet, despite having signed the Lahore Declaration, Pakistan committed an
armed aggression at Kargil. Our jawans, with their bravery and heroism,
threw them out of our territory. I pay my tribute to all those soldiers who laid
their lives in that conflict. I express my deep sympathies with their families
on this occasion.

Despite Kargil and cross-border terrorism, we invited Pakistan’s President
General Pervez Musharraf for talks.

I told my guest in Agra: ~We have been fighting for 50 years. For how
many years more, you intend to fight? This has helped neither Pakistan nor
India. Because of the hostile relations, both our countries are spending a lot
of their limited resources on wars and for preparing for wars, whereas we
ought to be spending these scarce resources on the development of our
two countries and to improve the lives of our peoples.~

I had also told him: ~If we have to fight, why don’t we wage a war against
poverty, against unemployment, against disease, and against
underdevelopment.~

We know that the people of Pakistan yearn for peace with India.
We have to promote cooperation in trade, economics, and in other areas
for mutual benefit. We have to encourage greater people-to-people
contacts.

Unfortunately, President Musharraf had no interest in improving our
relations in all possible areas. He came here with a single-point agenda —
to make India accept Pakistan’s terms on Kashmir.

I could not have accepted this condition.

He wanted us to forget the Shimla Agreement and the Lahore Declaration,
and begin a new journey from Agra.

I could not have accepted this too.

He kept on describing cross-border terrorism as ~jehad~ and ~freedom
struggle~.

There was simply no question of accepting this logic.

As we had expected, there has been a spurt in terrorist activities after the
Agra Summit. There have been massacres of innocent people in Amarnath,
Kishtwar, Doda, Jammu and yesterday near Ghaziabad.

What kind of jehad is this? What kind of freedom struggle is this? And, for
whom is this freedom struggle?

The activities of Pakistan-supported Jehadi organizations are napak
(unholy). They are against the tenets of Islam and humanism.

Let no one entertain any delusion that Pakistan can succeed in wresting
Kashmir, through jehad and terrorism, what it has failed to get through
wars.

As far as the dialogue with Pakistan is concerned, India shall continue to be
engaged in this process. Nevertheless, we shall not hesitate in the least to
crush Pakistan-sponsored terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir.

Today I wish to tell the people of Jammu, Kashmir, and Ladakh that we feel
your pain and agony. We have been making all efforts to remove it.

We shall intensify the efforts that we have been making to bring normalcy
to the State and to bring the fruits of development to its people. Panchayat
elections have been held in the State recently. The people of the Jammu
and Kashmir will elect a new Assembly, after some time. We shall ensure
free and fair elections to the State Assembly.

On this occasion, I recall the couplets of the great Shayar-e-Kashmir,
Mehjoor. Its gist I would recall here:-

‘The caste and land of you Kashmiris is the same. Do not unnecessarily let
anything create a distance between you. If Muslim is milk, Hindu is sugar.
Mix this milk with this sugar’.

This Sufi ideology is the convergence point of Kashmir with the spiritual
tradition of India. Kashmiriyat is a fine example of Sarva Dharma
Samabhava (secularism). It completely negates the Two-Nation theory. We
are indeed proud of this Kashmiriyat.

The situation in the North-Eastern States is a matter of special concern to
us. Violence complicates problems; it does not solve them. It has created
hurdles in the path of development of the North-East.

Today I would like to reassure my sisters and brothers in the North-East
that the comprehensive peace process, that we have begun in the region,
will bear desired results.

India is a vast nation. It is multi-lingual and multi-religious. It is full of myriad
diversities.

These diversities are not our weakness. Rather, they are our strength.
They showcase our cultural richness. In these diversities lie the powerful
threads of India’s unity.

Sisters and brothers,

India is one of the ten fastest growing economies in the world. In terms of
size, India is counted among the four largest economies of the world.

India has emerged as one of the front-ranking nations in the world in
information technology, missile technology, and in many other areas.

When I see young women and men, of the new generation handling high
responsibilities with aplomb, my faith in India’s future gets strengthened. It
is these people who are making India a better place than before. They are
the architects of India’s strong and glorious tomorrow.

Now we can truly take pride in being Indian. Indians can walk with their
heads held high in the world.

In spite of the population having more than tripled in the past five decades,
we have been able to reduce the percentage of people living below the
poverty line.

In the decade of the ‘90s, it has fallen from 36 percent to 26 percent.

I do not claim that we have been able to eradicate poverty as rapidly as we
should, or could, have.
But I am confident that abject poverty is on its way out in India.

In the last decade, literacy in India has taken a quantum jump. I am
confident that in the current decade, India will more or less become
completely literate.

It is true that India’s economy is currently going through a slowdown. But
this is a temporary phenomenon.

This is also a global phenomenon, and not limited to India alone.

But there is no need to get too worried on this score, because the
fundamental indicators of India's economy are quite strong.

Prices are stable. Inflation is under control. Foreign exchange reserves are
at a record high. And, our godowns are bursting with foodgrains.

Because of good monsoon, there are bright prospects of the coming crops
on the economic front. Yesterday’s heavy rainfall had cast doubts that the
morning today will be full of dark clouds and the earth will be soaked with
the rain showers. But, this did not happen. Clouds have dispersed and the
sun has come out. We can now forge ahead towards future. Good
monsoon has come with promising prospects on the economic front.

We have taken steps to increase investment in all the infrastructure areas,
in industries, and in agriculture. We shall soon take more steps in this
direction. These will help in bringing the economic slowdown to an end.

In the past few years, natural calamities seem to have resolved to test
India. Orissa was hit by a super-cyclone. In Gujarat there was a
devastating earthquake. Some parts of the country have faced severe
floods, and at some places there is drought. Now, the task of their
rehabilitation is taking place on a large scale with the cooperation of all. We
thank the foreign countries and are grateful to them for the speed with
which they came forward with help. This symbolises that entire humanity is
one and if any of its part is suffering, then the entire body feels the pain. All
therefore should rush to extend help unitedly. Nevertheless, together we
have encountered these crises with great fortitude and solidarity and
provided relief to the affected.

We are going to put in place a permanent and institutional structure to
effectively deal with such natural calamities.

My dear kisan brothers,

You are the country’s annadata.

With your hard work, you have not only made India self-sufficient in
foodgrains, but have produced a big surplus. Scarcity of foodgrains has
become a thing of the past now. Earlier, we used to import food. Now, we
are an exporter.

Today, the Government’s godowns have a stock of more than 60 million
tonnes of foodgrains. We are augmenting the storage capacity.

I am well aware of the many problems that our farmers are grappling with.
We have been constantly trying to mitigate them. It has been our
endeavour to ensure that the kisan gets fair and remunerative price for his
crops.

So far, more than one and a half crore farmers have been given Kisan
Credit Cards.

Some people have been expressing apprehensions that cheap farm
imports will flood Indian markets because of our commitments to the WTO.
These have been proved false.

We are quite capable, depending on our needs, to impose or hike import
duties and to check unfair imports. We have, in fact, done so in some
cases.

It is true that a new scenario of world trade is emerging. This has presented
many challenges to Indian agriculture and to the rest of our economy. We
can — and we shall — face these challenges through collective and
coordinated action.

I appeal to all our farmers, workers, managers, businessmen, scientists
and researchers to prepare our economy to face global competition more
vigorously. For this, our agriculture and industries have to constantly
improve their quality. They also have to significantly reduce their production
costs.

Friends,

This year marks the decade of India's New Economic Policy.

This policy has brought many gains to our economy. At the same time,
however, several new problems have also cropped up.

It is true that certain recent developments have highlighted some of the
weaknesses in our financial and capital markets. This has made people
feel rather worried.

We have taken several steps to remove these weaknesses, and we shall
take more steps in the future.

The functioning of the stock markets and financial institutions will be
reformed to protect the interests of small investors.
Profits earned by hook or by crook cannot be the sole criterion for judging
the success of a business. The success of liberalization requires the steady
development of a new corporate ethic.

Brothers and sisters,

Some cases of corruption and scandals have surfaced in recent times. We
cannot turn a blind eye to corruption, nor can we let corruption proliferate. A
corrupt man must receive punishment for his deeds.

I reassure you that corrupt elements will not be able to escape the long arm
of the law, irrespective of how high a chair they may occupy. Only
yesterday, a new Bill – Lok Pal Bill has been introduced in the Lok Sabha.
The Prime Minister has also been included in its ambit, if there are any
corruption charges against him. Our Government will not discriminate in
any way in this regard and will not hesitate, if need be, in putting to trial any
person, however big or powerful he may be. We have already taken strong
action in several cases.

At the same time, I wish to state that there is a need to refrain from giving
baseless allegations the color of a scandal. I know that most people in our
country believe in earning their livelihood by honest means.

Dear Countrymen,

This year marks a decade of New Economic Policy of India. There is no
doubt that economic liberalization has benefited India. At the same time,
this too is true that the fruits of liberalization have not adequately reached
the poor and people living in rural areas. Inequalities have increased.

Therefore, after serious introspection, my Government has decided to give
a new pro-poor, pro-village, and pro-employment orientation to our
economic policy.

We shall make necessary modifications in the policy to remove regional
imbalances and social inequalities.

We are determined to ensure that the new economic policy becomes a
promoter of social justice and that its benefits reach our brothers and
sisters belonging to Dalit, Adivasi, backward, and most backward sections
of our society.

We have unveiled several important schemes towards this end in the past
three years. In the same direction, we now propose to take some new
measures: -

The Central Government will launch an ambitious new scheme of Rs.
10,000 crore to provide additional and guaranteed employment in rural
areas. This centrally sponsored scheme will be called the Sampoorna
Grameen Rozgar Yojana.

Under this scheme, those who take employment from panchayats to build
durable rural assets will be paid wages in cash and in foodgrains. For this,
50 lakh tonnes of foodgrains worth Rs. 5,000 crore will be provided to State
Governments every year. All the existing employment schemes of the
Central Government will be merged into this mega-scheme. Nearly one
hundred crore mandays of employment are expected to be generated
through the Sampoorna Grameen Rozgar Yojana.

Our economy shows a strange paradox. Nearly all the savings of our
people are deposited in banks. The banks are unable to use these funds
fully for developmental projects.
On the other hand, the unorganized sector of the economy does not get
adequate bank credit. This sector constitutes two-thirds of our economy.
The loan repayment record of this sector is indeed better than that of big
industries. We are considering some institutional measures to make
resources available to the unorganized businesses and industries.

Neither faster development, nor people’s participation is possible without
decentralization. Which is why, two important amendments to the
Constitution were enacted nearly ten years ago to empower the Panchayati
Raj Institutions. However, we have so far not been able to devolve the
necessary powers to the Panchayati Raj Institutions to empower them
financially and administratively in an adequate manner.

The Government will soon initiate a national debate to achieve this
important objective, involving all the over thirty lakh elected representatives
in Panchayati Raj institutions. We would like the Panchayats to fix their own
priorities, prepare their own plans, and to implement them with the
participation of the villagers. Towards this end, we shall devise new ways to
enable Panchayati Raj institutions and non-governmental organizations
engaged in rural developmental activities to avail loans from banks and
other financial institutions for specific development projects.

All of us know that democracy and hunger cannot go together. We shall
therefore launch a National Nutrition Mission. Under this, subsidized
foodgrains will be made available to adolescent girls and expectant and
nursing mothers, belonging to below-poverty-line families. Cheaper
foodgrains could also be provided to such religious, social, and educational
organizations if they so require, that are engaged in mass-feeding
programmes for the poor.
Friends, India is urbanizing rapidly. As a result, there is a growing shortage
of affordable housing for the urban poor. The Government has, therefore,
decided to launch Ambedkar – Valmiki Malin Basti Awas Yojana, to benefit
especially those belonging to the scheduled castes, scheduled tribes,
backward classes, and other weaker sections. The Ministry of Urban
Development will give a yearly grant of Rs. 1,000 crore to this project.
HUDCO, which will implement this scheme, will make available another Rs.
2,000 crore as a loan amount.
There is a shortage of three lakh housing units for the families of the
jawans in our Armed Forces. At the present rate of housing construction, it
will take thirty years for this shortage to end. We have decided to build
these three lakh housing units in the next four years.

I had mentioned, in my Address to the Nation on Independence Day last
year, about the Pradhan Mantri Gramin Sadak Yojana. This is now being
implemented in almost all the States. So far, the Centre has made Rs.
5,000 crore available for this project. This project would need Rs. 60,000
crore for completion. It is our aim to provide all-weather road connectivity to
all villages and hamlets in the country, with a population of more than five
hundred, by the end of the Tenth Five Year Plan in 2007.

The National Highways Development Project of Rs. 55,000 crore is one of
the ambitious projects of independent India. We shall further intensify the
work on this project. I am confident that these two major road connectivity
programmes would create lakhs of new employment opportunities and also
give our economy a big boost.

Our objective is Freedom from Distance. We are, therefore, determined to
link all the villages of India not only with good roads, but also with good
telecom and Internet services. A lot of progress has taken place in this
regard in the past two years. We shall further accelerate this work.

Small and cottage industries are a big source of employment. The Khadi
and Village Industries Commission (KVIC) alone provides employment to
more than sixty lakh people under its various units. It has added six lakh
new employment opportunities during the past three years. We shall take
many new measures to strengthen the KVIC. We have also launched
effective steps to popularize khadi and village industry products in foreign
markets.
Tourism is a big source of employment generation and foreign exchange
earning. Indeed, it is the fastest growing industry in the world today.
To achieve this end, we shall unveil a progressive National Tourism Policy
before the end of this year.

Friends, our entire society, and especially poor people are fed up with the
long delays and other deficiencies in our judicial system. The Government
has set up over 1,700 Fast-Track Courts to reduce the mountain of long
pending cases.
We shall soon take necessary steps to repeal or amend all laws and rules,
which hurt the interests of the poor. We shall also review all those
procedures and practices, which unfortunately have tended to make the
poor targets of harassment by agencies of the Government

The Government is committed to the goal of ~Health For All~. After the
unprecedented success of the polio vaccination campaign, the Government
has decided to soon start similar mass campaigns against leprosy,
tuberculosis, malaria, HIV/AIDS, and other such diseases.
In recent years, there has been a great interest, both in India and abroad,
in Ayurveda and other Indian systems of medicine. We are considering
making available a low-cost kit containing certain traditional medicines and
herbal products, which have proved their efficacy over centuries in treating
many common ailments. I urge our kisans and pharmaceutical companies
to seize this new opportunity created by the growing worldwide attraction
for Ayurvedic products and Indian systems of medicine.

We are observing this year as Women’s Empowerment Year. Therefore,
we shall impart greater momentum to the implementation of all the
programmes aimed at the welfare of our mothers, sisters, and girls. I
especially wish to congratulate the Self Help Groups started by women,
which have begun a silent socio-economic revolution. There are many
success stories in India, and also in the South Asian region, where Self
Help Groups using micro-credit from banks have made a significant dent in
rural and urban poverty.
Therefore, the Government has decided to facilitate the setting up of at
least one self-help group in each of the 14 lakh habitations in the country,
by the end of 2004.

We have taken yet another major decision for women’s economic
empowerment. Over the next three years, all public-sector banks will lend
five percent of the net bank credit to women entrepreneurs. This will make
Rs. 17,000 crore of bank credit available for women-sponsored businesses.

While launching these new initiatives, we are acutely aware of one fact.
Usually, the Government prepares schemes and programmes but finds that
the system is inadequate to the task of implementing them in an effective
and time-bound manner.

The Government has, therefore, decided to observe the coming year as the
Year of Implementation.

Towards this end, we shall constitute a Rapid Action Force to monitor the
implementation of various poverty-alleviation and employment generation
programmes.

Children are the most precious wealth of our nation. Ten years ago,
representing India in the World Conference for Children, I had argued for
greater investments for all-round development of children. However, the
agencies of the Government alone cannot achieve this. I earnestly appeal
to all voluntary organizations, businesses, and common citizens to ensure
that we together enable every child in India to develop to their fullest
potential.

Next month, there is a special session of the United Nations General
Assembly on children. India will reiterate her commitment to children’s
welfare at this important forum.
Friends,

There is political stability in the country. There is a thriving democracy. In a
big country like ours, there are bound to be small and not-so-small
problems. Political opposition is natural in a democracy, but there should
be no opposition for the sake of opposition.

There is full freedom in our country for political parties, intellectuals, and
the media to express their views. This is, indeed, a matter of pride for us. It
is only such freedom that nurtures and strengthens the roots of democracy.

However, freedom comes with responsibility. Our democracy demands of
all of us that we discharge our responsibilities conscientiously, and that we
respect proper norms.

Brothers and sisters,

We are all citizens of an India that is on her way to attaining greatness. We
should have confidence in India’s future. We should have faith in ourselves.
We should have trust in our own hands and in our own brains. Trust is a
resource. It has been my endeavour and the endeavour of my Government
that we nurture mutual trust. Trust should not be broken. Nobody should
come in the way of building mutual trust.

It is only on the strength of mutual trust, cooperation, and coexistence that
we can create a future of hope for India.

Come, let us together resolve today to build a united, strong, prosperous
and a caring India.

Jai Hind!

Jai Hind!
Jai Hind!"
2000,A.B. Vajpayee,BJP,NA,"Following is the free rendering of the Prime Minister, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee's speech from ramparts of the Red Fort on the occasion of Independence Day, here today:,",PMO Archive,http://archivepmo.nic.in/abv/content_print.php?nodeid=9113&nodetype=2,"My heartiest congratulations to all of you on the anniversary of our
Independence. Wherever you may be, at the highest mountain peaks of the
Himalayas or on the shores of the Indian Ocean; on the desert sands of
Rajasthan or in the green jungles of the North East, may my greetings
reach all of you.

 Today is also the festival of Raksha Bandhan. The power of
friendship can transform even a simple hand-spun thread into an
unbreakable relationship. On this auspicious occasion, I extend my good
wishes to all of you, especially to all my sisters.

 This is the first Independence Day of the new century. While looking
back at the century just past, we must work hard to convert the challenges
of the new century into opportunities.

 We must make our Independence last forever. We must reiterate,
today, our resolve to defend our nation.

 Today is a day of sacred remembrance. It is a moment for
introspection. We offer our heartfelt gratitude to all the known and unknown
martyrs. The memory of their martyrdom will forever live on in our hearts.
Their sacrifices will always inspire us.

 Today, we especially remember Mahatma Gandhiji. He was not only
the foremost leader of our Freedom Struggle, but he was also among the
greatest personalities of the 20th century.

 On today’s auspicious day, we extend our greetings to the people of
all the countries in the world. We wish that the 21st century would bring the
message of peace, fraternity, cooperation, and steady progress for the
entire world.

 Today, we send our best wishes to millions of Non-Resident Indians
and Persons of Indian Origin living in other countries. Wherever they may
live, they are always emotionally attached to India. We wish all of them
success and prosperity.

 Today, I extend my felicitations to the people of the three new States
that have found their place on the map of India after the reorganisation of
Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, and Bihar. We are confident that the new
States of Chhattisgarh, Uttaranchal, and Jharkhand will soon earn their
rightful place in the Union of India.

 We have succeeded in our commitment of creating these three new
States. After the formation of these states, we have to work together for
their development so that they become shining examples of success.

 The new century is a Century of the Youth. India, too, which has lived
for thousands of years, has now become a young nation. Nearly seventy
percent of our population is less than the age of 35. These young men and
women are more ambitious, more aware, and more active than their
predecessors. They not only think big, but they also work hard to realise
their dreams.

 I have full faith in India’s youth. It is our responsibility to fully support
our young men and women in building a bright future for themselves and
their Motherland.

 Dear Countrymen, last year when I had addressed you from the
ramparts of this very Red Fort, our country was going through an
extraordinary situation. The Lok Sabha had been dissolved and fresh
elections announced. It was in these circumstances, that we had to face
the aggression in Kargil. And India emerged victorious in this war.

 One year later, democracy has become stronger in the country.
India’s international standing has risen. Our voice is being heard attentively
in the capitals of the world.

 India is on the move. An India full of self-confidence is marching
forward on the path to progress.

 It is an India that is as determined to win against all adversities as
were our brave jawans and airmen who drove back the enemy’s forces.

 Our hearts are filled with ever-lasting gratitude towards the brave
soldiers of the Kargil and all previous wars.

 Pakistan would be committing a terrible folly if it thinks that it can
secure anything through the undeclared war that it has been waging
against India. Kashmir has been an unbreakable part of India, and it will
remain so.

 Our neighbour must realise that the clock cannot be turned back. I
would advise the rulers and also the people of Pakistan to pay heed to the
following verse from the lyricist, Sahir Ludhianvi:

Gone is that time, gone is that age,

When ~Two Nations~ was the slogan;

Gone are those people,

Whose purpose was Partition!

One, now, are all Indians,

One, now, are all Indians,

Oh India. know this!
Oh World, know this!

Oh World, know this!

 The 21st century does not permit the redrawing of borders either in
the name of religion or on the strength of the sword. This is the age for
resolving differences, not for prolonging disputes.

 The people of Jammu, Kashmir, and Ladakh are tired of violence and
bloodshed. They are craving for peace. We need to apply the salve of
brotherhood on the wounded body of Jammu and Kashmir.

 That is why, I recently said that India is prepared to apply the balm for
Kashmir’s agony within the framework of Insaniyat (humanity).

 The world knows who has derailed the move to end hostilities and to
start the peace process. The world knows who has torpedoed these efforts.

 On the one hand, Pakistan says it is willing to participate in talks. On
the other hand, it continues to be deeply involved in violence, killings, and
cross-border terrorism. Activities of the terrorists and proposals for peace
talks cannot go together.

 India’s willingness and ability to deal firmly with violence, terrorism,
extremism, and separatism should not be underestimated.

 Dear Countrymen, we have to build a magnificent nation. There is no
other country in the world, which is so ancient, so big, so populous, and so
rich in diversities; that has preserved its democracy, its unity, and its
culture; and that is fast emerging as a modern and prosperous nation.

 We have achieved success, too, in this endeavor. Every section of
our society has contributed to this success.

 In the present times, India is called upon to pursue two major
imperatives. These are: Security and Development. They are
complementary to each other. Without security, there can be no
development; without development, our security is incomplete.

 Now we have to make determined efforts to meet the economic
challenges before the nation. We have to accelerate and broaden our
development process, so that no child of Mother India remains hungry,
homeless, unemployed, or is without access to medical care.

 We have to reduce regional and social disparities.

 We have to make our brethren belonging to Scheduled Castes,
Scheduled Tribes, Other Backward Classes, and minorities equal partners
in our developmental process.

 Therefore, let us together resolve to make this decade, the Decade of
Development.

 To realise this goal, we have decided to achieve the target of
doubling India’s per capita income in the next ten years.

 Dear Countrymen, to achieve this ambitious target, we have to
undertake many important reforms in our economy. At the same time, we
need to implement necessary reforms in our administration, our judiciary, in
education, and in other areas.

 Reforms are the need of the hour. For example, the world has
changed much in the last fifty years; and so has India. There have been
many far-reaching political and economic transformations throughout the
globe.
 To reform is to turn the inevitability of change in the direction of
progress.

 To reform is to improve the life of every citizen.

 Take for example, the reforms in the power sector that the Centre
and various State Governments are presently carrying out. These will
reduce the losses of our electricity boards, stop the theft of power, and
ensure adequate availability of power for increasing production and
employment.

 Similarly, the reforms that we are implementing in the telecom sector
will enable us to provide cheaper telephones, mobile phones, and Internet
services in all parts of the country.

 There is no scope for either apprehension or fear about our economic
reforms. I remember that some people had expressed similar fears even
during the Green Revolution. These fears later proved to be baseless.

 The perspective of our economic reforms is based on our own
concept. You know that almost all political parties have, at different times,
and in different ways at the Centre and in different States, been adopting
the economic reforms programme.

 I urge our farmers, workers, other producers, industrialists, and our
intelligentsia to contribute to building a consensus in favour of the
economic reforms.

 In this connection, I would like to express my special appreciation to
all the central trade unions. I met their leaders three days ago, and we had
a very constructive dialogue. They have withdrawn their proposed
nation-wide strike. The interests of our workers will be fully taken into
account in the economic reform process.

 This year, the Government is going to take many big and important
steps to accelerate our economic and social development and bring its
benefits to the largest number of people.

 I wish to congratulate our farmers for ensuring that we have not faced
a scarcity of foodgrains despite a rapidly rising population. Today, there is
no shortage of food; rather there is a shortage of facilities to store our food
stocks.

 We have formulated a National Agriculture Policy for the first time
since Independence. This Policy aims to increase agricultural production by
four percent every year. Concrete steps would be taken to check the
declining investments in the agricultural sector and to facilitate increase in
these investments.

 For the first time since Independence, the Central Government has
devised a well-conceived and time-bound programme for rural roads. This
hundred per cent Centrally sponsored scheme, which is called the ~Prime
Minister’s Rural Roads Scheme~, aims to connect, within the next three
years, every village that has a population of more than one thousand,
through good all-weather roads. In the next seven years, every village with
a population of more than five hundred will be similarly connected. For this
project, the Central Government is making a provision of Rs. 5,000 crore in
its first year. It will be launched on Gandhi Jayanti this year.

 The National Highway Development Project is an ambitious one. A
four-lane Golden Quadrilateral connecting Delhi, Mumbai, Calcutta, and
Chennai will be ready by 2003. The North-South and East-West corridors
will be ready by 2007.

 Khadi, village industries, and small-scale industries are the backbone
of India’s economy. We would like the benefits of economic reforms to
reach them too. There will be a national convention of small-scale and
cottage industries on the 30th of this month, where we shall announce
many important decisions.

 In a very short time, India has become a strong power in Information
Technology. In software exports alone, India is expected to have exports of
more than Rs.2,00,000 crore by 2008. Through this, lakhs of educated
persons are likely to get attractive employment opportunities, both in India
and abroad.

 To reach the benefits of Information Technology to the common
people, our Government has taken many important decisions in the last two
years, and will take many more in future.

 I want to see every school and every village to have access to
computers and the Internet in as less time as possible.

 We are committed to ensuring that every village and hamlet gets
access to clean drinking water in the next four years. This year, the
allocation for the scheme has been increased by Rs. 2,000 crore and its
implementation will be intensified.

 Before the end of this year, the Government will announce an
Integrated National Health Policy, the aim of which will be to quickly
achieve ~Health For All~. The policy will also ensure that every citizen is
provided with primary health care. Ayurveda, Yoga, Unani, Siddha, and
Homeopathy will be given their rightful place.

 Recently, the rapidly spreading disease of HIV/AIDS has become a
grave challenge to our nation. I appeal to all sections of society to fully
participate in building awareness about this epidemic. They should also
make necessary changes in their behaviour so that this disease can be
controlled.

 The most valuable investment that we can make in India’s future is to
ensure that every child gets education. We have decided that by 2010,
every Indian child will get education up to class eight. We have launched
Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (Education for All campaign) to achieve this goal.
Education until graduation has been made free for women. All poor families
should take advantage of this.

 Science and technology have become the main engine of economic
growth. We should ensure that every vehicle of economic development is
equipped with this engine. Towards this end, the Government is taking
concrete steps to remove the gap between academia and industry.

 Dear Countrymen, a bright future is knocking at India’s door. We can,
however, realise this future to the extent that we are able to further
strengthen our national unity, secularism, social goodwill, and our
democratic system.

 India is a land of diversities. We have, in ample measure,
geographical diversities; linguistic diversities; religious diversities; and
diversities in customs and traditions. Despite these diversities, or perhaps
because of them, India has always remained united.

 We are one in many, and many in one. The whole world is amazed at
how India has successfully sustained this magic not just today, but for
many millennia.

 This may be magic for the rest of the world; but for Indians, it is life
itself.

 Religious intolerance and hate have never been part of India’s liberal
culture. I appeal to the people of all faiths and castes not to create
imaginary enemies, and not to resort to the path of using the sword that
inflicts wounds on oneself.

 Recently, a few unfortunate incidents have spoiled communal peace
and goodwill, in some places. The Government will not tolerate the
activities of any organisation that spreads communal discord or incites
violence.

 As Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar said, our independence is incomplete
without social justice. In the new century, India needs more social justice.
However, that kind of social justice (Samajik Nyay) is needed which also
promotes social harmony (Samajik Samarasata).

 The policy of reservations is one of the important guarantors of social
justice for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and Other Backward
Classes. The problem of backlog in reservations was persisting for some
time. Recently, we amended the Constitution and solved this problem.

 Women are the backbone of our social system and culture. Our
dreams of India’s future can only be realised if our women are educated,
are made economically prosperous, are empowered politically, and are
enabled to play a bigger role in society.

 We have promised to provide reservations to women in the
Parliament and the State Legislatures. There is now a need to quickly bring
about a consensus to implement this revolutionary idea. I have had several
opportunities to meet many women who have become members and
chairpersons of panchayats and municipalities by winning from reserved
seats. They have, through their performance, proved that they are not
second to men, either in the democratic process or in administration.

 The North-Eastern States have a special place in the nation’s life and
in India’s development. The implementation of developmental projects and
programmes has been suffering from many hurdles. Now, a special cell has
been created in the Prime Minister’s Office to remove these hurdles and
speed up the developmental process. This cell will closely monitor the
developmental works in the region. There has been an improvement in the
situation, thanks to the cooperation of the people and State Governments
of this region.

 It is sad that the biggest impediment to faster development in the
North-East has been the extremist organisations that are fomenting
violence and trouble in the region. I appeal to the leaders and followers of
these organisations to give up this dangerous and futile path. The
Government is presently engaged in talks with some organisations in the
region so that peace and development can be restored in the North-East. I
am confident that these efforts will bear fruit.

 India is a Union of States. Our States have an important role to play
in ensuring that the fruits of development reach every Indian home. We are
committed to decentralisation of power. We have decided to give our
States more financial and administrative powers. We would like our
Panchayati Raj institutions to also benefit from decentralization of power,
so that their functioning becomes more efficient and effective. We have
taken concrete steps in this direction.

 In the last two-and-a-half years, we have made continuous efforts to
increase dialogue and coordination between the Centre and the State
Governments. All States have contributed to this process. This has
improved cooperation and concord between the Centre and the States.
Consequently, there has been an increasing convergence in our viewpoints
and goals. For this, I thank all the State Governments and their Chief
Ministers.

 We shall intensify our campaign against corruption in high places.
Our country cannot make expected progress in development without
probity in administration and in public life.

 One of the big failings in our national life has been that people expect
the Government to solve even those problems, which they could easily
resolve through their collective efforts. The Government, after all, has
limited resources. In addition, experience has shown us that, those
programmes which are implemented without people’s participation, rarely
yield the expected results.

 Let me illustrate. Be it population stabilisation or dealing with natural
calamities, conserving water and electricity, or keeping our public places
clean and beautiful, all these initiatives can succeed only when our citizens
participate enthusiastically and in an organised manner.

 Dear Countrymen, on the first Independence Day of the 21st century,
let us draw inspiration from all the good and glorious aspects of our past.
However, let us not become obsessed with the past.

 I have been emphasising repeatedly that India should turn its
attention to the challenges and opportunities of the future. We should not
be stuck in the contentious issues of the past.

 Come, let us look to the future. We have to create a prosperous,
self-reliant, and self-confident India. Indeed, we have already embarked
along this path. We will march further in this direction. We are being
counted among the ranks of successful nations.

 We must not stop. Rather, we must step up the speed of our journey.

 I call upon our farmers, workers, artisans, employees, youth, and,
indeed, all our citizens, to make their contribution to a happy and
prosperous India.
 I ask our entrepreneurs to hoist the flag of their capabilities and
prowess and demonstrate to the rest of the world that Indian industrialists
are second to none in any competition.

 I appeal to the Non-Resident Indians to contribute their fullest to this
momentous task.

 I exhort our scientists and engineers that they scale new heights of
knowledge and science to earn a bright name for themselves and their
country.

 I appeal to India’s sportspersons that they take our tricolor to
triumphant positions in the arena of international sports.

 The entire nation sends its best wishes to our sports contingent that
is taking part in next month’s Olympic Games at Sydney.

 Come, let all of us contribute our mite to the creation of a Parishrami
Bharat (industrious India), Parakrami Bharat (achieving India), and a Vijayi
Bharat (winning India).

 Our motto for all ages has been:

Let us walk together

Let us speak in one voice

Let our hearts beat together

 In other words, let us march forward united, all of us together, and
taking everybody together.

 Let us make the 21st Century, India’s Century.
 This is our resolve. This is our aspiration.

 Thank you.

 Jai Hind!"
1999,A.B. Vajpayee,BJP,NA,Printed from the website http://www.archivepmo.nic.in,PMO Archive,http://archivepmo.nic.in/abv/content_print.php?nodeid=9169&nodetype=2,"Sisters, Brothers and Dear Children,
Accept my greetings on the sacred occasion of Independence Day. This is
a day of hallowed remembrance for us. This is a day of dedication for us.

This year's Independence Day has special significance for all of us. The
present century is coming to an end. The world will have entered the next
century by the time of the next Independence Day.

As we stand at the sunset of the 20th century, and look back at the events
of the era that has passed, we see the end of colonialism from Indian soil to
be the most important development. Our great leaders, and many
generations of our countrymen, waged a powerful struggle for
independence. By doing so, they paved the way for the independence of
other countries, too.

We pay our homage to those self-sacrificing and devoted leaders and
patriots who struggled for freedom throughout their lives, and, when
necessary, even laid down their lives as aahuti (offering) in the great yagya
of freedom.

Come, all my countrymen, let us strive to become worthy heirs to those
great leaders. We dedicate today's sacred day to their memory.

In the same way, I offer my condolences to the valiant jawans, officers and
others belonging to the Army and the Air Force, who displayed magnificent
heroism and the spirit of sacrifice in recapturing that part of our Motherland
in Kargil from the enemy. All of us bow our heads in gratitude for those who
were martyred in the Kargil war.

Almost all our countrymen have seen on television glimpses of the
impossible summits, which our heroes overcame and pushed out the
enemy. To gain victory at such heights is not only to surmount the
sky-piercing peaks, it displays the full might of the nation. It is a symbol of
the bravery of our Armed Forces.

How can we forget such heroes?

How can we forget those wounded soldiers whose only wish was: how can
we get well and rejoin our battalion to repulse the enemy?

How can we forget the members of the families of those brave martyrs,
who, on receiving the body of their beloved, said, ~We do not have tears in
our eyes, we have pride in our heart~?

How can we forget the mother whose lament was that she had had only
one son, and therefore, could not send another to fight for our country?

I know that mere words of solace are not enough. We have to take
concrete measures for the families of the martyrs and wounded soldiers so
that they may live a life of comfort and dignity.

It has been said that we remember and honour soldiers during a war, and
in the immediate aftermath. But as the days pass, we forget them. And it is
a sad fact that many who sacrificed their life and limb in previous wars were
often forgotten. I give you my personal pledge that this will not happen
again.

The Red Fort and its world-renowned ramparts are not merely a
geographical spot. The very heartbeat of India's freedom struggle is linked
to this fort and its ramparts. In the First War of Independence of 1857, this
is where Bahadur Shah Zafar was held a prisoner.

Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose made this very fort the target of his
campaign in 1943 and, blowing the bugle of Independence, gave the
stirring call to his countrymen: ~Dilli Chalo, Chalo Lal Kile~
It is from this very fort that our first Prime Minister, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru
hoisted for the first time, the tricolour of Free India in 1947.

More than half a century has passed. Today, we stand at the threshold of a
new era.

Come, let us enter this new era united in step and united in resolve.

When I addressed you from this rampart last year, there was uncertainty
and cynicism in the atmosphere. I was being asked:

Will we be able to withstand economic sanctions?

To what extent will we be able to ward off the economic crisis, which had
struck the Tiger Economies of Southeast Asia?

Will the Government be allowed to carry on its work?

Today, speaking to a self-confident India, I declare:

Sanctions have lost their effect. They have become a thing of the past. We
have dealt with them in such a way that they hardly had any effect on our
economy.

We kept the South-east Asian economic crisis at bay;

Yes, the Government was brought down, but the country was not. It
continued to march ahead, fulfilling the mantra of Charaiveti, Charaiveti
(Move on, Move on). The Government continued to discharge its duty.

Most important, a war was imposed on us.

We have not just triumphed over difficulties, we have achieved much. In
spite of obstacles that were put in our way,

Our National Income has grown by 6 percent;

Having crossed 200 million tonnes, production of foodgrains is higher today
than ever before;

Food stocks are higher today than ever. For this our kisans deserve our
felicitations. Our agricultural scientists are also worthy of our praise.

Industrial production is reviving at an energetic pace;

The new initiatives which have been taken in infrastructure have infused a
new purposefulness right across the economy;

At over 30 billion dollars our foreign exchange reserves are higher than
ever before;

The Sensex in the stock market has risen to record levels. In spite of Kargil,
our companies have been able to increase their market value by over Rs.
200,000 crore.

The off-take of cement for building houses is 22 percent higher than it has
ever been; Facilities which were known only to the rich, to the few, and in
our cities alone - insurance for their output, credit cards - are now available
to, and are being taken advantage of by farmers and by others in our
far-flung villages.

And we are stronger than ever. Pokharan has given us enviable strength
and self-confidence AGNI-2 has been tested - in the face of pressure - and
will be integrated into our defence arsenal.

PSLV and INSAT 2- E have been launched. What a feat our scientists have
accomplished: sending not just one, but three satellites on a single rocket
far out into space, and placing each of them at the precise point in space,
which had been fixed. This has been a magnificent achievement.

Yes, one thing has certainly come down. It is the rate of inflation. At 1.3
percent, this is the lowest rate in seventeen years.

There has also been a sea change in the way the world sees us. Last year
we had taken a major step - Pokhran 2- which was essential for our
security, a step which had been contemplated for long but which could not
be taken because of the pressures which were put on successive
governments.

Some did not agree with our assessment. Some even sought to portray us
as an irresponsible nation. However today, within a year, in the councils of
the world, ~India~ is synonymous with ~responsibility~

The world has seen that we will protect our national interest at all costs:
whether it is in developing an atomic weapons capability, whether it is in
developing missile - capability, whether it is in driving adversaries out of our
land:

The world has seen that we will withstand all pressures that we will
withstand all pressures that are intended to keep us from taking the
measures that we consider necessary in our national interest;

Also the world has seen that whatever we do, will be for self-defence, never
for aggression.

But the world has also seen that we are capable of doing so with utmost
restraint, with utmost responsibility. These were the principles, which
guided us when Pakistan forced the Kargil war on us. Our response was
well thought out. It was so effective that it left the enemy stunned.
The world today has well realized that we would do whatever is required to
protect our country.

The world has also understood that we would act with utmost responsibility
and restraint even when so gravely provoked. This has raised the
reputation of India in the international community.

The Lahore bus journey was taken to improve our relations with Pakistan.
This made the world realize that we truly want peace and friendship. This
journey was not a showpiece. It was a serious and well-considered move,
which we made knowing fully well that there could be risks in it.

Our honesty made an impact on the international community. Later, when
the bus to Lahore was taken to Kargil, it did not take much time for the
world to realise that Pakistan not only violated the Shimla Agreement and
the Lahore Declaration, but it also crossed the borders of trust and
goodwill.

That is what turned the world's opinion. Pakistan stood completely isolated
on the world stage. India received widespread support in the world for the
first time.

I do hope that the people of Pakistan too will reflect on these events. We
reached out to you with a message of friendship. What did we gain in
return? Hundreds lost their lives. Relation severe spoilt. The resources
which ought to have been used for economic and social development were
instead spent on war.

We need peace in order to raise the standard of living of the people in both
countries. For peace, we need trust. Has trust increased on account of all
that happened in Kargil. Does the path of armed intrusion lead to
friendship?
Terrorists are being trained in Pakistan. Camps are being run for them.
Hordes of terrorists are being sent into India. They are killing innocent
people. They are targeting women and children. How can meaningful
dialogue take place in this atmosphere?

Pakistan must realize that no problem can be resolved if it continues to
promote terrorist activities. We shall not let the evil designs of terrorists
succeed. Today, Punjab is free of terrorism. The people of Jammu and
Kashmir are fed up with terrorism. Even Assam and the North-East are
affected.

All of us want peace. People are worried about the future of their children.

Terrorism is a curse on the world. When it is combined with religious
extremism, it becomes a graver danger to humanity. All of you are familiar
with the saying ~Karela Aur Neem Chadha~ (The bitterness of Karela is
further worsened by adding to it the bitterness of Neem.)

In our case, over thirty five thousand of our people have been killed by
terrorists. Terrorism has become a big problem in many other parts of the
world, too. It is obstructing the path of peace and development. Today,
there is a need to mobilise world opinion against terrorism.

Today, on the occasion of Independence Day, India stands with full
self-confidence. Our gaze is turned to the future. Our standing in the world
has risen. Now, the people are not attracted by the controversies and
narrow disputes of yesterday.

Throughout the war in Kargil, I was specially satisfied by two features.

There was no communal tension anywhere in the country. Goodwill and
brotherhood prevailed everywhere, including in Jammu & Kashmir. This
must have despaired those who thought that riots would break out in India
as soon as the spark of war is lit. Those who hatched the conspiracy of
strife, must have been truly disillusioned. The people of all sections of
society worked for India's success in the war. A powerful wave of patriotism
traveled everywhere.

When I went to Kargil and met our jawans, I saw our entire country there:
soldiers from Nagaland, from Assam, from Tamil Nadu, from almost every
state were fighting for the country. There was not the slightest distance
between them on account of caste or religion or region.

This is the real India. We must make, their oneness our own. We have to
live for this India. We have to work for this India. And, if necessary, we
have to lay down our lives for this India, as our brave jawans did.

Kargil has once again shown that whenever our patriotism is aroused, all of
us stand as one with full confidence and determination, as a fist clenched in
conviction. We face our challenges unitedly. Our adversaries should
beware of this.

At the same time, there is an equally important lesson for us. Now that the
crisis has been beaten back, do not unclench this fist of unity.

The battle is not over. New challenges are knocking at our doors. The
patriotism that coursed through the veins of Indians should be made a
permanent feature of our lives.

All of us remember the talisman Gandhiji gave us: when in doubt about
what to do, he taught us, think of the least, of the most helpless man you
have seen, ask yourself, ~Will this step be in his interest?~ he said, and
you will see all your doubts melt away.

Kargil gives us a second talisman: As we contemplate a step, let us ask
ourselves: ~Is it worthy of the soldier who gave his life on those mountains?
Does the impulse which lies behind it measure up to the spirit which filled
that soldier as he fought to protect our Motherland?~

The challenges that confront us cannot be overcome only by the men on
the frontiers doing their duty. There is a need for an organized and
disciplined nation to stand behind them. We must defend our country and
develop our society by keeping national interests utmost in our minds. If our
economy is not strong, and if we are not self-reliant in important matters of
national security, then we cannot successfully face external challenges.

All of us, wherever we may be, whatever work we may be doing, we should
discharge our responsibilities well. We must never allow any limb of our
nation or society to become weak.

It is clear from the effective way in which we have overcome our challenges
and dealt with our difficulties, that we can do anything if we resolve to do it.
What is needed is to take a pledge: that whatever we can do, we will now
do.

I have a vision of India: an India free of hunger and fear, an India free of
illiteracy and want.

I dream of an India that is prosperous, strong and caring. An India, that
regains a place of honour in the comity of great nations.

Come, let us build an India in which we have balanced development that
benefits all regions and all sections of society. I note with regret that
several regions in the country - including the North-Eastern States - have
been the victims of unbalanced progress. The nation has an especially
pressing obligation to bring the people of the North-East into the
developmental mainstream.
Come, let us build an India in which Dalits, Adivasis, and Backward
Classes are not only freed from economic deprivation, but also enjoy the
fruits of social justice. The path that will take us to this ideal is the path of
samata, mamata, and samajik samarasta.

Come, let us build an India in which our nari shakti - our women - are able
to realize its full potential - from shaping the future of their families to
shaping the future of the nation. It is our collective responsibility to
empower them economically, socially, educationally and also politically. In
this regard, I would like to see early passage of the legislation to reserve
seats for women in Parliament and State Assemblies. We have already
seen how women have given an excellent account of themselves wherever
they have got an opportunity to serve in panchayats and other local bodies.

Come, let us build an India in which the minorities fully enjoy the fruits of
national development, while having full opportunities to contribute to it. Our
country belongs to all. And all are entitled to equal and fair treatment in the
eyes of the law and the Government. India, which is home to the great
secular principle of Sarva Panth Samabhav, fully guarantees the religious
freedom of all communities. It is a matter of immense pride for India that all
the religions of the world have a harmonious co-existence here. Unity in
Diversity is our priceless heritage.

It is also a matter of much satisfaction that the past year has seen a record
low in communal violence.

India is the largest democracy in the world. The tradition of democracy in
our country is very old. When this Century opened, democracy was the
preserve of just a handful of countries, and even in them it was limited to
small sections of the people. Today there are just a handful who are still out
of the pale of democracy. There is scarcely a country whose people do not
aspire to it.
Come, let us strengthen Indian democracy. Let us make it an ideal for other
countries of the world. Let us transform our political democracy into
economic and social democracy.

Come, let us make India a nation of high achievers - in every sphere. In
business and economy, in education, in science and technology, in arts
and culture, and also in sports. Let us make India synonymous with
~achievement~, achievement of the kind that can be benchmarked
globally. All of us are heartened by what our young men and women have
achieved in recent times. The success stories of young Indians working
abroad are making headlines almost every day. If young Indians can script
such shining successes abroad, why shouldn't we create conditions for
them to do so right here?

Come let us together build a Parishrami Bharat, a Parakrami Bharat, a
Vijayi Bharat.

To realise this vision, let us step out of the swamp of negativity.

Let us not be obsessed with the past. Face the future.

March with confidence towards the goal.

Turn from problems - to solutions.

Today, when the 20th century is coming to an end, and the 21st century is
knocking at our doorsteps, let us draw inspiration from our glorious past
and resolve to build an even more glorious future.

Come, let us make good use of the natural and human resources of our
Motherland, Bharat and make the 21st century, India's century.

We are inheritors of an ageless culture and a proud civilisation. Greatness
is our past - and also our future.

Come, let all of us together raise our voice in saying:

Jai Hind,

Jai Hind,

Jai Hind."
1998,A.B. Vajpayee,BJP,"Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan, Jai Vigyan: Harbinger of Progress",Printed from the website http://www.archivepmo.nic.in,PMO Archive,http://archivepmo.nic.in/abv/content_print.php?nodeid=9238&nodetype=2,"My dear Sisters, Brothers and Children,

I greet all of you on the occasion of the 51st Anniversary of our country’s
Independence. Half a century has passed still it appears as if it happened
yesterday. Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru had unfurled our beloved tricolour in
the blue sky from this very spot for the first time. Since then it has been a
tradition to unfurl the National flag from the historic Red Fort. I had never
imagined that I shall have this good fortune one day. It is a symbol of
strength and potential of the Indian democracy that the son of a school
teacher hailing from the dusty and smoky environs of a village has the
privilege of unfurling the national tricolour from the ramparts of Red Fort on
this auspicious Independence Day.

We all know that independence did not come to us easily. On the hand,
while tens of thousands of our countrymen and women suffered in jails
during the non-violent freedom struggle under the leadership of Mahatma
Gandhi, on the other hand, thousands of revolutionaries sacrificed their
lives on the gallows. We owe our independence to these known and
unknown martyrs and freedom fighter. Let all of us together pay homage to
them and take a pledge that we shall defend our freedom, even if we have
to sacrifice everything for this.

Our country has been subjected to foreign aggression. In this short period
of 50 years, we had to face four aggressions. But we have safeguarded our
independence and integrity. The highest credit for this undoubtedly goes to
our soldiers. Away from their homes and dear ones, braving dangers all the
time, they guard our frontiers day and night. This is why we are always
reassured about our security. Be it the snowy expanse of Siachen with
minus 32 degree Celsius temperature or the thick forests of the North-East,
the deserts of Kutch or Jaisalmer or the deep waters of the Indian Ocean,
our troops are vigilant everywhere. On our behalf I greet all these troops of
the Army, the Air Force and the Navy and other security personnel. While
congratulating them we must say ~O! Brave Soldiers, we are proud of
you!~

The Forces need our support. Our farmers and labour force have
strengthened the second line of defence in the farms, the barns and the
factories. We can never forget this. Lal Bahadur Shastri had said: Jai
Jawan, Jai Kisan. One is incomplete without the other, unfulfilled without
the other. I have added a new aspect to this: Jai Vigyan!

Pokhran Test

We can neither develop nor defend the country in the 21st century with the
resources of the past century. We have to modernise our forces to enable
them to face danger and safeguard our independence and integrity. With
only this aim, we conducted the nuclear tests on the 11th and 13th of May
this year. The tests of Pokhran were not the efforts of just one night. They
were the results of years of hard work on the part of our scientists,
engineers, technicians and the defence forces. I have only tried to further
the work the foundation of which was credit by Smt. Indira Gandhi. I was
only a means. The credit for this great achievement goes to our talented
scientists and the hard work of our defence forces. I wish to heartily
congratulate all of them on this auspicious occasion of this Independence
Day.

I am even grateful to all of you for extending your full support in this trying
hour. With a few exceptions every Indian, wherever he may be living, has
welcomed this step. Holding our head high that day we proudly proclaimed
“we are Indians”. For that day in Pokhran, the might of the Nation
manifested itself along with nuclear energy.

I wish to make it clear right now that India has always been an ardent
advocate of peace and will always remain so. We know and want to see
weapons for self-defence only. We would never use atomic weapons for
attacking anyone. Hence, we have put a self-moratorium on any new
nuclear tests. We ourselves proclaimed to the world that we shall never be
the first user of atomic weapons. We are doing it neither under pressure
nor fear of any one. We are doing it voluntarily because of our firm belief in
world peace and disarmament. Our dream is to see the world free from
nuclear weapons and we want to see this dream come true. Initially, some
countries did not appreciate our national security policy needs and doubted
our intention. Some of them imposed economic sanctions against us. But
now the situation is changing. The world is gradually appreciating the
Indian viewpoint. We have been able to make them understand our
position. As a result, some of the sanctions have begun to ease. We
welcome this changing global attitude.

However, we also want to make one point clear. India is a great country
and its people are powerful. The brave people of our country are always
ready to face any danger to defend their honour. Our history bears
testimony to this. No force on earth can deflect us from our chosen path. I
am saying this not out of arrogance but with humility and self-confidence.
We are willing to make any sacrifice to uphold the unity, integrity and
sovereignty of our country. We wish to improve relations with our
neighbours. We know that the easiest way to win a war is not to let it
happen. We are ready to hold talks with Pakistan on any subject, at any
level and at anytime.

You all know that I have taken the initiative during the SAARC Conference
in Colombo. I am somewhat unhappy that we did not get the desired
response. Still I have not given up. I will make another effort at reviving the
dialogue during the Conference of the Non-Aligned countries in South
Africa at the end of this month.

I believe that all problems of the world can be solved through talks.
Therefore whether it is Pakistan or China, we will endeavour to solve our
mutual problems through friendly talks. In the last few days terrorise
activities have increased in Jammu and Kashmir. The massacre in
Himachal Pradesh appears to be part of a bigger conspiracy. Such terrorist
activities everyday, from across the border, are like a proxy war.
Government has taken these incidents very seriously. We are facing them
with all our might and we will not rest content until we have defeated these.

Time for Retrospection

Whether in personal or national life, the 51st anniversary is always a
golden opportunity to assess the past fifty years. It is also the time for
retrospection and preparation for a leap into the 21st century. While making
an assessment we most often commit mistakes, tend to undertake our
achievements and magnify our shortcomings which result in gloom.

Sometimes, I see a growing tendency of pessimism in the country. There
may have been aberrations here and there but things have not gone that
bad so as to defy solutions. Our scriptures say that only fools indulge in
self-praise. But unnecessary self-condemnation is also like suicide. I want
that a realistic assessment of the last fifty years should be undertaken.

National Integration and Secularism

When we attained Independence, some Western experts had forecast that
we were unfit for being a democracy and did not deserve freedom. They
said we would soon disintegrate. But, today, we can say with pride that we
have not only safeguarded our integrity and independence but have also
shown to the world how the biggest democracy can be governed. Almost all
the countries which gained freedom along with us have kept the democratic
tradition alive. This is our 12th Lok Sabha and I am the 11th Prime Minister
of India. We have seen over the years transformations taking place from
the tiniest village Panchayat to the Parliament. You all deserve credit for
this. Your political maturity in all these elections have baffled political
pundits. I congratulate you for this. Our democracy is safe as long as you
remain vigilant.
On the occasion of the golden jubilee celebrations of our Independence,
the Nation has to address itself to the important fact that Independence,
national integration, democracy and secularism are complementary to each
other.

We have to remain independent under all circumstances. An essential
condition for this is national unity. Democracy is necessary for national
unity. Secularism and democracy are inseparable parts of national unity. I
and my Government are committed to all these four elements.

We oppose communalism in any form. We will ensure full security of the
minorities and guarantee their participation in development. We should
never forget that we are the citizens of one country. The boundaries of this
country extend from Ladakh to Nicobar, from Garo Hills to Gilgit. Ours is a
country whose civilisation and culture is more than five thousand years old.
Such a big country replete with varieties of language, faith, living and food
habits has resolved to achieve social and economic justice within the
framework of democracy. Simultaneously, we cannot forget that we have to
strive to rid this democracy of aberrations. Our legislators behave in such a
way in legislatures that even a schoolteacher would not tolerate system of
Governance through free debate. The opposition has the right to criticise
and Government has the right to implement. The opposition and the
Government are complementary to each other and adversaries.

Fearless and impartial voting has to be further strengthened. The electoral
system has to be reformed to free it from casteism, violence, money power
and other ills so that in the next century our system of governance is further
refined.

Title of “Food Providers”

Once upon a time, this country was a land of prosperity. The situation
deteriorated and we began to be counted among the poor nations of the
world. In the past few years our farmers and agricultural workers have
worked very hard to make the country self-sufficient in foodgrain
production. An army with an empty stomach cannot fight and a hungry
nation cannot have a restful sleep. Our farmers have made the country
self-sufficient to justify their being called “Food Providers”. I can only pray
to God that He shower happiness on the “Food Providers”.

There is a shadow of sorrow in this happiness. Today the condition of our
“Food Providers” has become difficult. I feel very pained that this year in
some states some farmers have had to commit suicide because they could
not bear the burden of their debts. I offer my condolences to the bereaved
families. As a tribute to these farmers I have taken a decision. The Crop
Insurance scheme will be broadened, new crops will be brought within its
purview and its geographical reach will be creased.

A high-powered Commission will be formed to look into the real financial
condition of farmers and to improve their economic condition. I want to
assure our farmer brothers who are the backbones of the Nation that they
will never suffer under this Government.

Easy to Say, Hard to Achieve

In Orissa, hunger still stalks the people in places like Balangir, Kalahandi
and Koraput. It is unimaginable that even 50 years after independence
some people are still stalked by hunger. I have told the Planning
Commission that the outlay on the Employment Assurance Scheme in
these areas should be doubled. My efforts will be to ensure that no one
dies of hunger. The country has made commendable progress in business,
industry and services. Some of our industries are making their mark on the
international scene. I congratulate all the workers, employees, managers,
industrialists and businessmen for this achievement.
But we know that this achievement is only a stepping stone. It is not the
attainment of the final goal which is to see the rise of India as an economic
superpower. I know that saying this is much easier than doing it. For this,
We will need to follow the path of hard work, establish high standards and
depend on self-reliance. We will have to produce goods of international
standard, which can compete in the global markets. Economic reforms will
have to be speeded up. But we will not allow others to take undue
advantage of our liberalisation. We will implement infrastructure projects
with speed.

“Swadeshi” does not mean an inward looking policy. The word has become
a global village. Each one is dependent on the other. In this open market
system we can use our inner strength to stand up to global competition and
I have faith that we will.

This 51st Independence Day is being celebrated not only in India but also
round the world. Every person of Indian origin in every country is
celebrating this sacred occasion with joy and enthusiasm. I give my good
wishes to every person of Indian origin round the globe on this occasion. In
some countries our brothers and sisters are watching it live on television.

Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) have brought strength to the economies of
the nations where they have settled. Now they have an opportunity to
strengthen India’s economy. We have floated the Resurgent India Bond
(RIB). Non-Resident Indians around the world are taking benefit of this
opportunity. So far, the scheme has brought in Rs. 5,000 crore. I am
confident that Non-Resident Indians will take further advantage of this
scheme.

We will have to solve these problems. I know that all of you, especially our
sisters, are feeling the pinch of the rising prices of some commodities. I
understand your problem. Nature is to be blamed more for this than the
Government. But I know that by saying this your burden will not be
lightened. The Finance Ministry and the State Governments will work
together to combat the price rise. I also ask for the cooperation of traders.
They should not indulge in hoarding or profit- making. We will not hesitate
in taking strong measures against such elements. I know that a number of
festivals are coming up in the next few days. My efforts will be able to see
that rising prices do not dampen your festive spirit.

Problem of Corruption

The country faces another problem that of corruption which is eating into
the vitals of the country like cancer. We have decided to fight it. We have
begun the fight from the top. I have not even left out the Prime Minister
from the ambit of the Lok Pal Bill, which was recently introduced in the Lok
Sabha. This has made clear our intentions to fight corruption at the highest
level.

Along with this, we wish to fight corruption in the bureaucracy. Very soon, I
will initiate action to speed up work in the cell in the Prime Minister’s Office
(PMO) which is looking into corruption cases against officials. Removal of
unemployment is an important pledge in our National Agenda. It is affecting
the lives of everyone. Employment is the only way of fulfilling the basic
needs of the people. Creation of schemes for total employment is difficult,
but not impossible. But basic needs and services will have to be produced
by the masses. Science and technology will have to be applied for this.

Government has decided that ten crore people should get employment
opportunities over the next ten years. This means that every year one crore
people should get employment opportunities. A task force will be set up for
this purpose and it will present its report soon.

Reservation for Women

The status of women is a good indicator to judge the progress of a modern
society. We had promised to give women 33% reservation in Parliament
and the Assemblies. We are sorry that we have not been able to fulfill this
so far. We have already decided to provide free education to girls up to
graduation levels. Now we are going to take another major initiative. All
girls at the primary level will be provided books ins their curriculum free of
cost. This will cost Rs. 550 crore to the Government.

Rajrajeshwari and Bhagyashree Yojana

A new Insurance Scheme, “Rajrajeshwari” will be started to provide women
the economic security. Another insurance scheme, “Bhagyashree” will be
started for girls. Both schemes will begin on Diwali Day this year. The
premium for the scheme will be Re. 1 per month. And the policyholder will
be able to get Rs. 25,000 in case of emergency. The full details will be
announced soon.

Speed up Implementation of Reservation in Jobs

Reservation in jobs has already been provided to the Scheduled Castes,
Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes. However, implementation
of these provisions is very slow. My Government’s efforts will be to speed
up the implementation process and to fill the reservation quotas as quickly
as possible. The administration will be made more sensitive and
accountable to these classes.

National reconstruction Force

Youth power is the strength of the nation. It is also the future of the nation.
Many years ago I had read the words of Baba Amte ~Haath lage nirman
mey, nahin mangne, marne.~ (Use your hands to create, not to ask or hit).
This is also our wish. The young girls and boys of India do not have to
extend their hands before anyone, nor do they have to use their hands
against anyone. They should only dedicate themselves to the task of
national reconstruction.

For this purpose, we have decided to form the National Reconstruction
Force (Rashtriya Punarnirman Vahini) which will involve youth from 18 to
35 years of age. This force will focus on basic services in the rural and
agricultural sectors, protection of environment, mass movement for
population, control, fight against drugs, spread of education, uplift of dalit
and tribal women and in the field of sports, art and culture. These youth will
also get honorarium for their work. Initially this scheme will be implemented
in some districts and finally will be extended all over the country.

This scheme will be launched on January 12, 1999 which is the Birth
Anniversary of Swami Vivekanand and which is celebrated as the Youth
Day. I call upon the young men and women of this country to donate one
year of their youth to rejuvenate the nation.

Golden Jubilee Education Development Space

Satellite Scheme

The next millennium is beckoning us. It will be century of Information
Technology. The greatest strength of India is its intellect. India has the third
largest trained manpower in the field of Science and Technology. We will
have to tap this strength. My Government has taken several new initiatives
in the field of Information Technology. It is our ambition that the country
should become a super power in this field.

Keeping this in view I am announcing a new initiative. Space is a new race
an opportunity to look for innumerable possibilities in the coming century.
Space technology has many advantages, which India can utilise to meet
the aspirations of its younger generation. On the basis of the slogan “Jai
Vigyan”, my Government wants to fulfil the dreams of our youth. In this
direction we will start programmes on a new satellite named Swaran
Jayanti Vidya Vikas Antariksh Upagraha Yojana (Golden Jubilee Education
Development Space Satellite Scheme).

The first satellite of this programme - INSAT 3-B - will be assembled and
launched before August 15, 1999 by the Indian Space Research
Organisation (ISRO) within a record time of less than twelve months. Six
transponders of this satellite will be available exclusively to execute
“Operation Knowledge” which aims to provide computer, internet and
computer based education to all the students of the country. All
Universities, engineering and medical colleges, research laboratories and
other centres of higher learning particularly will be linked to the Information
Technology Network before the next Independence Day. This programme
will also fulfil the development related information needs of the states.

Economic and Social Independence

Today 125th birth anniversary celebrations of Maharishi Aurobindo are
coming to a close. He visualized the spiritual, moral and cultural
renaissance of the country. Today we should pledge to fulfil his dreams.

Bharat Ratna Baba Saheb Ambedkar once said that political freedom is
incomplete without economic and social freedom. Today, on our political
Independence Day we cannot forget this moot point. In the half-century
gone by, we have been able to keep intact our political independence but
could not win the battle of economic and social independence. We have not
been able to free the country from the clutches of poverty and
unemployment. The stigma of illiteracy could not be erased. The monsters
of casteism and communalism still are raising their ugly head. Today on
India’s 51st Independence Day, let us pledge to win economic and social
independence.

Cauvery Accord
In the short tenure of my Prime Ministership, I have made an effort to take
everybody along and I have practised the politics of consensus. Take the
example of Cauvery. There was dispute for years on sharing of Cauvery
water among Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Pondicherry. On some
occasions, this dispute took a serious turn. Water is used to extinguish fire
but if water itself is on fire, what could be done! There is a solution. The
solution lies in maturity, harmony, tolerance, patriotism and a willingness to
keep others interest in mind. The recently concluded Cauvery Accord
epitomises all this.

Is it not surprising that a large amount of water of our rivers flows away into
the ocean, while we fight over our share of water? These disputes have
been going on for years. This situation has to be changed. Our rivers,
which link the states of the country, have to link the hearts of the
countrymen too. There is a need to formulate a National Water Policy. We
have promised to formulate such a policy. However, it is possible only with
everybody’s cooperation and patience.

National Agenda for Governance

My Government has been seriously endeavouring to fulfil the promises
made in the National Agenda for Governance. Ours is a coalition and such
Governments have their own character which has to be faithfully adhered
to. We have prepared a common programme that is the national agenda for
our alliance. We have kept all contentious issues out of this arrangement.
We have always held national interest to be above the party and personal
interest.

The country is passing through a transitional phase today. Our political and
administrative system is facing a serious challenge. In such a situation
every party and every leader has to conduct himself with a sense of
responsibility. History will not forgive us for any action which hurts the
nation.
The common man should also ponder over the existing political and
administrative set up. We are faced with some basic issues. Are frequent
elections ins the interest of the country? Is it the nation’s interest to incur
heavy expenditures on frequent elections?

No Compromise on Principles in Pursuit of Power

I have been Prime Minister only for five months. We have a very thin
majority in the Lok Sabha. I am aware of the limitations of the coalition
Government. I am also aware that in today’s system an innocent sage can
be hanged by the power hungry.

I can assure you that I have never compromised on principles in pursuit of
power and I will never do it. Being in power or out of power is the same for
me. I had been in opposition for years and faithfully performed my duties.
My opponents have also commended it. Today, a poem of Dr. Shiv Mangal
Singh Suman comes to mind:

(I am not afraid of victory or defeat; whatever comes my way on the path of
duty, I will accept it as it is and would no task for any favours).

I wish to assure you that till my last breath I will neither ask for favours, nor
give up the path of struggle. I only need your support. I only need the
blessings of one billion of my countrymen. There comes a moment in life
when one stands at crossroads and ponders over the path to take.

(Modesty is being enraged openly and pawn has beaten the queen, should
I take one last gambit or leave it all, which path do I take?).

Then I feel that I cannot go into oblivion leaving the challenges behind. I
have to struggle. Once again, I reiterate my pledge in your presence from
the ramparts of Red Fort.
(I will not accept defeat and will start the struggle afresh. I will write and
unwrite my own destiny and sing a new tune).

Thank you very much. Join me in saying:

the Army, Navy and Air Force, toiling farmers, Workers, my countrymen
living abroad and dear children.
       I congratulate you all on the Golden Jubilee of the Nation's
Independence. I salute those martyrs whose sacrifice won Independence
for the country. My tributes especially to the family members of those
whose patriotism and sacrifice freed the country from the shackles of
British imperialism and gave the country deliverance from century old
slavery and humiliation. We salute the vanguard of freedom fighters whose
efforts are recognised by the whole country.
      On this occasion, I remember with gratitude those innumerable
martyrs who suffered in jail, in anonymity but who always nurtured the hope
to see a free India. I don't know whether you have heard of Ashfaq, Bismil
who gave the message of supreme sacrifice while awaiting the gallows by
saying “Sarfaroshi ki tamanna”. (Urdu couplet) Bhagat Singh, Rajguru and
Sukhdev also had the same song on their lips when they were being led to
the gallows. I on behalf of the nation, salute them, today.
      Last night, the President recalled the contribution of those great
leaders whose sacrifices and leadership ended the slavery of hundreds of
years. The countrymen recall with gratitude the great leaders like Mahatma
Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, Abdul Gaffar Khan,
Netaji Subash Kalam Chandra Bose, Sardar Patel, Babu Rajendra Prasad,
C. Rajagopalachari and founder of our Constitution Dr. Babasaheb
Ambedkar.
      Today we remember those lakhs of families who suffered humiliation
and lost their lives at the time of partition. Ours is an ancient civilization. In
these last fifty years, the culture of this country has been enriched further
and this in itself reflects unity and secularism. Our country is moving
towards modernity while keeping its heritage intact. This is as old and
ancient, as it is young and vibrant. There is a certain attraction in this land
whereby people belonging to different cultures and languages were able to
mingle freely and enrich our civilisation. The greatest contribution of this
country to society is Democracy under which 50 crore voters elect their
representatives from Panchayat to Parliament. We are proud of our
Democracy. On this historic occasion, as I address you from the ramparts
of the Red Fort, which has witnessed several historical events, history is
unfolding before my eyes. As you must have seen last night the Members
of Parliament were listening to the speech of Jawaharlal Nehru which was
delivered 50 years ago. Mahatma Gandhi's voice was inspiring the country,
once again. Netaji who was the symbol of sacrifice has said that freedom
and sacrifice are synonymous. A new India was awakening with fresh
hopes on 15th August, 1947. The first Prime Minister of the country Pt.
Jawaharlal Nehru had reiterated the plea given to the future generations by
the freedom fighters. This commitment which was towards the nation and
its people.
      Fifty years ago, while on the one hand in the Central Hall of the
Parliament the country was looking towards the future with hope on the
other, it was witness to the menace of communalism at its worst in areas
like Punjab and Bengal which were partitioned. In the name of religion,
innocents were being stabbed, women folk were being openly humiliated
and barbarism was at its height. Human values were nowhere in sight.
Lakhs of men and women, old and young and children including myself
were crossing the border from both sides with tears in the eye and smile on
the face, with no hope for the future and darkness behind. Even during this
painful hour, we remembered Gandhiji who inspired us and showed the
path of a secular democratic India even putting his life at stake. It was
assumed and later confirmed by posterity that had we chosen some other
path, the country could not have stayed united or progressed.
      Ours is a country of diversities. We follow different religions and
speak different languages. Quite often our eating habits and life styles also
vary. We have witnessed diverse aspects of history for the last several
centuries. The struggle for Independence has united all these diversities
into a firm chain. The slogan ""Unity in Diversity"" was inscribed firmly in our
hearts. Every word of this meant sacrifice, patriotism and a firm faith in
destiny.
       Gandhiji raised a unique army of soldiers who had no weapons and
they were forbidden from even talk about violence. This was a new
definition of valour given by Gandhiji. People's faith in Gandhiji led the
lawyers to give up practice, students left their schools and colleges and
started filling up jails. Farmers left their fields and labourers their factories.
In the last days of the struggle, things came to such a peak that the youth
working with the Indian Navy also revolted. The country was witnessing a
new kind of revolt. The roots of imperialism were shaken in the face of this
struggle.
       I take pride in this fact and I wish to reiterate that the freedom was
won by the common man of this country -- it was not gifted. It is for this
reason when the Constitution of India was framed, its opening line said,
""We, the people of India give to ourselves this Constitution"". This
constitution and this great country gave us the democracy, fundamental
rights which enshrined equality of religion, caste, creed and gender and it is
under this democratic system that 36 crore people exercised their franchise
in the previous elections, a shining example of the largest democracy of the
world. Gradually the African and Asian nations started attaining freedom.
British imperialism started losing ground after India's independence and we
witnessed the last chapter of British imperialism closing recently in Hong
Kong.
       The struggle for independence started from this Red Fort in 1867 and
later the British imperialists prosecuted the brave soldiers of INA in this
very same Fort. Netaji Subash Chandra Bose gave the slogan ""Lal Qila
Chalo"". Lal Qila became the symbol of India's struggle for freedom. The
freedom fighters used to sing ""Kadam Kadam Badhaye Ja, Yea Zindagi hai
Quam ki, Tu quam pe lutaye ja"".
       Today while addressing you from the ramparts of the same fort and
look back at the history with pride, I also want to speak to you about the
future of the nation. When Gandhiji dreamt of India's future, he had said
that the country will attain the real freedom only on the day when a Dalit
would become the President of this country. This is our great fortune that
today on the eve of golden jubilee of independence, we have been able to
fulfil this dream of Gandhiji. In the person of Shri K.R. Narayanan we have
been able to fulfil the dream of Gandhiji. Our President of whom the whole
country is proud of, is from a very poor and downtrodden family and today
he has endowed the Rashtrapati Bhawan with a new pride and respect. It is
a matter of further happiness that the President has a very high place
among the intellectuals of this country. This is a feather in the cap of our
democracy that the backward sections of the society today are attaining
their rightful place in society. All the countrymen today whether they are
from minorities, scheduled castes or scheduled tribes are working unitedly
for the development of the country.
       Women constitute an important part of our society. Our religions and
cultures put the women folk on a very high pedestal but I am constrained to
say it, with a sense of sorrow and regret that our politics, apparently, is
hesitating in giving the women a place of equality, There was a revolution a
few days back in the Panchayat Raj elections, about one lakh women
rightfully became the leaders of Panchayats and Municipal Corporations.
When I go to any city and meet the lady mayor or the lady sarpanch, I feel
very happy and proud. In this I also see the future of India. These days we
are trying and I want to reiterate the promise which I made in Parliament to
give women their rightful place in the country's politics. We must remember
that unless and until women are given their rightful place, no society or
country can progress. Women should get the equal place in every field
whether in the political, economic or social arena.
       It is very unfortunate that even today in some families when a girl
child is born, they feel bad about it. Unfortunately, some families get the girl
child aborted when they learn about it in advance. My government has
formulated two policies to stop this menace. The first is that doctors have
been legally prohibited from revealing the sex of the child in the womb. The
second policy is perhaps more important, that the government, from today,
itself will give financial help to the families to whom a girl child is born, if
they are living below the poverty line. Later scholarship will be given when
the girl child starts going to school.
      I appeal to all countrymen and political and social institutes and also
to those women who have been recently elected in the Panchayats to work
unitedly to change the atmosphere in the country so that small girls are
looked after well. They should get full opportunity to blossom and men and
women should have equal place in society. This country will become great
only when the men and women of this country work unitedly and take the
country ahead.
        I would also like to say that whether they are boys or girls, unless and
until our future generations go to school, the society cannot make further
progress. My government has already acceded the right to education as a
fundamental right for every child and we have presented the amendment
bill in the Parliament. The next scheme is to open more schools and raise
the standard of education. Our country will have a bright future only when
every child below 14 years will go to school every morning wearing a
colourful uniform. The children should not be deprived of childhood joys
and should not be forced to labour. That is why I want to emphasise that all
of you should contribute your mite in this endeavour of government.
       Now, with great sorrow and seriousness I want to draw your attention
towards the ill of this country which is called corruption. Corruption is eating
into the vitals of the country. The country is in greater danger from those
who occupy higher offices and betray the nation by accepting bribes. If the
country's enemies attack us from outside, our gallant army is capable of
facing them and they put their lives at stake in the most difficult
circumstances. But if somebody from inside becomes a traitor by accepting
bribes and betrays the nation, he creates a greater danger to the country.
The corruption is rampant everywhere. It seems that whether it is a matter
of government purchases, paying of taxes, paying of custom duties, some
people think and that corruption is their birthright. I make a promise to you
that the long arms of law will be further strengthened to ensure that no one
who accepts bribes escapes the grip of the law. I take it as my first and
foremost duty and also as a promise to the nation that an accused, whether
he belongs to politics or government would not be exonerated if he
commits such a sin.
      It is all the more unfortunate that common men face more difficulties
because of petty corrupt practices. Even the slightest of work cannot be
completed without bribing somebody, whether it is a police station, a village
patwari, municipality, an electric station, telephone department or the
revenue department. Everywhere the sin of corruption is there. The
common man especially the poor and the middle class just feel helpless.
On several occasion, I have seen this feeling of helplessness written large
on their faces.
      The nexus between corrupt and politics has taken a turn for the
worse today when criminals are entering politics. When I see the dark
clouds ahead, I feel more determined to eliminate this challenge of
corruption. All of us will have to work unitedly to eradicate corruption.
Government alone will not be able to do this work. When the cancer
worsens we all have to pay attention towards it.
      The first thing which we have to do is electoral reforms which are
being discussed for a long time now. Some work has been done in this
regard but that is not enough and perhaps will not be able to meet the
objectives. Corruption will prevail till the day when money is collected in the
name of fighting elections. Therefore, complete reforms are imperative. The
second thing towards which I have drawn your attention is the
criminalisation of politics. Criminals are aligning with the political parties
and I am here to break the nexus with courage and determination. I
honestly believe that every political party finds fault with the others but
overlooks its own greater faults. If a goonda belongs to the other political
party we consider him a goonda but if he belongs to party we make him sit
by our side and give him respect and regard. Legally we have to meet this
challenge but simultaneously I call upon all political parties to do a soul
searching. This is the biggest challenge before politics and the politician,
today, if he has to become the leader of tomorrow. Last week I had been to
Mumbai to the anniversary of 9th August. There I had said something
which I want to repeat today. The bribe takers should not be allowed to
escape the law but we, who are compelled to offer bribes should take a
pledge and start a new type of satyagraha-non-cooperation — and assert
that we would not give bribes whatever be the difficulties and delays. It will
be a new form of satyagraha.
       This satyagraha can take us very far. Today we do not have any
leader of the stature of Mahatma Gandhi but all of us can unitedly achieve
this objective. The philosophy of Gandhiji is today inspiring us to form
committees in localities, villages and cities to help each other so that those
who give bribe and those who take bribe come out of this compulsion. I
don't know whether some of you remember this or not, I have seen this with
my own eyes that when Gandhiji had started salt satyagraha, people had
their doubts about its outcome and they use to question how it was
possible to remove imperialism by making salt. I recall that when my father
decided to join the salt satyagraha, his fellow lawyers told him that you are
a literate person whereas Gandhi is an old man and he has lost his senses.
They used to ask if it were possible to make British imperialism give way by
making salt. But Gandhiji had confidence in himself. He was a farsighted
man. People followed him. The issue which had started from a handful of
salt ended with the end of British rule, from this very Red Fort.
       I give you my word that my government shall not compromise with
corruption, in any kind of circumstances and I call upon you to help me in
this task. There was a time when taking bribe would lead to social boycott.
It was a matter of great insult if anybody aligned his name with a
bribe-taker. All of us should work unitedly to create an atmosphere in the
society, which would emphasise that we do not vote for the corrupt, we do
not keep any kind of relationship with any criminal and we do not give any
respect to such persons in society.
      The struggle for the country's independence achieved success when
the youth joined it. There was enthusiasm in that commitment and the
same commitment and will to sacrifice led the nation to the freedom. Today
once again, I call upon you to join this new struggle against corruption.
There are some aspects of corruption which relate to the government
policies. My government has taken a decision that whenever there is a big
government purchase, whether it is of defence or some other department,
its procedure should be very transparent so that people do not have any
doubt about it. You must have noticed that a few days back, our Defence
Minister had announced the formation of a committee which will approve
the purchases of arms and fighter planes and other defence equipment.
The members of this committee are people of the highest integrity and the
country have full faith in them. Such committees should be formed in all
Ministries and departments who make large purchases. This committee
should work in an open way so that people can see that there are no
kickbacks involved. There should be nothing in it which even the slightest
measure smells of corruption.
       A few days back, all the Chief Ministers from all over the country had
come to Delhi on my invitation. They had all unitedly had decided that we
will give Right to Information to our people through a new law. Under this
Right, every citizen will have the right to seek information on any of the
contract or purchases. None of the contracts or purchases would be
concealed behind the veil of the Official Secrecy Act. This Right to
Information law is already under formulation and would be presented in the
next session of Parliament. I have also advised the Chief Ministers to form
special courts to expeditiously deal with corruption cases. Some states
have already done it but others have not. This is a very important task and I
have also prayed to the Supreme Court to help us in punishing the corrupt.
      My government has formed a National Commission which would
recommend abolition of outdated laws which are not required now and will
suggest reforms in the present laws to ensure early settlement of cases in
courts. The Civil Code and the Penal Code should be changed so that
cases do not remain in the court files for long years.
      The Lok Pal Bill will be presented in the next session of Parliament
and this will act as another watch tower on official deals. I have noticed that
there are several cases before the CBI which have not yet been opened
and enquiries are continuing. I have told the officers that such cases should
be resolved expeditiously.
       Another thing which I want to tell you, is that if any of you have a
proof against any Minister in my Cabinet, you please come forward and
give it to me. I give you my word that I would order a thorough enquiry into
the complaint without caring for the status of the person concerned and
action would be taken against him under the law. We will not let such
persons remain in politics.
      My countrymen, the Indian community today is emerging as a big
economic giant before the world, after the hard work of fifty long years.
Earlier, even the needle for sewing clothes used to be imported. I recall that
before partition, there was a very rich businessman in Karachi who made a
big fortune by importing needles. Today, when we take a look at our
industries and factories, we raise our head with pride on our achievements
in these 50 years.
      We attained political freedom 50 years ago and today, we have to
march forward towards economic freedom. Our schemes including the 9th
Five Year Plan which will come before you in a few days' time will lead the
country towards the goal of economic independence. The 50 years hard
work of our countrymen has borne fruit. Today the world considers India as
a very big market, a market not for only purchasing goods but market
because of our industries. Our labourers and our farmers are taking the
country on the path of economic progress by their hard work. Today no
country in the world can remain isolated. The United Front government has
formulated a Common Minimum Programme. This programme is
multifaceted and our effort is to touch upon those sectors of the economy
where some kind of stalemate has crept in. You are all aware and you
remember that in the last fifty years this country has strived to set up a
large number of Public Sector Units. Some companies are facing problems
and we are trying to resolve those. Ever since I have taken over I have paid
special attention to Public Sector and where there was talk of closing down
ten big companies, they have been revived. My policy is that as far
possible, Public Sector Companies should be infused with fresh life so that
the country increases its wealth and the people's prosperity.
     Today, whether it is Delhi or outside, within the country or city we
understand that new roads need to be built. Industries have to increase for
which the infrastructure issues like Power, Post & Telegraph and
Telecommunications have to be addressed. Unless we do so our economy
may not be able to progress. That is why the United Front Government is
focussing and stressing on these issues. I am proud to state that our
economy grew at a rate of nearly 7% last year.
       This has happened for the first time in our history that as we attain
new objectives and now we aim even higher. We strive and aspire that
together, with the efforts of labourers and farmers our growth rate should
move towards 10%. Ours is primarily an agricultural economy. The real
strength of the country is the farmer, his effort and production. In the last 50
years our foodgrain production has increased 4 times. Import of foodgrains
for the people is the thing of the past. Our population has increased
tremendously but I am grateful to the farmer for making us self-sufficient in
food-grains. You will be happy to know that with the efforts of our farmers,
our food-grain production was 20 crore tonnes, last year. This includes both
rice and wheat. Our country has experienced both green and white
revolutions. Due to the white revolution, India today is the world's biggest
producer of milk. Our focus today is to improve agriculture production. That
is why the areas that receive scanty rainfall need special attention. In areas
where agriculture is totally dependent on rainfall - dryland farming, the
stress is on improving agricultural production by using science and
technology. We have to do a lot for the hard working farmers, so we have
decided to give special emphasis on the welfare of agricultural labour
especially landless labourers. Since he is backward and in extreme poverty
there is need for his insurance so that in case of his unfortunate demise,
his family members do not lack food. In the field of agricultural reforms
there are some more issues which are under consideration and we will try
to introduce a Bill in the next session of Parliament.
        The slogan of “Garibi Hatao"" was given a long time back. The policy
of my Government is how to translate it into reality. Today I have said that
in our agricultural economy around 60 to 65% people are dependent on
agriculture. It is with extreme sadness that I say that the land reforms have
not been implemented honestly. Our country cannot progress unless the
people who actually work on fields get the land and until the landless
farmer is able. Therefore, I exhort you, especially those states where land
reforms have not been implemented to lay stress on this and to formulate
such a programme that within the next one or two years will translate this
into reality. Poverty and illiteracy are two sides of the same coin and they
should be eradicated. The welfare of the labourer and poor classes should
not be promoted not only with agriculture but by setting up of cottage and
small scale industry. Unemployment especially of the educated
unemployed needs to be addressed. It has only one solution and that is
economic progress and advance. I assure you that our next plan would lay
stress on this. Eradication of illiteracy is another essential ingredient for the
development of the country. The nation cannot progress long as its people
are illiterate. Somebody has once which I would like to repeat that ""Tell me
one country where people are literate and is backward; and tell me one
country where people are illiterate and the country has moved forward”.
        Today we are concentrating on this. I remember the days when I was
in college and Gandhiji had raised the slogan of “Each one teach one"". The
country would greatly benefit if each person - whether he is studying,
working in an office or doing some job in the village decides to teach one
illiterate in a year. I invite you to contribute in this mission. There are some
states in our country which have experienced this revolution. We can talk of
Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Mizoram and Tamil Nadu to a great extent, areas
where we have grappled with illiteracy and it has resulted in decreasing
population rate. An educated woman contributes greatly in this mission. If
an educated woman understands how the growing population can be
stopped, how families can be kept small the danger to our development
due to population explosion can be stopped.
       A short while ago I was talking of science & technology. The Green
Revolution of our country was the direct result of this technology. It is a
matter of pride that thanks to our scientists we can both make and launch
our satellites. There is a new future for the youth of today and science,
technology and computer show a new path. I recall Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru's
statement that it is not enough for everyone to become a scientist or
technologist, it is more important to inculcate a scientific temper among our
children and youth. When a child switches on an electric bulb and asks how
it functions he should not be scolded. He should be made to understand
how electricity is produced and used. When a child acquires a questioning
nature, scientific temper is created and it will eliminate the era of
superstitions.
       Long ago Lord Buddha had said that the people should not have blind
faith in anything. Do not believe because I am saying so. Also do not
believe that it is written in a book. Question everything -- what, why, how,
when, these questions raise our thought process would change and the
country will progress. Today I am proud to share with you that, where 10
years ago this country had pledged its gold to import petrol, today we have
three thousand crore dollars. This is our hard earned money. Our
businessmen have earned it. Our industrialists have earned it. Our
exporters have earned it and a large portion of it has come from the people
who closely watch the economic developments and invest when they find
their capital adequately safe. A substantial contribution has come from
non-resident Indians.
      Today, we all envisage a new future for the country. I am reminded of
Gandhiji's statement which said that he would consider the country to be
free when he can wipe the tears from every eye. It is true that we have
wiped some tears. But we cannot honestly say that today there are no tears
in the eyes of our millions. Today therefore, the major issue before me is
how to eradicate poverty. The poverty of scheduled castes, scheduled
tribes and those below the poverty line irrespective of their religion or faith.
So we need to lay special emphasis on such programmes and plans. As I
was mentioning earlier, at the time of independence, our population was 32
crores and in these 50 years it has increased 3 folds. It is possible that it
will touch 100 crores in the coming few years. It is a fact that despite the
increase in population, there is food for everybody. We have to give special
attention to those who still remain below the poverty line -- whether they
are one third or 25%. We have to try and control the growing population
and there are very strong reasons for this. The biggest reason is poverty
because poverty, illiteracy and low status of women lead to an increase in
population. The Government will present a national population policy and
draft a new law for the same. Today my attention is drawn to slums where
people live in extremely dirty surroundings. Similarly, pollution which is
harming the health of our children is a cause for concern. Some years ago I
had visited Sweden. At that time we felt that poverty alone breeds pollution.
Today we have seen our country falling into a vicious circle. On the one
hand, pollution breeds poverty and on the other hand prosperous people
are causing greater pollution. Their cars emit smoke. They do not pay
attention to this and do not object to accumulating filth in their
surroundings. Therefore, if we all do not come together and try to break this
vicious circle; if we do not fight against pollution the country will not be rid
of filth and disease. The Government has framed a lot of policies for
cleaning the rivers and lakes. These policies have succeeded to an extent
but still a lot of work remains to be done. But I emphasise that if the
Government keeps cleaning rivers and we keep polluting them, the
purpose will be defeated. So we should awaken the people to launch an
anti-pollution campaign and see to it that industries do not emit pollutants.
Neither should fertilizers and insecticides be used in such a way that the
ground water is polluted and it becomes difficult to get clean drinking water.
This is why there is a shortage of clean drinking water. Though we have
had a comprehensive environment policy, my topmost priority and foremost
challenge on the 9th Plan is to provide clean drinking water to everyone.
     The weaker sections of society and I am especially referring to ""safai
karmacharis” are today the most backward sections of society. They have
been denied
social justice so far. The Government has established a ""safai karmachari”
Commission to look into this. The Government is also trying to remove
difficulties of night soil workers. Our attention is especially focussed on
""safai karmacharis”. Our attention is and will be on the backward sections
and their upliftment. It is then that they will achieve economic
independence. This independence will come when people from the
backward classes; safai karmacharis, scheduled castes and scheduled
tribes, receive a place of respect in society. You may have seen that in
many Government offices there is extravagant expenditure. I have decided
to set up a new Commission to look into this.
      I wish to spend a few minutes on India's foreign policy. You know that
the foundations of our foreign policy were laid during our freedom struggle
by Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru. About Gandhiji it was always
said that he was born in India, but his political birth took place in Africa.
That is why we have had strong emotional relations with the nations of
black Africa. When our independence came 50 years ago it was said that
the winds of change would also sweep Africa and the rest of Asia. And
indeed, soon, one by one the countries of Africa and Asia threw off the
yoke of colonialism. These new independent nations came together to
create an organisation called NAM. Our foreign policy was started by
Jawaharlal Nehru. He said an independent nation's foreign policy should
always be independent. That is why India has never been part of any bloc.
When the world has been divided into various blocs India made sure that it
did not get involved in bloc politics. We are proud of our non-aligned foreign
policy.
You may remember that I refused to sign the CTBT, and even today we are
firm on this issue. We will not sign the CTBT under pressure and until the
nuclear weapon states destroy their stockpiles. I can proudly say that I
have given a new direction to our foreign policy. This policy has been
referred to by the media and intellectuals as the Gujral doctrine. Under the
doctrine we wish to improve relations with our neighbours, and we are
progressing towards this. But we have to keep one thing in mind, that while
relations can be improved we will not compromise on our security. Our
armed forces have proved many a time that they can defend the nation if
faced by an outside threat. Our history shows that we have never lost in
wars because our people were not brave. Whenever we lost it was
because we did not have the state of the art weapons. If our opponent had
canons we fought with swords, and this was a mismatch. Our soldiers
could only die displaying the highest bravery, our women folk could commit
jauhar. I give my promise, we will never allow this to happen again. I
promise our Navy, Air Force and Army that they will not remain
technologically backward, and they can face the enemy eye to eye. Our
scientists and technologists are today able to produce weapons which we
do not have to buy from abroad. The cold war has ended. Inimical forces
are becoming friendly today. Therefore our foreign policy lays stress on
regional cooperation with countries in South Asia.
       The region can stand the world if we move forward with the spirit of
sharing. You have witnessed development of new friendly relations with
Bangladesh. Our relations with Sri Lanka have also improved. Our
traditional relationship with Nepal has been further rejuvenated. New levels
of friendship have been established with the States of Bhutan and
Maldives; an environment of friendliness is emerging. We have raised the
concept of regional cooperation. Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan and the Indian
States neighbouring Assam can help each other in progress and this area
which was lagging behind in development since partition can move forward.
       I am happy to announce that recently Nagaland has started its march
towards peace. Ceasefire has been agreed after 30 years of militancy and I
am hopeful that in the days to come peace would be restored in the entire
North-eastern region. But one thing should be clear to all of us that there
would be no compromise with terrorism. People using arms will be strictly
dealt with. The country is eager to welcome back the misguided youths ....
They are our brethren and children and if they give up arms and ask for
their right, we will ensure them.
        Today, I would like to refer to Pakistan also. Recently, Indo-Pak
relationship have improved a bit. It is a matter of satisfaction to a level. We
have already had Secretary-level talks and efforts are on to have a second
round next month. Today after years of confrontation both sides have taken
initiatives towards the establishment of peace. Indo-Pak friendship would
benefit the two countries. It will in fact benefit the entire South-East region
and would enable the Seven Nations in the region to open a front against
poverty and backwardness. I want to state on behalf of India that we want
to establish good friendly relations with the countries of the region including
Pakistan. But we must accept that if friendly relations can be established
only when we do not interfere in the internal affairs of each other and
territorial sovereignty of each country is honoured. Today, India has the
capability to protect its national independence, unity and integrity and there
would be no compromise on secular unity and integrity.
       We want friendship while protecting our territorial integrity. It is a
matter of happiness that the situation has changed in the State of Jammu
and Kashmir. We have succeeded in uprooting terrorism there. Today the
democratically elected Government is in operation. I take satisfaction on
stating that after five to seven years of terrorism, Kashmir has come out of
the dark. The success was achieved only after the people of the State
including women, youth from both Hindus and Muslims set up a front
against terrorism. I, therefore request my neighbouring countries to take a
pledge not to interfere in the internal affairs of each other and to honour
each others' borders. I want to reiterate that India is willing to offer a
number of concessions to the neighbouring countries for their economic
prosperity but there can be no compromise on the issues of sovereignty,
terrorism and secular unity. Our foreign policy has led to further
improvement of relationship with neighbouring countries. Our relationship
with the countries of Asia and Africa, Russia, Japan and China and Korea
have improved. The relationship with China is also improving. You have
witnessed emergence of better relationship with the European powers.
European powers are today making heavy investments in our country. Our
relations with the Americans are old and friendly. Our economic ties with
America have been strengthened and we intend to further improve them.
      I want to give a message to the overseas Indians - they are living far
away from the motherland and are proud of the achievements of India and
have great love for their motherland. My Government would extend fresh
concessions to the Non Resident Indians. These would include
concessions in visa, acquiring of property and children education so as to
further strengthen the emotional ties. Before I conclude, I once again
congratulate my countrymen.
Before concluding, and I am saying this to those friends who may not have
understood me in the language in which I was talking, I only want to say
that I greet you all on this very happy occasion when India is finishing half a
century of its Republic and entering into a new era, an era of progress, an
era of peace, an era of leadership in which it wants to be a foremost
country in economic development, in industrial development, agricultural
development. It also wants to be an example in the world over in social
justice. It wants to uplift all those sections of society which have not been
given their fair deal. We shall give them a fair deal.
       And may I also repeat what I have said at length in Hindi that our war
against corruption is wholehearted, honest and candid and for this we have
to build a massive movement in which we all can join so that corruption,
both in politics, politicians and also in public life, ends. And at the same
time, this movement must focus on small corruption, in police station, in
villages, in government offices where we must start a new type of
Satyagrah, that Satyagraha - non-cooperation with the ones who are
corrupt; refusing to give into corruption. It needs courage. Sometimes, it is
difficult but it is daring. Gandhiji's main heritage is this: That non
cooperation can achieve wonders. Let us achieve it once again.
      And also on this occasion, once again, I want to express my feelings
of gratitude to the freedom fighters and also on behalf of the nation I want
to thank them and also appreciate their sacrifices. I want to tell them with a
sense of gratitude that the United Front Government has decided that
whatever small, meagre - what is called pension is given to them, it is being
doubled from today. And also it is being linked with the DA Index so that if
the prices go up, so shall their pension. I hope, and I pray that the veteran
freedom fighters will accept the nation's small gift on this happy day.
     Last year, standing from here, my worthy colleague Shri Deve
Gowdaji had made a promise about Uttarakhand. I want to restate that
promise. We will take the needed steps in this direction very soon.
And in the end, once again, our attention to national unity, to secularism, to
our shared civilisation, to our common civilisation, “Sanjhi Sanskriti”
“Mustaqa Ganga Jamuni Tehzeb”.
       We, the 96 crore Indians, professing different languages, living in
different parts of India, having different historical division, we are one. We
shall remain one.
      We are all moving together and are now standing on the threshold of
greatness. India is about to enter this new edifice of greatness which is
waiting for us. It is waiting for our future, younger generation.
      So today, let us come together and pledge to build a nation which will
be united in spite of the diversities, different languages, are there but it will
remain united. We will follow our faith, our own religions but will remain
united. We will end class differences. We will build a nation where there will
be no lower class or upper class, a nation where women will be honoured.
And they will get their due.
      We shall make a country, a country of equals; a country which is
socially just; a country where woman gets her status, where the scheduled
castes and scheduled tribes and minorities occupy a place of primacy.
     So the same song comes to my mind which we sang yesterday night.
“Sare Jahan se Achha, Hindustan Hamara”. And before concluding this
speech, all of you would join me with full strength to say “Jai Hind”."
1996,H.D. Deve Gowda,Janata Dal,NA,NA,"Prime Ministers of India's Independence Day and Other Speeches (Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru to Dr. Manmohan Sing), Vol 2. Edited by K.V. Singh. Vista International Publishing House, Delhi, India",NA,"Brothers and sisters and dear countrymen, my greetings to all of you
on the Independence Day. I will attempt to speak to you in Hindi. I
remember as a student being inspired by the address of Pandit Jawaharlal
Nehru from this historie Red Fort on this very day. He described himself as
the first servant of the Indian people. I stand before you as a humble
servant of the nation.
      I come from a small farmer's family. I never imagined that I would
address the nation as Prime Minister from Red Fort. It is a tribute to our
Constitution and democratic process that this opportunity has been given to
me - a farmer's son.
      Mahatma Gandhi's call for freedom struggle evoke warm response
from the people in our country belonging to regions, identities and
persuasions. He won independence us. On this day we pay homage to all
the leaders and of our freedom movement.
    We must remember the sacrifice of the Father of Nation. The way
Gandhiji led the freedom movement, it
brought oneness to the nation. The beauty of this unity is that it is not only
geographical or historical, it is based upon the conviction that this nation
belongs to all its people and its plural and secular character.
      Century after century the word “Bharat” has evinced this oneness and
Indian identity in every language in the country and in the heart of every
Indian. A Sanskrit composition, which is known throughout the country
reads -- Tham varsham Bharatam, Bharatiya Yatra Santati -- Those who
dwell within this great land, whatever be their creed or colour, whatever
may be their religion, all belong to this country. They are all Indians.
      This is our heritage, this is our history, and this is our civilization.
      Whenever we surrendered this oneness - which is based on the
principles of pluralism and secularism - and resorted to fanaticism, our
country suffered and declined. The greatest need now, as in the past, is to
foster tolerance and goodwill among all our countrymen.
      We have formulated a Common Minimum Programme to run our
government.
       In this programme, we have resolved that we will take important steps
for the prosperity of our country and improvement of the living standards of
the people.
      I come from rural India where most of our brothers and sisters live. I
have seen poverty and deprivation from close quarters. I know the
problems of the common man. I deem it a privilege and duty to launch this
new agenda.
     Our Government has resolved that we will make special efforts to
improve the quality of life of our rural people.
       Our government is truly in consonance with the glorious Indian
tradition and heritage. Our democracy is mature enough to provide a stable
and strong Government within the federal culture and polity.
       The Government is based on federalism, decentralisation and social
justice and we will ensure the dignity of both the nation and every citizen.
     It is the duty of every citizen of India to update and protect the
sovereignty, unity and integrity of India. It is the duty of each one of us to
preserve the rich heritage of our composite culture.
       The Government will take all steps to ensure that harmonious
relations are maintained between different communities and groups.
     We are committed to protecting the lives and property of all the
people, particularly the weaker sections and the minorities.
     I visited Punjab recently and was impressed by the determination with
which it had fought terrorism and kept the wheels of progress moving. I
congratulate the brave and enlightened people of Punjab on this
achievement.
       I am deeply disturbed by a few recent incident ethnic violence and
avoidable conflicts between different sections of society, in which some of
our brethren and sisters - even children lost their lives. My heart goes out to
their families. We shall provide them with all support and sustenance
bearing with their tragic loss.
      Violence manifesting itself in separating extremist, criminal and
anti-social activities has no place in our society. It will be firmly dealt with by
the Government.
      Jammu & Kashmir is an integral, part of India and will remain so
forever. The people of Jammu & Kashmir are our own people, they are
Indians. This situation prevails from centuries.
      You are aware, the problems in Kashmir are entirely those created by
external forces.
     There should be no doubt in any quarter about our resolve to
preserve the territorial integrity of India.
      I visited Jammu and Kashmir twice and met the people of the State,
and felt their aspirations. The conditions are changing there. The holding of
elections to Parliament in Jammu & Kashmir is a triumph of our democratic
values. The people of Jammu & Kashmir have demonstrated their maturity
and wisdom by rejecting militancy abetted from across the border.
      Building on these positive developments and mood of the people, we
are holding the assembly elections in the State next month.
     We will complete the task of restoration of normalcy and return of a
popular Government in Jammu & Kashmir.
     The North-Eastern region of India requires special attention and
support in the containment of violence, ethnic strife and insurgency.
     Efforts will be made for the well-being of the people of the area and
redressal of their grievances.
     Firm steps will be taken to check the inflow of foreign migrants and
arms together with effective administration.
      In our view, providing clean and efficient administration is the need of
the hour and all of us should be committed to this goal.
     Probity and accountability have to be the key norms in public life and
governance.
       The primary task is to reduce as much as possible the scope for
arbitrary and discretionary decision making.
      Our procedures should be made simpler and more transparent.
      We have begun taking steps to fulfill our commitments to provide a
corruption free and clean administration.
      Our mechanisms and agencies for combating corruption have to be
strengthened and made more effective.
      Corruption, especially in high places is rightly a matter of widespread
concern among the people. We must build and strengthen the institutions
that would deter corruption and restore the confidence of the common man
in our democratic system.
      The proposal to appoint a Lok Pal has been discussed for several
years. We are making this institution a reality by introducing a Bill in the
Parliament.
      We are committed to bringing about sweeping reforms in our election
system. We will examine all important suggestions that have been made for
electoral reforms. The aim of these reforms should be to eliminate the role
of money and muscle power, removal of other unfair practices and ensuring
accountability of the political parties.
      As a beginning we have made amendments in electoral laws which
provide for deterrent punishments for some electoral offences such as
booth capturing, discourages non-serious candidates and reduce the
campaign period.
      Formation of a separate state is a long pending demand of the people
of Uttarakhand. Our Government has taken an important decision to fulfill
this demand. We will shortly introduce a Bill for the formation of
Uttarakhand state.
      As per the provisions of the Constitution this Bill would be placed
before the State Legislature after the ensuing Vidhan Sabha Elections in
U.P. for their views. Later this Bill would be placed before the Parliament so
that the State of Uttarakhand could be formed soon.
     We believe that this decision of the Government will fulfil the hopes
and aspirations of the people of Uttarakhand.
     In today's world, there is no substitute for higher economic growth.
The strength and stability of a nation depends upon the growth of its
economy.
       This is also essential for achieving our cherishment goals of
self-reliance, modernisation and the eradication of poverty. We should
learn to use the opportunities thrown up by the international, technological
and financial developments.
     Our task now is to release the creative energies to the people by
shedding outdated controls and regulations.
     Focus upon the well-being of the poor is an essential part of our
economic philosophy. It is necessary to ensure that the fruits of growth
reach the poor and the inequalities in incomes and opportunities are
narrowed.
     While promoting industrial growth, we cannot neglect Agriculture.
Without high agricultural development, it will not be possible for us to
achieve either rapid economic growth or the removal of poverty.
     High economic growth can be achieved not by shout slogans but by
determined efforts to provide more watt electricity, roads, new
technologies, fertilizers and adequate credit.
        We have already initiated steps to increase investment in agriculture.
The prices of phosphate and potassic fertilizers have been brought down
considerably by increasing the quantum of concession given on these
fertilizers. This will increase the output of our farmers and lead to their
economic betterment.
      Farmers need more water for their lands. We will involve a National
Policy on water sharing and, water management.
      There are several issues relating to sharing and use of water and
resettlement of people affected by irrigation projects. These issues need to
be resolved through negotiations in the best interests of the nation.
      The recent Agreement reached by Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh,
Maharashtra and Rajasthan on the Sardar Sarovar Project shows how
such issues can be resolved through discussions.
      I am concerned that we have not been able to provide basic minimum
services to our people, especially the poor living in the rural and urban
areas even after so many years of independence.
     The faith and the confidence of our people in the ability of the
Government, will ultimately depend on our providing these services to
every citizen.
       I had convened a Conference of Chief Ministers in Delhi last month in
which it was decided that there should provisions of Safe Drinking Water
for all in rural and urban areas; Primary Health Care facilities for all
University and Primary Education; Housing Assistance for all poor families
without shelter and more all weather roads for villages.
       There should be provision for Mid-day Meals in Primary Schools in
the villages and urban slums.
      The Conference decided to draw up programmes to achieve concrete
results by the year 2000.
     More money will be spent on Basic Minimum services and
development of drought and desert and for the welfare of Scheduled
Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Minorities.
      The people living in urban slums have not received adequate support
in the past for their housing civic amenities. We are making a provision of
Rs. 250 this year for this purpose.
     There will be greater involvement of the State implementation of
these programmes.
     We will enhance the provision for rural development.
     The jurisdiction of Panchayati Raj provision has been extended and
more powers have been given to them.
     Our economy provides ample new opportunities for productive work,
especially in self-employment. The educated youth from poor families can
benefit immensely from these opportunities.
     At present there are several schemes for self-employment. We
propose to introduce a unified self-employment programme for educated
unemployed youth in rural and urban areas to benefit 10 lakh youths in
1996-97.
      They will be provided training facilities and enhanced subsidy and
credit support. This step would benefit our youth in large numbers
irrespective of caste, religion or any other differentiation.
    I am particularly concerned about the artisans, craftspersons,
weavers and fishermen, who should also benefit from new opportunities.
     At present, there is a scheme to provide a minimum of 100 days
employment in a year to anyone seeking work from poor households. This
scheme is operating in only 5 out of every 10 blocks in the country.
      Our Government will extend the scheme to cover all blocks within the
next two years.
        The functioning of the Public Distribution Systems has been widely
criticised. It has failed to serve the people of several States. We have now
decided to extend, in a manner, the Public Distribution System to provide
up to 20 kilograms of rice and wheat every month to the poor families on
half the normal price.
     The scheme will come into operation from ""Gandhi Jayanti” 2nd
October, 1996 and when fully implemented 34 crore poor people will be
benefited.
     Our Government symbolizes the empowerment of the downtrodden,
the Scheduled Castes, the Scheduled Tribes and the backward classes.
We want to enhance their dignity and self-confidence.
     The Central and State Governments will have to take steps for
bringing economic freedom, education and more opportunities for them.
     Most people belonging to these groups are even landless or small
farmers. Their land is unproductive because of the lack of land
development and irrigation. This had to attended to.
        We have decided to introduce a “Ganga Kalyan"" Scheme for
providing assistance to poor cultivators belonging to scheduled castes and
scheduled tribes and other backward classes. They will be given upto Rs.
50,000 per hectare for land development, horticulture and irrigation
facilities.
       One of the most vulnerable sections of the society continue to be
women, who constitute nearly half of our population. We should not neglect
their right to get their due share in the Governance of the country. We have
already announced our plan to reserve one third of the seats in State
legislature and the Parliament for women. A similar initiative to reserve one
third of the posts for women in Government is also under consideration.
     Although a comprehensive law has been passed by Parliament,
opportunities for persons with disabilities, are not uniform. We are
committed to effective implementation of the Law for the Protection of
Rights of the Disabled in consultation with the State Governments.
       In each State there is need for an apex institution for training and
basic rehabilitation services. Similarly, in every district, a centre for
rehabilitation of the people affected by various disabilities, and vocational
training facilities is needed.
      We shall take steps to ensure that reservations in employment for
disabled persons are uniformly implemented and welfare measures aimed
at them are improved.
     Groups of disabled persons living in the villages will be organised into
“Sangams” and a sum of Rs. 15,000 will be made available to each such
“Sangam"" for suitable economic activities.
     We have the distinction of being the biggest democracy in the world.
We are proud of it.
     Many of the gains of development are offset due to unchecked
growth in our population. Some States like Haryana and Punjab have
achieved commendable results in reducing population growth.
      It is important that in all other States people and the Government
work together to achieve tangible results in promoting the small family norm
so that the gains of development reach everybody.
      On this occasion, I salute our Armed Forces, who are bravely
performing their duty in different parts of our country, many times under
conditions of extreme hardship. We are proud of their achievements and
dedication to service.
      We will maintain the morale, equipment and readiness of our security
forces at the highest level.
      We take this opportunity to pay tribute to our Defence services and
security forces for the sacrifices they have made for the country.
      We have to take note of the induction of the new sophisticated arms
in our vicinity.
     I want to assure the country that meeting of the security needs is a
matter of priority for us.
       We shall not compromise on issues of defence and nation security.
       Our indigenous capability will be enhanced and strengthened in every
way.
      We have made progress in building our own tanks, our own combat
aircrafts and developing our missiles like Agni and Prithvi. All these
programmes will be continued within the framework already established.
      A word about the good work done by our scientists: not only have
they contributed to our defence capability, but also to our civilian
programmes.
     Space research is an area where we can be justly proud of what we
have achieved. In March this year we achieved the second successful
launch of our Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle which placed a remote-sensing
satellite in the space. We are among a handful countries in the world that
have this capability.
      Our foreign policy is dedicated by our national interests. These are
wide-ranging and include establishing our ability to influence the external
environment.
      Our priority is to evolve better relations with our neighbours.
       We seek actively to promote cooperation both bilaterally and within
the framework of the South Asian Association of Regional Cooperation.
      We are willing to settle all outstanding issues through dialogue and
call upon our neighbours to response positively.
      We are active members of the United Nations. We have made signal
contributions to the Peace-keeping operation of the UN and have
vigorously promoted the social and economic agenda of the UN.
    We believe we have a legitimate claim to serve as a permanent
member of the expanded Security Council.
     The Security Council should truly reflect the expanded membership of
the UN and developing countries must be included as permanent
members.
    Global security today demands a universal appraisal to disarmament.
We have concluded treaties for the elimination of chemical and biological
weapons.
      It is now necessary to tackle nuclear weapons, and last remaining
category of weapons of mass destruction. Visualised the Comprehensive
Test Ban Treaty as apart process of global nuclear disarmament, leading to
the complete elimination of all nuclear weapons, within reasonable time
horizon. This, the nuclear weapon States are unwilling to accept and are
seeking to perpetuate their monopoly on nuclear weapons. We cannot
agree to this.
     We have also to take note of the open as well as clandestine nuclear
programmes in our immediate neighbourhood. Therefore, we have made it
clear that India will oppose a Test-ban Treaty that imposes unacceptable
conditions on us. The country is behind us in our stand and we will not
compromise in matter of national security.
     Countrymen, we are today entering the 50th Year of our
Independence. The time has come for all of us to take stock of our
successes and failures.
      The achievements since Independence - and there are many and
they should encourage and inspire us to do more to take the nation
forward.
     The mistakes committed in the past should make us ask where we
went wrong. The successes should not go to our head because a lot
remains to be accomplished. The mistakes and failures should not
discourage us and push us into a state of inertia.
       The world is changing fast and is not going to wait for us to catch up.
We have to shed our complacency and move ahead so that India can find
its rightful place in the world.
     This is a crucial moment in our history. The nation is poised to
emerge as a strong economic power in the next few years.
      The people have to remain alert and protect the honour and dignity of
the nation. Our forefathers have told the Mantra of self-reliance. We have
learnt to depend essentially on our own resources. There are external
pressures and internal problems. If the Situation warrants then the country
should stand up as one to face any such crisis.
      A century of freedom struggle and the experiences since
Independence have given us the confidence that a bright and prosperous
future can be built.
      Our biggest asset are the people - 95 core of them whether they are
working in fields producing foodgrains, as skilled workers in industrial
plants, or scientist in laboratories, or jawans guarding our frontiers, or the
youth they are all contributing to the collective effort to build a strong India.
      When a great nation wakes up and begins to move ahead nothing
can stop it in its tracks.
    We are drawing close to the end of an even a century which saw the
awakening of the nation. We now prepare ourselves for the 21st century.
      It is the duty of the Government, every political party, the intelligentsia
and all citizens of the land to seize this great moment and build a new
India. I have great faith in the people of India. We should all look to the
future with hope, courage and self-confidence.
      On this historic day, I appeal to all countrymen to resolve to work for
an India where every citizen - irrespective of caste, creed and religion - can
hold his or her head high.
      I now invite you to join in raising the national slogan with me: Jai
Hind, Jai Hind, Jai Hind."

Independence Day. I offer my best wishes for the betterment of our country
and the world as a whole. May you all live happily and the country move
ahead on the path of progress.
      You are aware of the tremendous changes taking place the world
over in recent years, the maps of several countries have been redrawn.
Such has been the magnitude of the changes in these countries that we
cannot even recognise the picture which has now emerged. We are also
trying to keep pace with this changing world. At the same time we do not
want and, in fact, we cannot give up our intrinsic values. As Mahatma
Gandhi said, freedom does not mean mere change of masters; the
essence of freedom lies in changing the lot of Daridranarayan — our poor
brethren. I would like to assure you that we have been following and will
continue to follow the same mission. This is the policy of the Government.
      This Government has been in office for a little more than three years.
Many things have happened during these years and I have been informing
you about them from time to time. The overall picture that emerges will
make it clear that during these three years considerable progress has been
made. On the whole, peace and harmony prevails in the country and
people are busy in their work — in the task of development and country's
progress. We have made and are making sincere efforts to solve the
problems. Nor will there be any slackening of such efforts in future.
       Punjab is peaceful. The State continues to hold the first position in
the field of foodgrains production and in many other fields of development.
The problem of Assam has been resolved. There was some problem
regarding Bodoland but that too is being tackled. Some agitations and
disturbances are taking place there, but that should not cause undue worry.
     In our North-Eastern States there are occasional disturbances.
Sometimes our tribal brothers inhabiting that region clash with one another.
But on the whole, the situation is fully under control.
      Now, let me speak about Kashmir which, for some time has been a
problem for us. Though there has been considerable improvement in the
situation, it has not reached the level of normalcy as yet. The reason is not
very far to seek. Everybody knows, how Pakistan has been actively
encouraging terrorism in the State from across the border, how it has been
training the terrorists on its land and giving them financial help, how it has
been arming and then sending them across the border into the State. There
is no doubt about this. For so many years, we have been collecting
evidence of the misdeeds of Pakistan, bringing that to the notice of the
countries friendly to us and telling them what Pakistan has been doing all
these years. Now, after 14th August, 1994, I think no further proof is
required when they have themselves openly declared that they would
continue their help to the terrorists in Kashmir, give them arms and send
reinforcements. They have said that this would continue forever.
       I would like to ask these friendly countries, “Respected friends, what
do you say now? Till yesterday, you believed us only partially. Sometimes
you would tell us that perhaps Pakistan had earlier been doing it but not
now?"" Only recently, I had had occasions to listen to this kind of talk in
some of the countries I visited. Now I want to ask them if they still have any
doubt about it. So it is very obvious that Pakistan does not want to stop
these activities. Instead, it has openly announced before the world that it
would continue with them. Our reply can only be that we are also not going
to sit back until we have completely rooted out this blatant interference in
our internal affairs. It is our resolve and we want to make this clear to them.
      Meanwhile, we have taken several steps in Kashmir to bring peace to
the State and to identify the terrorists. I say “terrorists', for no other word
can befit them. They have been mercilessly killing people, especially
opinion leaders of the State -- lawyers, doctors and religious leaders.
Recently they also killed the Assembly Speaker. Their victims include staff
of media installations, like All India Radio and Doordarshan. They killed the
Vice-Chancellor of a university. They have been killing government
servants who are simply performing their duties and who have nothing to
do with politics. And there is no count of innocent civilians being killed by
them. How would you describe these heinous acts? What else is it, if not
terrorism? I have no other word to describe this. But you can rest assured
that we will completely wipe out terrorism.
       Recently, we have taken several initiatives in J & K for accelerating
the pace of development and boosting the morale of the civil administration
terrorised by guns. I may tell you that we are going to take up the revision
of electoral rolls shortly. We are also engaged in delimiting the
constituencies for conducting elections. This clearly shows the direction in
which we are moving. We are moving towards holding elections in the
State. I don't want to give you any specific date because that might unduly
provoke the terrorists to indulge in more violence. But there is no doubt
about the direction in which we are moving. Now when we have been doing
all this, we would expect the international community to take note of it and
to see who is the one actually trampling the human rights. They will have
an opportunity to judge this.
        It is very unfortunate that not only something bad is done but it is
openly declared that what they are doing is good and that they will continue
to do the same in future also. This type of language does not behove
friends. I want to appeal to Pakistan, please accept the hand of friendship
we have extended. There can be several meeting grounds between us.
Sometimes differences may crop up, but they can be resolved. I would
however, like to make it clear to Pakistan, you may or may not cooperate
with us, but, 'with you, without you, in spite of you’ Kashmir will remain with
us. It is an integral part of India. This will not change, never, not in the least.
They say they are a nation of twelve crores. If they talk of crores, you can
understand what my answer would be. However, it is not a question of
crores; it is a question of justice, it is a question of law and the Constitution.
You cannot negate all this and reverse the course of history. The sooner
we all realise this, the better it is for us. This is what I want to convey.
      Let us now look at our economic scenario. I have been telling you
from time to time about the progress we have made during the three years.
Today the situation in our country is not as it was in 1991. It has improved a
lot. We have foreign exchange reserves worth Rs. 51,000 crore. Just
imagine, in 1991, we had foreign exchange worth only Rs. 3,000 crore. It is
no mean achievement. You can imagine to what extent the
creditworthiness of our country has gone up. Not only this, we have even
repaid the IMF loan well in advance, so that we may be spared of interest
liabilities to that extent. We told our creditors that we have the money now
and we want to repay, which you should accept. We would borrow when
we are in need. Has it ever happened before? This has happened in a very
few countries. In India also, when Indiraji was the Prime Minister, it
happened once and after that this has happened a second time, that is this
year.
       I want to tell you that this is ample proof of our creditworthiness, our
solvency: As a result of the confidence that world has come to have in
India, investments are flowing into our country from abroad. Large
industries are being set up. Only a few days back, we have cleared a
foreign project for power in Maharashtra worth about Rs. 8000 crore. I
would like to have another ten or twelve such projects to come to our
country so that the resources available with us are spared. If such projects
had not come, and we had not got funds in the country, the Government
would have been obliged to raise the money by taxing you, because we
cannot do without electricity. The amount we have saved now, will be spent
for the poor, for the children, for the repair of schools, for the programmes
relating to education, health and other facilities. I have been emphasising
this time and again. Today I am placing before you a concrete example.
       A beginning has been made and more projects of similar nature are
coming in because people abroad have come to have confidence in India,
in its stability, in its economy, in its law and order situation, and they are
convinced that there is no risk of losing their money invested here. Instead,
they would earn profits. Whilst they earn profits, we are also benefited.
People get jobs; our engineers, doctors and thousands of educated
persons get employment. Therefore, we would like this process to continue.
Ours is a big country. Just one project will not make any impact. If a project
comes up in Maharashtra, people in Assam do not think much of it. So it
has to come in Assam as well. It has to be in Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra,
Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and other regions. In fact, when such big projects
come up in all the States, then only it will have an impact and we shall
realise what industrialisation means in the real sense of the term.
       The investments coming from abroad are not going to deprive us of
our freedom. Indian company and Indian partners are investing in such
projects along with foreigners. That means our people have a share in
them. About 80 per cent of the foreign investments are joint ventures.
Therefore, it is entirely fallacious to say that we would be swallowed up.
These projects have investments both from Indians and foreigners. Nobody
will shift them anywhere else. If the projects come here they will not be
compromised in any way. And we really need these projects and
investments in the power sector, in oil industry, in metallurgical industry,
which are most essential. They are coming in electronics, chemicals and
other areas of our priority.
      Now I come to agriculture. God has been kind to us. We have had
good rains and consequently good harvests for the last three-four years.
Our farmers have created a miracle. No other country has, perhaps,
witnessed a revolution of this kind.
       But we are faced with a problem now. You may not perhaps believe
it, but it is a fact that when the Kharif crop is harvested in a couple of
weeks, we shall have no space to store the paddy. I had said this earlier
also. Today I have got the statistics. You may not perhaps be aware that as
on date we have 3.25 crore tonnes of foodgrains in our stock. We do not
have enough storage facilities. So, the foodgrains from the new harvest will
have to be kept in the open. It may result in some loss, but we are helpless.
I would like to utilise foodgrains for our children and students who live in
hostels. I have to see that at least 10 to 15 lakh tonnes are out of the
godowns for use, so that we have space to store the foodgrains from the
new crop. Old stocks are in quite good condition and we want to use them.
As of now, there seems to be no chance for exporting them. So we would
like to use them for our own people. We want to give some wheat to
Modern Food Industries. They have assured us that if we give them wheat,
a rupee cheaper, they will proportionately reduce the price of bread they
manufacture out of it. We want to give them the surplus wheat so that the
price of bread comes down.
      We have our Integrated Child Development Scheme. The Anganwadi
Programme for villages has not yet reached all of them. We propose to
spread it throughout the length and breadth of the country in a couple of
years. In order to enhance the nutritive value of the food served to these
children, we would like to give some more wheat out of our stocks. We
have in our country thousands of hostels in which mostly students from the
poorer sections, including those belonging to Scheduled Castes,
Scheduled Tribes and Backward Classes, reside. They have no means to
avail of the facilities of private hostels, so they live in government hostels.
Some States have large numbers of such hostels, in which thousands of
students live. We would like to provide them more nutritious food and we
shall do so out of the surplus stocks with us. In this way, we may be able to
dispose of 10 to 15 lakh tonnes of stock which will, at the same time,
benefit the students and the tiny tots covered by the Integrated Child
Development Scheme.
       We are chalking out this programme, the implementation of which will
start in a few days. We are trying to solve our problems in this way — not
by exporting our foodgrains but by providing more nutrition to our own
people.
      As you know, we have started the revamped Public Distribution
System (PDS) in about 1800 blocks two years back. This scheme has been
operating quite well. We would like to provide more foodgrains through the
PDS at cheaper prices and overcome the shortcomings which has been
there in this system. Towards this end we have constructed several
godowns, provided a number of vehicles to the State governments to carry
foodgrains to the remote areas. It is a gigantic programme. There is no time
to go into details, but I may say that a programme of such dimension has
not perhaps been undertaken earlier. And we propose to expand it further
by covering more blocks. We would like to cover about 200 more blocks
and eventually spread the programme all over the country.
       You are aware of the huge amount we have provided for rural
development. You must have heard many times that we have allocated Rs.
30,000 crore in this Five Year Plan and more than Rs. 7000 crore is being
given in one year. People come to me from villages and tell me that they
have never seen so much money coming to their villages from Delhi.
Presently as much as Rs. 40 to 50 crore are at the disposal of each of the
District Collectors. It is being used for public works. We feel that a
revolution is under way, in fact it is taking place there, in every village. Now
Panchayats are being set up in villages under a new law and much of this
money will go to them. They would take up the implementation of
development works and schemes for the welfare of the people according to
their priorities.
       I may assure you that now paucity of funds would not be felt that
much. But now the local people, local leadership of the Panchayats will
have to supervise how the money is spent. Nobody from here would
supervise that. At times people from here may go but that would not help. It
is the local people who will have to oversee how the money is being used.
Later on, nobody should complain that the money was not spent properly.
Therefore, I want to warn you in advance that people in all the villages and
the youth should be on their alert in this regard. This programme will run
very smoothly, if Sarpanchs and other members of Panchayats discharge
their responsibilities properly. We intend to provide more money for this in
the next Five Year Plan.
      I had announced three new schemes last year from these ramparts.
As you know, we have been continuing several schemes which were
started by Rajivji—Jawahar Rozgar Yojana, Nehru Rozgar Yojana, Indira
Awas Yojana. Several schemes of this type started by him continue to be
implemented with full vigour. Simultaneously, I had announced three new
schemes last year and these schemes are also progressing very well. One
of the three schemes is ‘Mahila Samriddhi Yojana' which is for our sisters.
You will be surprised to know that within a year, rather within 8-9 months,
13 lakh women, 13 lakh of our sisters, have opened their own accounts in
post offices. You may say 13 lakh is not a big number where crores live.
But you should try to appreciate the significance of 13 lakh women going to
the post offices on their own and opening their accounts within 8 months in
their own name. It means that they have liked this scheme a lot and they
are very enthusiastic about it. I may add here that out of these 13 lakh
women, at least 2 lakh belong to Scheduled Tribe areas which shows how
far this awakening has reached and how far it is about to reach.
       Some of the States have done very well in this regard, though some
others have done very little work under this scheme. Rather, I should say,
some have not yet started on this. I would like to appeal to the Chief
Ministers of these States that we have had enough of quibbles and
quarrels. This programme is above party politics where there is no room for
rivalry. This is for the common good of the people, for the good of the
women. I would appeal them to go ahead, and implement the scheme by
asking their people, their party, their followers, their youth that when other
States have been working on this, why should it not be implemented in
ours.
       Another programme is for rural employment. You know, people in
their own villages do not have work for all the 365 days. Our programme is
to provide them employment at least for 100 days in a year. It is being
implemented very well. According to reports we are receiving, things have
improved a lot. Wherever this programme has been launched, people have
stopped migrating to the cities during the lean period because we have
started many types of work-like construction of roads, small tanks, school
buildings. On the one hand people and the villages are being benefited by
these construction works and on the other hand a lot of employment
opportunities are being generated.
      The third programme is for the youth — the urban youth, who have
studied only up to 8th standard, 9th standard or matric. The programme is
to provide a loan of one lakh of rupees to each such young person. This
amount contains a subsidy of Rs. 7,500. The youths are to be trained for
running small business ventures like bicycle repair workshop, shops and
the like. Last year, we set a target to give assistance to 40,000 youths. I am
happy that about 32,000 or 33,000 youths have received the amount and
training under the programme and are now engaged in their work.
      This year we want to increase the number of beneficiaries to two
lakhs. Funds have been arranged for this. Once again I would like to
request the States which have not taken up the programme, to take it up
and implement. I would not like to name such States in public as it is not
done. The States which have taken up the programme have done very well
and I congratulate them. At the same time I appeal to the Chief Ministers of
the States where it has not been taken up to implement the programme.
Funds are there, provision has already been made, and only attention is
needed to make the programme work.
       The three programmes are making good progress. We thought about
some other programmes, which could be implemented by us. I feel that
there are certain programmes, which can be undertaken. A programme for
children could not be taken up last year. Now we want to include it. You
know that there are around 20 million children in our country who should be
attending schools but are not doing so. They are working in factories to
increase the income of their parents. Working in the factories means end of
their education and the children's development forever. It is a fact which we
have to accept. This is unfortunate for our coming generations. We have,
therefore, said that the young children working in occupations such as quilt
making, carpet weaving, which are very hazardous, and tell adversely upon
their health should be withdrawn from there and enrolled in schools. They
have to be educated, they have to be trained in various crafts and such
vocations which may enable them to earn their livelihood later. We are
taking up this programme. There are about 20 lakh children engaged in
such hazardous vocations, that tell upon their health adversely. We want to
withdraw them from such industries and put in schools in the course of next
four-five years.
       The only way to achieve this aim is to provide the parents of such
children full employment to increase their incomes because the parents are
so poor that they cannot sustain themselves without additional income
earned by the children. If such parents are provided full employment and
their income is raised, there is no reason why they should not be sending
their children to school willingly. But they are helpless and we are trying to
rid them of their helplessness. The new programme aims at improving the
prospects of the children whose life may be ruined because of their early
employment in hazardous industries. The programme announced today will
be implemented shortly. All the arrangements have been made.
       I want to talk about another programme. In bigger cities there are
municipal corporations. They get funds and also have other sources of
income. So far as villages are concerned, we have already made adequate
provisions. But there are smaller towns with a population ranging from
50,000 to 150,000. They are neither cities nor villages. They are beset by
the ills of both. There is no agency to look after the well-being of these
towns. Since they do not have enough income to provide civic amenities,
their condition is becoming worse. People migrate from villages and settle
down, and slums grow leading to unhygienic conditions affecting the health
of the people. We want to take up 300 such towns with a population upto
one lakh and we propose to spend Rs. 800 crore for their betterment on a
priority basis in the next five years. The scheme has been drawn up and I
have studied it yesterday. I found that it has been well prepared. Now we
are in a position to take up its implementation.
      Now I would like to take up 2-3 other important issues. We have
undertaken quietly a number of programmes for minorities. These
programmes have not been advertised but I would like to tell about them.
The Rapid Action Force (RAF) was raised for the protection of life and
property of the people. Last year I announced that five RAF battalions
would be raised. But we have doubled the strength by raising 10 battalions.
These have been located at places such as : Hyderabad, Ahmedabad,
Allahabad, Belgaum, Delhi, Aligarh, Thiruvananthapuram, Jamshedpur,
Bhopal and Meerut. In this Force, women are also included because
sometimes we need their help to control the situation. God forbid, we may
not need more of them because if people live in peace and harmony we do
not need such forces. But still we will be on our guard and if need arises we
will try to increase the number of these battalions. We will not hesitate to do
so. The members of this Force are trained in a special way, a lot of thinking
goes in their selection and they are always ready for every kind of duty.
Whenever there is a riot or disturbance, they immediately reach the scene
of occurrence and control the situation. They are specially trained for this
kind of job and I feel that because of them several riots can be controlled
and will be controlled before they do any serious damage. This Force will
continue to do its work and its capacity can be increased in the future.
      Many a time I have referred to the Minorities Commission. You know
that a law has been enacted in this regard. We are fully conscious of the
educational foundation in the name of Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, and as
you know there are several similar institutions which especially take care of
the education of the minorities. I would not go into details because they
have already been mentioned.
      Today, I want to draw your attention to another ambitious
programme. We wanted to set up a corporation which would help members
of the minorities in setting up their own enterprises and in getting proper
education. I had made an announcement about this last year. There were
some legal hurdles and I am very glad to announce that with a lot of efforts,
we have been able to remove them and now the “National Minorities
Finance and Development Corporation” will come into being with an
authorised capital of Rs. 500 crore. The Union Cabinet has already cleared
it and this would take shape in the coming few days. When this Corporation
starts working, I would like the lakhs of youth belonging to the minority
communities to take full advantage of this. This was a promise made by me
last year and I was a little worried about the delay in setting it up. I myself
went into all the details and strived to remove all the hurdles. I am glad that
we succeeded in our efforts.
      I shall give you another very good news. From today, you can watch
TV telecast in eleven languages. I recall that I had made an announcement
regarding telecast in five languages last year. Today, I am announcing that
programmes will be telecast in 11 languages and you need not keep eleven
antennas for this facility. Now while sitting in Delhi, you can watch
programmes of Calcutta, Madras, Hyderabad, Bombay etc. It is a big
achievement and I presume that in the next few months we will be able to
telecast the programmes in 13 languages, instead of 11 and you will be
able to watch the programmes of all the languages, wherever they are
being telecast, on your TV sets through a dish antenna. I am, really, very
happy to announce this.
      I had addressed our jawans on matters of defence and security last
evening. They will get all the encouragement and support from us. We shall
provide them any kind of arms they would require — most modern or
otherwise. They should not have any apprehension on this. Our soldiers
are doing their duty on borders and assisting the people in different parts of
the country. Not only this, they are working in some foreign countries also
and they have made India proud. They have made a place for themselves
in the hearts of the people of Cambodia, Somalia or wherever we have sent
them. I congratulate them once again and assure them that they will not
find us wanting in our efforts to fulfil their requirements. A good force is
always armed with the most modern weapons so that it goes to war without
any apprehension and with full confidence. While congratulating our forces,
I want to assure our forces that we have already tried to improve the terms
and conditions of their service and hope that the new Pay Commission will
go further into this matter. But I would like to add here that there is no way
we can measure and fully compensate the sentinels of our freedom as their
service is an act of patriotism. I would like to greet and congratulate them
once again.
      Now I will come to matters relating to our Foreign Policy Today, India
is maintaining friendly relations with all the countries of the world. I have
undertaken visits to several countries like the USA, Russia, China,
England, Germany, France, Iran, Korea Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Mauritius,
Indonesia, Oman and others. They have high regards for India. Bilateral
cooperation is increasing, cooperation in the economic field is increasing
very rapidly. In terms of foreign investment, which is another form of such
cooperation, the amounts we have received during the last three years is
almost twice the investment we had got during the previous ten years. I am
not saying this just for the sake of comparison but the facts speak. L am
sure this is going to take place on a larger scale in future. I am going to
Singapore, Vietnam and Malaysia. We have very cordial relations with all
the countries. I have also told you that we have cordial relations with all our
neighbours. I will once again ask our friends in Pakistan that they should
accept our hand of friendship, and not spurn it. After all we have to coexist,
we have to live as neighbours. We cannot move away from our neighbours.
Pakistan will remain where it is, and we will remain here where we are.
        There is a big hue and cry about our missiles and missile programme
and a lot of propaganda is going on. It is very strange that though Pakistan
has with it readymade bought off the shelf missiles, nobody talks about
them. We only want to experiment in our laboratories, and conduct some
tests and that causes a lot of hue and cry. What kind of justice is this, we
fail to understand. We have not increased our expenditure on defence.
India is not a small country. Do I have no right, is it not my duty to mobilise
resources for the defence requirements of a country so vast, with such vast
borders and coastlines? Let anybody say anything, I shall mobilise the
resources. Our first priority is the security of the country. There is no scope
for any compromise, any reduction in it. That is why, I want to tell my
friends that they should not compare India with other countries. They
should see the case of India according to its requirements, whether we
have spent the same amount as countries of our size are spending. We are
spending less than that. To compare our defence expenditure with a small
country and to say that we should not spend this much is not just. All that is
required to be done for our defence will be done. Let there be no doubt in
that regard.
       I want to tell you that the whole world is changing but there are some
places where things do not change. Some people cannot change their
mind-set. Today, I am ready to set aside politics and prepared to go
beyond mere political and diplomatic relations. At present, we are
expanding economic relations with all. Why shouldn't we expand these
economic relations within the SAARC? Why does Pakistan feel so bad
about it? Why is it so much hesitant? Let us cooperate in our SAARC
network of seven nations. But even this is not acceptable to them.
Wherever our Pakistani friends go, they raise the Kashmir issue. I have
stopped talking about Kashmir in any forum, nor do I give any reply to any
question on the issue. It is not necessary for us to tread the same path they
are walking upon. It is not necessary for us to reply to all the questions they
raise. The world knows what they have to say and what we have to reply.
People are aware of the conditions at the field level. Nothing is hidden from
anybody. Only they go on unnecessarily repeating them. I understand,
Pakistan is going to raise the Kashmir issue in a conference of the Health
Ministers. Now raising the issue in season and out of it will attract only the
derision of the world. We want to tell our friends that we share a blood
relationship. For God's sake, please for the sake of our relationship, do not
do this. We can solve these problems across the table. They talk of an
unfinished task. What is this unfinished task? In my well-considered
opinion, there is only one unfinished task from our point of view and that is
the restoration of Pak-occupied part of Kashmir to India. This is the only
unfinished task, nothing else remains.
      If this is not acceptable to you, the Simla Agreement is there. Let us
extend our hands of friendship to each other and move ahead shoulder to
shoulder. Please do not spurn these possibilities and stand in the way of a
bright future that looks ahead. But it is your sweet will if you are not
prepared to meet half way, we are firm on our own position. I want to tell
you that Kashmir is an integral part of India and will ever remain so. I am
not using the language of threat. Whatever I am saying, I am doing, is with
a cool head, and with a full sense of responsibility. If language is not to
change, let there be a change in intentions. Sometimes, one is obliged to
use such language. If one does not do so, people around get angry with
that person. I know this sort of compulsions exist at times. We do not have
any such constraint. It may, however exist for some people in some
countries. Still at least their intentions can be positive and peaceful. We
want peace but at the same time, we want to preserve our sovereignty.
There can be no compromise on these two issues.
      One thing more. Our freedom struggle had a very long run. It was so
because it was based on non-violence. It did not come to an end in a few
months, rather it continued for years and decades. During the course,
many great personalities took part in the struggle. Many of them did not live
to see freedom.
        But there were others who could see independent India, to which they
made great contribution during and after the freedom struggle. They are all
venerable souls for us. After independence, they had some differences
amongst them, and they parted company, they went to form many political
parties. But this does happen in a democracy. All the same, we bow to their
sense of patriotism, to the role they played in the freedom struggle. We
respect and revere them. On this issue, there is no question of party
affiliation or party politics. It is coincidence that this year we are also
celebrating the 125th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. We have
chalked out an ambitious programme. The programme is based on the path
shown by Gandhiji for the common good of the people. Besides, Acharya
Vinoba Bhave's birth centenary falls during the next month, that is
September. We also propose to celebrate it on a large scale. Acharya
Vinoba Bhave was among those who tried to bring about a revolution by
following the path shown by Gandhiji. We still remember him. If we had
even one hundredth part of the scholarship, originality of thought and the
will to act up to it that he was endowed with, it would have done
tremendous good to the country. We would naturally like to celebrate his
birth centenary. Then, the birth centenary of Rafi Ahmed Kidwai is being
celebrated. A Committee on this has been formed which has its own
programmes. We are going to act on those programmes in a befitting way
so that our youth may be made aware of such exemplary personalities.
       There is also a Memorial Committee for Lok Nayak Jayaprakash
Narayan. It is working for many years now but we want to give a new
content to its programmes and intensify them. He had, in his own way,
shown a path to the country. There is no doubt that there can be many
roads which lead to the same destination. He had also shown us a path, a
path of total revolution. I have studied it, so also thousands of youths of this
country and others. His was not an ordinary personality but a great one.
And we want to pay our tributes to him and give further impetus to his
programmes. Shri Morarji Desai will be one hundred years old in coming
February. Now he is 99. He is also a great patriot. He has sacrificed a lot
and later became the Prime Minister of the country. But let us not look into
the status he held. Let us look at the personality. One will rarely come
across such a unique personality. We would like to celebrate his centenary
next year. Like this, we would like to celebrate quite a few birth centenaries
because we had many great leaders in this country. There might be
differences of opinion among them in ideologies, in their approaches and
other spheres. But they all deserve our respect. We want to celebrate birth
centenaries of all these great persons so that people will understand these
great personalities, who were the driving force in achieving freedom and
who showed what sacrifices are required to strengthen and safeguard it.
People must know about them and learn from their lives.
       I have taken a lot of your time but I would like to tell you that quite a
few things have been left out. In 45 minutes or one hour, everything cannot
be covered. Whenever opportunity comes, I would present before you other
programmes. There are many programmes which call for a detailed
description but because of time constraint, I am not able to touch upon
them. I would, however, like to tell you that the country is marching ahead
on the road to progress. There is no doubt about it. We should be guided
by a new inspiration and a spirit of dedication. Our commitment should not
be to any individual but to the future of the country and we are committed to
it. As I see this spirit among millions of our countrymen, I am convinced that
our country will be safe in the hands of the coming generations, in the
hands of future leadership. Our job is to keep it intact and pass it on to the
future leadership in a sound condition. This I would consider as my sincere
and humble duty. I want to assure you that no effort will be spared by me to
achieve this. Whatever difficulty I may have to face, I shall strive to
accomplish this task."
1993,P.V. Narasimha Rao,INC,Unity and Stability for Sustained Growth,"Free rendering of Independence Day speech in Hindi from the ramparts of the Red Fort, New Delhi, 15 August 1993","P.V. Narasimha Rao, selected speeches, Vol 3",NA,"I greet you all on the occasion of the 46th anniversary of our
Independence Day and, on this auspicious occasion, I congratulate you
and extend to you my hearty felicitations.
       As you know, we celebrated the Golden Jubilee of the Quit India
Movement, a few days ago. This Movement was the most decisive part of
our struggle for independence and within five years of this Movement we
achieved our independence. Many freedom fighters who made great
sacrifices for the freedom, are fortunately with us and many of them are no
more. We are grateful to all of them. The nation will never forget them and
their names will be there in the history of India for ever.
      Today, on 15th August, we are making a new beginning in the
technological field. Till now, Doordarshan had only two channels. But from
today, you will have six channels on Doordarshan. This is no small
achievement. At the most one or two channels could have been added but
our scientists have performed a miracle in space. The INSAT-2B satellite
designed and fabricated by our scientists has been stationed in the
geocentric orbit and it is working quite perfectly. Consequently, from today
you have got six channels and gradually you will have more channels on
the Doordarshan. This satellite is one of the examples of our self-reliance in
the realm of science and technology.
      Here I would also like to tell you something that relates to our national
resolve. We needed an engine called cryogenic engine for the satellite.
There is no difficulty in buying the engine but some difficulty is there in the
transfer of technology. There are many reasons behind it but there is no
need to go into them now. We were to get this technology from Russia but
now there is a question mark on it. Then, what do we do? Should we give
up our programme? Definitely not. We have decided and our scientists
have assured us that within two years they will develop the same
technology indigenously and after that there would be no difficulty in
designing, manufacturing and launching such satellites. The scientists have
asked for two years time and till then we can purchase these engines and
our satellite programme would continue without any hindrance.
       This day is very memorable for us. On this day we take stock of
situation, dwell on our past and think of future. Let us look at the
achievements of the Government and people of India during the last two
years. I would like to tell you briefly. It is not that you do not know about
them but still I would like to recall them. First let us have a look at our
economy. You have to make a comparison of the present state of economy
with the one which this Government inherited from the previous
Governments. The extent of progress we have made in two years is a
miracle in itself. This proves that our economic system was good, the
infrastructure was basically sound, but because it was distorted for one or
two years, it went haywire. After this, we started mending it and it
recovered quickly. Therefore, there is no need to be pessimistic. The
foundation of this economic system, laid by our leaders during the last forty
years, is still very strong and it could steadily move forward only if the
system is allowed to grow without any obstruction or attempt at distorting it.
      You must have been reading about the inflation, which has today
come down to 5 percent from 17 percent within less than two years. What
does it mean? It means that fluctuations in prices as prevailed in some
other countries do not exist in our country and it shall never be so. Prices
have been controlled in a manner that whatever fluctuations there may be,
it would always be within our control. You must have noticed that increase
or decrease in prices in a year have remained confined within a small
range and have never gone beyond it. This is an indication of the strength
of our economy.
      Today, you have to take one more thing into consideration. It is the
amount of money that we received as deposits from outside. You may ask
what was the need for it. This is required because we need foreign
exchange. We have to import kerosene, fertilizers, machinery and we need
foreign exchange to bring all these from abroad.
     When this Government came to power, we had only about 2000 to
2400 crore rupees in foreign exchange reserve. It was going to be
exhausted within a week. I am happy to state that today, we have Rs.
21000 crore, i.e., 7 billion dollars. Today, if you have to import from
anywhere, you would have no problem. Our foreign exchange position is
very good. It is in such conditions that we are able to march forward with
self-confidence and we are forging ahead.
      The growth of the economy is also satisfactory. And the trade
balance, i.e. how much we export and how much we import is very
important. If you import too much from outside, your foreign exchange
reserves would deplete and get exhausted, but when you export more and
import less, there will be a favourable balance between the two. I am very
happy to say that for the first time in the history of free India, we have
achieved the trade balance. Earlier we used to import more and export
less. Now, both of these have come to an equal level and, for the first time,
we have a very comfortable position. So we will not be required to touch
the foreign exchange reserves that we have. The money we get from our
exports shall be used for imports and this will keep up the trade balance,
      Whatever programmes we have taken up, are mostly for the poor.
Today, a comment, an irresponsible comment, is made that all the
programmes formulated by this Government are for the rich. Nothing can
be farther from the truth. In fact, all our programmes are for the poor. We
have made enormous increase in the Jawahar Rozgar Yojana and rural
development. If we look at this year's budget, the increase in allocations for
the programmes for rural development, education and health and many
other schemes which directly benefit the poor and the rural population, no
one can say that these programmes are for the affluent section of the
society only.
      Of course, I must say, for industrialisation we don't have adequate
resources. Ours is a poor country and the preceding Governments made it
poorer. Today, what we need is capital investment. If this is not done, our
industry will not grow. If the industry does not grow, there would be
unemployment, and in the absence of employment, there would be
starvation, unrest and the country would disintegrate. Hence, the most
important thing is to improve our economy. For this we need to launch a
gigantic program of industrialisation and we have done so.
      I am happy to say that last year our industrialisation programme
progressed smoothly for about eight months, but after 6 December, and the
bomb blasts in Bombay, it received a setback and slowed down. This
happens. If law and order or peace in the country is threatened, why should
the people from outside come here, even if they are our own people, and
invest their money? It became apparent that after the good record of eight
months, their enthusiasm got dampened. But, on the whole, our
industrialisation programme is progressing well. Today, the country has
about 10,000 proposals for setting up small and big projects and they are
about to be set up.
      While marching towards industrialisation, we have taken steps to
ensure that our workers do not suffer in any way. We have created a
separate fund for them with an amount of about 2,000 crore rupees. The
workers shall be helped with this money. They won't be allowed to remain
without job. The money will be provided to them from this fund for training
to redeploy them in any other job and care will be taken about their future.
       Now, I come to agriculture. It is a matter of great pride for us that this
year's agricultural production has crossed all records of the past 40 years.
We have increased our production to this level and I, on behalf of the
people, the country, and on behalf of the Government of India, would like to
congratulate and felicitate the farmers of the country. Of course, farmer is
the ""Annadata"" but today he is also our exporter. For the first time, we are
exporting our agricultural produce and this export can be on very large
scale and we want to extend all support to this venture. The New
Agricultural Policy lays great emphasis on the export of agricultural
products. It will require more investments and more capital. We want to
invest more on irrigation because the more we invest, the higher will be the
yield. India is among the very few nations of the world which can produce
enough not only for feeding its own people but also for export. We have to
maintain this tempo. We have to give maximum benefit to our farmers.
      In the last two years, you have noticed, the support prices that we
give to the farmers have been going up. For instance, the support price of
wheat has been enhanced by Rs. 55 per quintal and gram by Rs. 100. We
have also raised the support price of different varieties of paddy between
Rs. 40 and Rs. 60 per quintal.
       Have you or any farmer ever heard of an increase of such a
magnitude in the support price? There was a time when it was difficult to
give an increase of one or two rupees in the support price. At present, we
are giving these higher support prices because the expenditure of farmer
has also increased. It is not a charity nor any obligation. Rather, the farmer
is obliging us. We are only cooperating with and supporting him. Therefore,
we should fix a reasonable price and should not hesitate to pay that. If we
were to import foodgrains, we would have realised our burden and our
consequent expenditure. The farmer is saving a lot of foreign exchange for
us. Once again, I would like to congratulate the farmer.
       Another programme in the field of agriculture is that of crop
insurance. This programme existed earlier also, but had some lacunae in it.
It was thought to prepare a pilot scheme to be implemented next year. It
would cover the farmers and include all the crops. First we would
implement the scheme on pilot basis in one district of each State. When
this programme is extended to the whole country, the farmer would have no
worry about the fate of his crops in the event of excessive rains, hailstorms,
and drought. If the crop insurance programme runs well, the farmer would
not have to worry about these natural calamities.
        It is well known that we have helped the farmers a lot in so far as
fertilizers are concerned. We are giving them assistance of Rs. 1,000 per
tonne. DAP and other fertilizers were available at cheaper rates in foreign
countries as compared to the rates of indigenous fertilizers. We, therefore,
moved swiftly to import them. The difference in prices of indigenously
produced and the imported fertilizers ranged between Rs. 2,000 to Rs.
2,500 per tonne. We have imported fertilizers for the whole year. Today, I
would like to assure the farmers that they will have no worry about the
continuous availability of fertilizer for a year. Whatever they want, and in
whatever quantity, is available in our country. There are some factories
which have become unviable, the costs of their production have started
increasing. So we have given them many more facilities and made them
viable. At present, they are also engaged in the production.
      Now I would like to tell you a few things about the rural development.
You have heard about the outlay of Rs. 30,000 crore on rural development
and this money is being used for the schemes which benefit the rural
people directly.
      You may recall that last year I had announced a programme for
artisans. There are lots of craftsmen and artisans in our villages but their
tools are very old. These may be as old as 100 to 200 years. They work
with these obsolete tools; hence their productivity is restricted. We had
declared that modern tools would be provided to all the rural craftsmen of
the country and we would take up a massive programme for providing
them. I am happy to say that we had taken up 62 districts last year and 100
more districts this year and by the end of current Five Year Plan, we would
be implementing this programme throughout the country.
        The programme has proved beneficial. More than 1 to 1.5 lakh
artisans have benefitted from this scheme and their productivity enhanced,
so much so, some of the people who had left their hearth and home for the
cities ultimately returned to the villages, for now they can earn the same
amount of money sitting in their homes in the village itself. So why should
they go to the cities? This is happening silently without any pomp or show.
In villages, the artisan is being convinced that new tool kits are beneficial to
him and artisans are profiting from this. This programme is not to be left
half-way. The programme will go on during the entire Plan period until each
one of our artisans starts working with improved tools. In a way, this will
bring about a revolution in the lives of artisans.
     You are aware that a massive programme for the supply of drinking
water has been taken up. Almost all the villages known as revenue villages
have been covered. But every village also has small hamlets. Now these
hamlets have to be covered because even if there are three-four hamlets or
even 10 families, they also need water and their requirement is to be met.
One cannot say that since there are only a few people over there, they
would not require water. Everybody needs water. So to provide drinking
water to all, a massive programme is going on under the Rural
Development Department.
       Now, the Panchayati Raj. After four years of intensive efforts,
overcoming obstacles, we have recently passed the Panchayati Raj Bill in
Parliament and State governments have also passed it in their Assemblies.
It has now become an Act. Within a year the country shall have a new
structure of Panchayati Raj wherein the people's power will find expression.
The power which was vested in them but suppressed, will emerge and you
will see that the Panchayat will take up impressive programmes of
development. India shall witness a new enthusiasm and massive
programme of development.
      I would like to tell my sisters, that when the new Panchayat is
constituted, it will have thirty per cent women members in it. You should be
prepared for shouldering such a heavy responsibility. Till now there used to
be few women in the Panchayat and they could not participate actively but
now the women will have to participate more actively in the Panchayats.
They will have to take over the work assigned to them. The reservation for
Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes already exists and will be
maintained in proportion to their population.
      Last year, I had announced that we would form a Commission for the
Safai Karmacharis. I am happy to announce that we have decided to form
not just a Commission, but a statutory Commission. The Bill to this effect is
already before Parliament for consideration. In the next few days it will be
passed by Parliament. Safai Karmacharis belong to the backward
community. Their uplift is a must and we would not spare any effort to do it.
      We are determined to eliminate the practice of carrying human
excreta on head which is still in vogue in some of our cities and small
towns. To eliminate the practice, we have made a provision of Rs. 111
crore this year. We would make every effort to provide Safai Karmacharis
with alternative employment. Once a Commission is formed, it will look into
their problems and evolve measures to solve them. I want to assure our
brethren that the Commission's recommendations will receive full attention
from the Government.
       You might be aware of the constitution of the National Backward
Class Financial Development Corporation. The Corporation has done a
good job. It has given loans to 25,000 people and has arranged for their
livelihood within a short span of one year. In the same way thousands more
will benefit from this Corporation.
        I also want to tell our weavers that for the first time, a change in their
life is awaiting them. So far, they were never included in the schemes for
the rural development. For the first time now, the weavers have been
included in these schemes currently being implemented in the rural areas.
They will be given looms, working sheds and working capital and for this a
sum of Rs. 525 crore has been earmarked.
       Now with this new programme, the weavers have a new hope for a
better life. I want to congratulate them on this occasion and would like to
tell them to take full advantage of these facilities.
       In the meanwhile, there was drought in many States and floods in
some others. In fact, the situation was such that in the same State, in one
part there was drought, while in the other part, there were floods. I visited
some of these States. We gave them timely help to provide relief to the
affected people to the extent possible.
      Floods are a recurring phenomenon. They visit us every year. Relief
is provided. After the floods recede, all is forgotten till the next flood. This is
not proper. We have to think of some permanent solution to control the
floods. We will take all aspects into consideration. This task cannot be
completed in a short time. It may take years. But we have to make a
beginning somewhere. I assure you that we would initiate action on this,
whether it is in Bihar or Uttar Pradesh or any other State. Otherwise the
curse of floods will always haunt our country.
      Brothers, now I want to tell you about some new schemes and make
some announcements. In the last few days, we have taken stock of several
schemes which are continuing in the country, but we will also have to
introduce some new schemes and implement them.
       The first scheme relates to our sisters, especially those living in the
rural areas. The present plight of the women is well known to everybody.
This situation needs improvement. Some of us are of the view that if the
women are self-reliant in financial matters, they will be able to hold their
heads high. A woman should get a status in the society. Her role should not
be confined to routine household work but she should be made an
important constituent of the society, which is called empowerment. And
today, we have to take up the programme of empowering the women. It is a
very important thing but it looks as though it would take a lot of time. Every
adult woman of the country should have an account of her own in a bank or
in a post office wherever possible so that she can get the status of an
account holder.
      She should have the freedom of operating her account independently
as others do. And she should be able to deposit or withdraw the money
from that account, whether it is an amount of Rs. 100, Rs. 50 or even Rs.
30. Therefore, we have taken up this scheme which involves a Government
expenditure of Rs. 1,000 crore. A woman who opens a savings account
and deposits Rs. 300 within a year, the Government will give her Rs. 75
and she will be getting Rs. 375 after a year. All this money will be hers. We
do not want to take anything from her, rather, we want to give Rs. 75 from
our side. The Government will be incurring a loss on this scheme, but I am
sure the kind of self-confidence that it will generate in women is priceless.
Nobody can assess the value of that self-confidence. Now that they are
poised to shoulder the bigger responsibilities in Panchayat system, they
should know at least what is an account. Today, how many women are
there in the rural society who have their own independent account? There
must be very few, I guess. Tomorrow when crores of such accounts are
opened, it would usher in a new revolution in the world of women. I want to
reiterate my determination to implement this programme.
       There are several voluntary organisations. Mahila Mandals as in the
villages. I want to appeal to them to help our women to run this programme
which the Government has decided to implement by incurring a large
expenditure. These organisations need to provide their help only for one
year. Thereafter our womenfolk will them learn about this and will not seek
their help. We must take up programme because it generates a new
attitude.
      An employment programme is currently going on in Maharashtra,
Karnataka etc. Our entire scheme is also employment oriented and we
have to see how maximum number of people could be given employment.
In the rural areas, people get employment during the agricultural season
but during the course of the year there are at least 100 days, which are
called lean days when there is not much agricultural activity. People remain
idle. We have decided to provide them employment during these 100 days.
Though it may not be guaranteed, but I assure them that those who are
ready to work will get work as is being done in Karnataka and Maharashtra
at present. We want to adopt this scheme throughout the country. Though
the Jawahar Rozgar Yojana and other schemes are already there, the main
purpose of this scheme is to provide assured employment to those who are
unemployed. As I have announced last year, we want to implement this
programme in all 1,700 backward blocks in the country where the poorest
of the poor live and which are situated in the hilly, desert or the tribal areas.
The work will start in those blocks because maximum number of
unemployed persons are there and people do not even get a square meal a
day. Later it will be extended to cover the entire country.
      The third programme is for our semi-educated youth who do not get
employment. Educated unemployed such as matriculates or undermatrics,
do not get work because perhaps their qualification is inadequate, or
because there is no ready employment. For them, we have envisaged a
scheme under which they can start their own small enterprises. Thousands
of occupations, such as opening of shops, require only a little training for
our youth. They do not require any high qualifications. We want to give
employment to such people. If two people start any joint enterprise, the
Government would provide them Rs. one lakh as loan. Of this amount of
Rs. one lakh, Rs. 7,500 will be subsidy. We will provide training and other
                                   ​ e think that within the remaining three
facilities to run the ​enterprise. W
years of the present Five Year Plan, we can provide such jobs to 10 lakh
youths of the country. We have made financial provision for this scheme.
We are announcing these three new schemes today because, we think that
these programmes can be completed during the remaining three years.
       Now, I will turn to political scenario. As far as Punjab is concerned, I
have already said and you also know that there is now complete peace. If
someone asks which is the most peaceful State in the country today, the
answer will be Punjab. This is the same Punjab which had been bleeding
for the last 12 years. This is a matter of pride for the people and the
Government of Punjab, who have made it all
Possible.
      It is also a matter of pride for the men of our armed forces and police
who grappled with the terrorists and controlled them. On behalf of the
nation, I extend the heartiest felicitation to them all. Punjab is our granary. If
there is any disturbance there, it will affect the entire country. But kudos to
the people of Punjab who made this miracle possible and maintained the
agricultural production and did not allow it to slide down from its number
one position when the State was bleeding. This is a matter of great pride. I
want to congratulate them again. Now Punjab is poised for an industrial
revolution. All ground work has been done. You will see that in the next
two-three years, there will be an industrial revolution along with the Green
Revolution.
      The situation in Kashmir has not improved as yet. There is only a
marginal improvement but we still have to do a lot. In Kashmir, the
incitement, money and weapons and trained people come from Pakistan.
The trouble is not from within Kashmir but it comes from across the border.
People of Kashmir are against terrorism. This, I can state with full
confidence. But when they face bullets, they are naturally scared. Though
people do not say it, but if terrorism comes to an end, they will be very
happy and heave a sigh of relief. There is no doubt about it. While Pakistan
is carrying out false propaganda about human rights violation in J. & K. only
two days ago the terrorists from that country stopped a bus midway and
pulled out 16 or 17 people and shot them dead. Do they mean that those
who have been the victims of their bullets have no human rights? Have
they no right to live? Only when the terrorists get killed in encounters, why
do these people get perturbed, why do they campaign for upholding the
human rights? Do only the terrorists have human rights? They have a right
to kill others and they also have human rights to the effect that nobody
should kill them. This is a warped logic beyond comprehension and we are
not prepared to accept it. I would like to congratulate those who fought
against terrorism and caught many terrorists and have tried to bring the
situation somewhat under control. This process will continue. Pakistan may
do whatever it wants, but Kashmir is an inalienable part of India. Nobody
can separate it from India, whatever means they may use. Recently,
Pakistan had reached where it would have been declared a terrorist state.
Now when they provide weapons and other material for promoting
terrorism, whom they are harming? I would like to appeal to them and also
warn them that this plan will benefit no one of them in any case. India will
remain unmoved from its position that Kashmir will remain an integral part
of India and we will always serve the people of Kashmir in every possible
manner and solve their problems. Nothing can be achieved from this
bloodshed.
      Issues have come up about Assam, Bodoland and recently
Jharkhand. Certain problems are considered by locals as a matter of life
and death because when a movement is carried on for a long time without
any result, one feels bad. One becomes irritated and loses self-control.
Assam problem has been solved. Bodoland problem has been solved and
the matter relating to Jharkhand will also be resolved shortly. We should,
therefore, not get impatient. There is no need to get excited and lose one's
temper. This is a message, I have for them.
      In so far as Ayodhya is concerned, I was hesitant to comment on the
issue. But it is necessary to say that there has been such destruction that
has tarnished India's image. Abroad. India's image looks sullied. We
appear to be destructive. We have been known as a peace loving nation for
the past 5000 years. Now the opinion all over the world about us has
undergone a change and people are wondering how we have given in to
violence. We are not covered with more glory. On the contrary, we have
been defamed. People have started doubting our cultural traditions and our
peace loving nature. I would say that no condemnation of this
disrespectable act will be adequate. But the irony is that this act is being
projected as praiseworthy. If somebody goes abroad to project the
demolition as a good act, this further spoils our image.
       I want to emphasise that it is not a good move. Within a short span of
time, it would be clear as to who was responsible for this. It will also be
known as to how it was done, who did it and who were behind it.
       Today, I want to tell you that only one motive is working behind these
things. It has become a habit to misuse religion for political purposes.
Politics is a good thing, so is religion. Without religion, there is no direction,
one becomes confused. Religion, whichever it may be, is meant for guiding
our lives to the right path. Politics shows the way for the organisation of
society and the organisation of the state. Religion and politics both have
their rightful places in their appointed spheres. But when both are mixed
and religion is used for political purposes, religion does not remain religion,
it takes the shape of communalism. We have to stand unitedly and fight
against communalism. It includes the government and the people. No
sacrifice is too big for it. For the past few years, communalism is raising its
head and if this situation is allowed to continue, there will be no future for
our country and the nation will fall apart. Once it is accepted that one
religion is superior and another is inferior, one is good and the other is bad,
then there will be no unity in this country, no integrity. The nation will
disintegrate. It is not mentioned in any religion to hate or to look down upon
other religions. All are equal. Whether it is a majority or a minority in our
country, all are equal under our Constitution. Whatever the number, even
the miniscule has the same rights that are enjoyed by the majority. That is
why we have to assert that any such discrimination will not work in this
country, and shall not be tolerated. You have also to assert that whosoever
violates the Constitution, cannot do it for all time to come. One may do it for
one or two days, in one election or two elections, but soon people will
understand and will teach such violaters a lesson. I want to impress that we
have to get rid of these things. Religion should be kept separate from
politics. We have to give importance to both. Follow your religion, nobody
has any objection. Go and work for your respective parties, give details of
your programmes to the people, get votes and rule. Nobody has any
objection. But, no one has a right to ask for votes in the name of Hindu or
Islam or Christianity. No one has a right to exploit the sentiments of the
people, by creating a frenzy fundamentalism. This should never be allowed
to happen, this is my appeal to you.
     Secularism is our life breath. The moment it stops, our breath will
cease, nation's breath will cease. The Government is making efforts to
preserve our secular character. A Bill has been brought before Parliament
which prohibits the use of religion in politics. However, law alone is not
enough.
      There is a need for spreading awareness among the masses about
the dangers of using religion in politics. Each and everyone should be
made aware of this. I want to stress that whatever we are doing should be
supplemented by you. All of us have to work together for its success.
       I was speaking of destruction. How do we react to destruction?
Destruction cannot be countered with destruction. If somebody brings down
a structure, the response cannot be the destruction of something else.
Whatever has been demolished, will have to be built, rebuilt. No one knows
how many cities had been destroyed during the last World War. Hundreds
of cities were razed to the ground. London was afire and half of it was
destroyed. But nobody despaired. Each and every building destroyed was
reconstructed after the Great War; so also destroyed cities were
reconstructed; half of London which was destroyed was rebuilt; in a better
manner than the earlier ones. Today, we should not kneel down before
these destructive forces and particularly, the destruction in Ayodhya. We
will not accept defeat and will respond to the destruction by reconstruction.
I not only assure you of this but also call upon all of you to come forward. If
we work unitedly, the recent past of Ayodhya, which has left a scar in the
hearts of the people will disappear. Only then will we be able to make
secularism a success in this country.
      As regards foreign affairs, you are aware that India has been very
active during the past two years. We are hosting in our country a meeting
of G-15, a forum of developing countries. There are a number of
programmes that developing countries have to undertake. In the
competition between North and South, India has always been playing an
excellent role on behalf of developing countries.
      I hope India will succeed in her efforts and developing countries will
continue to march forward and achieve prosperity. Their programmes for
development will be successfully implemented.
       New complaints, disputes and controversies are developing today in
the sphere of environment. They need to be solved. Not through
confrontation but through discussions and dialogues, because through
confrontation we would not succeed. Gone are the days when there were
two power blocs. They used to quarrel some times directly: at other times
by provoking groups having allegiance to them and instigating the latter to
indulge in small skirmishes. Now the situation has changed. In the new
situation we have to move forward through our reasoning and strong will. If
you have a strong will, you will succeed.
      Our relations with the neighbouring countries, except Pakistan, are
good. We can have good relations with Pakistan too. I have met the
Pakistan Prime Minister about half a dozen times. Our personal relations
are very cordial but when it comes to matters of policy, it is difficult to say
anything. Elections are going to be held shortly in Pakistan and a new
leadership will take over. I hope the new leadership will come with greater
sense of realism and will have the courage to accept the reality and then
alone could there be further and meaningful dialogue between us.
       There need be no doubt on this. We are ready for talks, but one thing
is clear, Kashmir is an indivisible part of India. It has been and wiIl remain
so. If this reality is accepted, there will be friendship and cooperation. I
want to give this assurance. I want to give the same assurance to Pakistan,
our neighbour and that it should forget about making efforts to separate
Kashmir from India. That efforts have been made time and again and
campaigning and spending have been going on. But now Pakistan must
forget this. We can remain good friends forever on this basis and our
friendship will serve as a model to the world.
      Friends, I have taken much of your time. Today, whatever we are
doing, we are doing for millions of our poor brothers and sisters. There are
elements who are attempting to disturb our economic reforms by saying
that money is being brought from outside, why it is being brought and on
what will it be spent?
      Whatever may be the source of money, it will be used to set up
industry in India. The investor will not take away the industry to his country.
He will construct railways, roads. I have already stated whatever
infrastructure is created, it will remain with us. Now, the foreign investor
may remain for whatever time in the country. Later he may like to go away.
Structures raised by him will belong to the country. At the most, we have to
pay him. They are welcome to join hands with us in the development of
India as they are doing in other countries. They are welcome and millions
of our people will be benefited and we are determined to achieve this. I am
not satisfied with 30,000 crore rupees. Had it been 50,000 crores or more, I
would have been happier. Had it been one lakh crore rupees it would have
made me still happier. But we don't have that sort of money. We will do
whatever we can.
      So many civilizations have spread from India. India has been the
birthplace of many civilizations. Today, we have to save ourselves from the
doubts in the minds of people regarding our civilization, our culture and our
peace-loving nature. Otherwise, our glory, our image and our structure will
be adversely affected and it will be very difficult to regain them. One more
thing I want to say. If our attention is diverted from our economic
programmes even for a month, then it would lead to severe economic loss.
One should appreciate this. There were bomb blasts in Bombay. Our
Finance Ministry says that on conservative estimates within a span of one
or two months, we suffered a loss of about ten thousand crore rupees. In
two months, if we suffer a loss of ten thousand crore rupees just because
some mad person throws a bomb, what does it mean? In such a big
country, will we allow me or three bombs to put the economy in disarray?
How will we work? We will just not permit this to happen.
       We do not tolerate any bomb blast. Wherever it occurs, I assure you,
it would be dealt with. Preventive measures will be taken and those
involved will be punished. But if such an incident does occur once in a
while, why should it divert our attention from the path of economic
progress? We want to move towards one direction only and it is the
direction of economic progress. We are already lagging behind. Many
smaller countries have gone much ahead of us. In case, for another two or
three years, we get bogged down with Hindu Muslim riots, caste disputes
and political and religious conflicts, and do not pay single-minded attention
to economic progress, then our future will be bleak. This is the warning, we
are receiving from all over the world. Our wisdom is also sounding a note of
warning. Whether we listen to the voice of sanity or not, it is up to us. I
would say, we must listen to it. I will give you an example from an
Upanishad. There is a dancer. She is dancing while the musical
instruments are being played and songs are being sung. She has a pitcher
on her head. She would not allow the pitcher to fall, dance she must, her
whole body would sway, but the pitcher would remain on her head.
Maulistha Kumbha Parirakshana Dhiranativa. This is what our attitude
should be. Let there be any calamity: let us be involved in any other
activity; but the pitcher of development placed on our head, the pitcher of
advancement, the pitcher of economic programmes that pitcher should
never be allowed to topple down. This caution is a must for us. If we are
cautious enough to keep moving forward, there will be no problem for us.
       In the comity of nations, India has taken her appropriate place and we
will continue to strive to improve our position. Many opportunities are
awaiting us. Soon the Security Council will be expanded. The UN has a
number of programmes in which we have to play a greater role. We have
always been active there. Wherever there has been a dispute, people start
looking towards India, for we are not in favour of aggravating differences.
We are among those who are for peace. We ourselves are peace-loving
people. Hence, we have an important place there. But a country which is
not internally strong cannot be considered strong abroad. Therefore, I
would like to say with due respect to you that whether we belong to the
minority or majority or any other faith or are even atheist, it does not matter.
This is a matter of individual faith. I have already stated that there would
not be any discrimination in so far as minorities are concerned. They are in
minority only in numbers, but from the point of view of citizenship they are
equal. Everybody would enjoy the same rights. This is what I want to say.
Today minorities feel insecure with regard to their life and property. Recent
riots have increased this sense of insecurity; they are scared. In this
context I would mention to you that the police force is there to keep law and
order. In this force we have introduced battalions of Rapid Action Force.
Already five battalions have been formed and another five are under
training. We wish to increase the number of these battalions since this
mixed force can be deployed wherever or whenever riots occur and will
successfully restore law and order. The members of the Rapid Action Force
will undergo a little more intensive training than an ordinary policeman. This
training will be very comprehensive. It will be a complete action. The idea of
Rapid Action Force was conceived during the time of Smt Indira Gandhi
and also considered during the period of Rajivji. But I feel proud that I got
the opportunity to implement the idea and we are pursuing these ideas and
schemes relentlessly.
      We have founded a National Minority Finance and Development
Corporation with an authorised capital of Rs. 500 crore only a day or two
ago. When we decided to have this Corporation, we were considering
whether it would be correct from the legal point of view. Then we came to
the conclusion that the setting up of this Corporation is perfectly in order.
There is nothing wrong in it. People will see that on one hand we will do
everything possible to protect the life and property of the minorities and on
the other, we will also do whatever is essential for the economic uplift of
minorities. Of course, the Minority Commission has already been vested
with statutory powers. Its recommendations will be accepted to the extent
possible.
      Maulana Azad Education Foundation will be utilised as a medium for
further educating the people belonging to minorities. We will give the
Foundation more fund, more help. We will make the Foundation an
instrument to serve more and more people in the field of education.
      In the context of Waqf Act, either a new law will be enacted or a
number of amendments will be made in the existing law. This will help
prevent irregularities regarding Waqf properties. There are a number of
programmes, for instance, there is the 15-point programme. There are
other programmes too, but as we are short of time, we cannot go into
details. However I want to emphasise once again that whether it be the
minority or majority, they have to live together. Nobody will go from this
place. We will stay here together. This is our determination.
       Therefore, the signal that we would like to send to the world today is:
We will not allow our unity and integrity to suffer and will not allow our
achievements to fritter away. This is a new responsibility which we have to
shoulder. We pray to the Lord Almighty to give us strength so that we may
go forward and proceed towards our goal. From Mahatma Gandhi to Rajivji
all the leaders have shown the way to our countrymen. Proceeding on that
path, we have to tell the world that our steps would never falter. We will
continue to move forward on the path shown by them and we shall redeem
ourselves along with the country and will be able to redeem the human
race as well.
      In this great task of redeeming the human race, we will fulfil our
responsibility. With this determination and resolve we assemble here
together once again on this fifteenth of August. All the countrymen,
wherеvеr уоu аrе, who are listening to me in every nook and corner, I wish
to congratulate and thank all of you once again. I wish you happiness and
prosperity in the coming year."
1992,P.V. Narasimha Rao,INC,Towards Hopeful Future,"Free rendering of Independence Day speech in Hindi from the ramparts of the Red Fort, 15 August 1992","P.V. Narasimha Rao, selected speeches, Vol 2",NA,"I open my hearty greetings to you on this auspicious occasion of the
forty-fifth anniversary of independence. This year has got a special
significance because we are celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of ""Quit
India Movement.” We salute the people whose great sacrifices won
independence for the country. We want to draw inspiration from them and
wherever they are, whether in the country or abroad, I beseech their
blessings on this occasion. We have undertaken a gigantic task which is
really stupendous and our journey is very long but I am confident that with
inspiration from them, our task would become easier.
       Friends, I had spoken to you from here a year ago. I had then
presented before you a brief outline of conditions prevailing, and the
economic situation that we had inherited. A year has gone by in facing
these challenges and I am happy to say that in our endeavour during the
year we have achieved considerable success. I think that the conditions
that you see today are vastly different from what they were last year. Today
you can see a picture of stability in the country. There is no doubt that last
year there were question marks about the stability but today no one inside
or outside the country thinks that there is any instability. This picture of
stability has been very helpful in carrying forward the programme of
economic reforms and in maintaining social harmony that I had referred to
last year. However, a lot remains to be done. You are aware that during
last one year the country has not witnessed any upheaval that could have
damaged or unsettled our social structure. Some small disturbances have
erupted occasionally here and there and they were brought under control
and today the overall situation is by and large peaceful. The stream of life is
flowing peacefully and there are no storms. This is highly gratifying
because this is the kind of environment that we need to move ahead on the
path of progress.
      Last year on behalf of the Government, I had adopted a new method
of functioning through consensus. Now also I feel that this is the correct
method for the country because the national problems are not problems of
any particular party. They are problems which need to be placed above
party politics and these problems have their bearing upon the entire nation
and, therefore, they have to be tackled accordingly. They can be resolved
only by taking all the parties, sections and communities into confidence. I
want to reiterate that we shall continue to adhere to it.
       As far as the economy is concerned, we have achieved substantial
success in this direction. You know the difficulties that we were facing last
year so much so that we had to pledge our gold. The gold has since been
brought back. Our foreign exchange reserves were not more than Rs.
1,000 crores and perhaps, within a week we would have defaulted and our
credibility would have been ruined. We had to start from such a difficult
situation. Very carefully and cautiously we took certain steps and today I
am happy to say that our foreign exchange reserves have touched the
peak of Rs. 17.000 crores and we have no difficulty in importing anything
that we may require.
      On the other hand, as a result of the measures taken during the year,
our exports are showing signs of growth. On this front there were a few
doubts but during the last month and a half I find that our exports have
started rising. This means that our industries are operating, production is
increasing and we are again in a position to increase our exports.
       We have also succeeded in attracting foreign investment for
industrialisation within the country. We have received proposals of the
order of Rs. 3,000 crores. This investment may take a little time to actually
materialise but this is a significant amount not only in terms of money but
also from the point of view of technology. Along with this there are bright
possibilities of greater investment of capital by our industrialists in the
country.
      The proposals that we have received indicate that there will be
investment of about 35-40 thousand crore rupees from within the country
which will give a big boost to our industrialisation.
      Only a month and a half back, it was apprehended that rainfall may
be subnormal and could create some difficulties. But now I understand that
the country has had good rains and as a result, the crops are likely to be
good. And, therefore, we can hope that there will be general prosperity in
the country and we would not have to face difficulties like drought.
      Now, I want to present before you a few things relating to our policies
and I think they should be clearly understood. First of all, I would like to tell
you that we are engaged in a massive programme of country-wide
economic reforms in the shape of Eighth Five Year Plan which envisages
an outlay of about 4.5 lakh crore rupees. When we are engaged in such a
large venture, it is absolutely essential that we should concentrate on that
and our attention should not be distracted. It is possible that there may be
some disturbances to divert our attention. Some of them may be on
account of the circumstances but others will be due to a deliberate design.
But, we have to overcome routine problems and concentrate our energies
on development and progress and the Government is determined to do so.
       Second point that I would like to present before you is that the
Government is a powerful institution, but the question is for what end this
power should be used. It is our belief and commitment that this powerful
institution should be used for the protection of people who are powerless,
who are weak and vulnerable and who are unable to protect themselves.
Powerful people in the society can take care of themselves, but the
Government must prominently help those who are not in a position to help
themselves. But, when we want the Government to be the protector of the
weak, we face certain problems in functioning, we must understand them.
        For the last 40 years, we have been implementing Five Year Plans.
Still, in whichever village we visit, we see development lacking there.
School buildings or roads may be in a state of disrepair and there are many
things about which people have their general complaints. These complaints
are valid.
       On the other hand there are big industries each having an investment
of four to five thousand crore rupees and yet we do not get any return on
this investment. We are not getting even the minimum profit or returns. It is
a set back. Consequently, in both the areas, it is the people's money or the
Government's money that is invested but we feel that neither sector is
performing well and delivering the goods and services. At the same time
we continue to face shortage of funds for development in both the areas.
The main reason is that we do not have enough funds in the country to
invest in both the fields. This is nothing new. We have seen this during the
period of Jawaharlal Nehru, Indiraji and Rajivji. During the period of all the
Prime Ministers, we have experienced that capital available is not adequate
to meet all our requirements. And, therefore, today we have to adopt a new
approach.
      Suppose we have to set up a big industry or a plant which needs
5000 crore rupees, then this is the people's money. But if we find some
industrialist who is prepared to invest this amount of 5,000 crore rupees,
then Government will be in a position to save this amount to invest
elsewhere. I have worked out that if in this manner we can save 5,000
crore rupees from just one big industry, we can build one lakh primary
schools. Thus if for these massive projects we could mobilise capital from
outside or from other sources, our own money could be spent on all the
needs of the poor. Just imagine if we can find some​ ​other sources for
investment in infrastructure, in power projects, irrigation etc., our own
people's money would be free for investment in rural areas to help those
who are not so far getting the funds on the desired scale. This is a new
approach. Not absolutely new, but the emphasis is new. We want that our
own funds must be freed from the infrastructure sector by mobilising
investment in that sector from other sources either within the the country or
from the people of Indian origin settled abroad. If for power, irrigation,
cement or steel plants we get investment from other sources, there will be
rapid progress in both the rural and industrial sectors because development
in both the fields is essential. Thus this programme of replacement of
capital by arranging money for one sector from other sources is likely to be
very advantageous. We will see that our rural programmes would gain
momentum in the Eighth Five Year Plan. With great difficulty we could have
provided 14,000 crore rupees for rural programmes for five years, but now
we have decided that this outlay should be raised from 14,000 to 30,000
crore rupees. Thus you will see that we can step up the rural programmes
on a large scale.
      I feel these programmes should move still faster. If instead of 30,000
crore rupees we raise this outlay to 50,000 crore rupees it would be still
better. We are engaged in the efforts to ensure that the funds that are freed
from investment in big projects and programmes are invested in villages.
       Many people are nervous about the consequences of foreign
investment in the country. I want to assert that after all, the plant will be set
up in India. There is no possibility that projects built from foreign investment
would run away from the country. If roads are built and railway lines are
laid, they are bound to remain within the country and there is nothing to be
apprehensive about it. Let us welcome all the investment that is available
because this capital ultimately will be ours and we will derive benefit out of
it. Anyone who makes investment would obviously like to make some profit
and there should be no objection to this, as no one would like to invest if
there is no profit in the investment. We should also make it a point to invest
the capital that is freed from this investment, in rural programmes.
      Now, I want to present before you some details about the
programmes which we have undertaken for the poor during the last one
year. Last year, I had submitted before you that we would undertake these
programmes. I want to apprise you now that we have already started these
programmes and they are progressing. First programme I told you was
about 1,700 blocks where the population consists of very poor people. We
want to undertake a new programme to make foodgrains available to them.
I am very happy that this programme has been launched on a large scale
from 1 January 1992 in 1711 blocks. I launched this programme from
Rajasthan and now this is being taken up everywhere. There was a
shortage of fair price shops. Within six or seven months we have opened
9,000 to 10,000 fair price shops. Perhaps during the next few months we
are going to start 10,000 more. In addition, we are providing additional 20
lakh tonnes of foodgrains for such areas so that the deficit in supplies there
is made up. We have linked this programme with Jawahar Rozgar Yojana.
We have made a special allotment of eight lakh tonnes of foodgrains for the
purpose.
        The intention is that under Jawahar Rozgar Yojana, part of the wages
must be paid in the shape of foodgrains so that labourers do not face
starvation. And it is our estimate that when part of the wages are paid in the
shape of foodgrains each person would get two kg of rice or wheat per day
and in this manner we would be able to overcome the problem of starvation
in those areas.
        Another problem that I talked about last year was about rural artisans
still using outmoded tools. They are unable to increase their productivity
and to get rid of their poverty. They are migrating to big cities, and a new
problem is emerging there. I had said that to upgrade these tools we would
be undertaking a large programme of modernisation. I am happy to say that
this programme has already taken off. In the current year, we are going to
implement the programme of equipping artisans in 40,000-50,000 villages
with modern tools and this programme will continue during the next four to
five years. It is a very massive but very useful programme because if the
rural artisans do not stay in the village, the village would never prosper, and
remain backward. Therefore, this programme has been launched.
        Next I had said that the revenue records and the records of rights
over land in our villages are not maintained properly. The result is that
there is protracted litigation which often leads to bloody fights and
therefore, a programme for their improvement was needed. I am happy to
inform you that we have addressed ourselves to this task and a scheme
has already been framed. We are going to call a meeting of Revenue
Ministers to urge them to complete this job within a specified timeframe,
may be a year or two.
        About land ceiling I had said that whatever land is available with the
Government under the ceiling laws and which has not been distributed
would be distributed completely. This work has nearly been completed.
Only a part of it is yet to be completed. On a large scale about two lakh
acres of land has been distributed and it is our determination that within
three to four months, we should reach a stage in which there should be no
undistributed surplus land. The entire land will be given to landless people.
This programme will also be completed.
       As declared last year, a corporation for the welfare of the backward
classes has been set up. I am happy to inform you that this corporation has
been started with a capital of Rs. 200 crore and a complete programme has
been chalked out for the welfare of the backward classes.
       The changes which are taking place at present could in some cases
affect our workers in the industrial sector. To protect them from any
adverse impact, we have set up a National Renewal Fund with a capital of
about Rs. 2,200 crores. We would ensure that wherever our workers are
adversely affected and wherever there is a problem of employment for
them, we would extend full help to them out of this fund. We will also
ensure that they face no difficulty and whatever programmes for their
retaining etc., are needed, are funded out of this fund.
       I would like to draw special attention of our farmers in far-flung areas
where there is no electricity and perhaps where it is not possible to provide
electricity in the near future. For such villages we have formulated a solar
energy programme in the Five Year Plan with an outlay of Rs. 800 crores.
Never before was so much attention paid and so much money provided for
such a programme. This is largely because our Lord Surya is the biggest
source of energy for us.
       We should fully exploit this source. Here comes the question of
technology. Theoretically this is possible, but, when the question of
technology comes, it is said that these solar pumps are very costly and
farmers cannot afford them.
       On the basis of the results of experiments made by our scientists, it
can now be said that by reduction in costs, we can bring them within the
affordable limit of our farmers. Efforts in this direction have been successful
and the result is that in our far-flung areas where there is no electricity,
there will be “stand alone” units on wells, that is, each well will have a solar
panel installed on it, along with the pump. The solar panel would draw
energy from the Sun and convert this into electricity which would energise
the pump. This programme would be undertaken on a large scale and this
would meet the energy requirements of the villagers. Whatever electricity is
required for other purposes in the village will be generated there itself.
       Wherever these experiments have been made, they have been very
popular with the farmers. The reason is that normal electricity is not reliable
because of its erratic supply, and therefore, it adversely affects agriculture.
Hence, this new energy programme has appealed to them. I am happy to
inform you that we are going to launch this programme on a large scale.
I referred to Five Year Plans. We are going to undertake a massive
programme of wasteland development because there are large areas of
wasteland in all the villages. We are making efforts to develop them by
planting trees and to make them green and fertile. This programme will
provide employment to millions of people. With this in mind, we have set up
a new department so that proper attention is paid to this programme. We
have made a large financial provision for this in our Plan.
      Now, I want to inform you that the programme we have launched
during the last one year for the welfare of weaker sections and minorities
have been carried out on a large-scale. For Scheduled Castes and
Scheduled Tubes, a Corporation has been formed. For women, a National
Commission has been set up. To make them fully effective to enable them
to carry out their responsibilities, we have vested them with sufficient
powers. Similarly, the Minorities Commission has also been given statutory
status and vested with wide powers to protect interests of the minorities.
Thus, this Commission is now as empowered as any other statutory
commission. We hope that this would be very helpful and effective for the
protection and progress of the minorities.
      As I said just now, a Corporation has been set up for the backward
classes; we want that the profession of safai karamcharis which is below
human dignity should be abolished. In the Eighth Five year Plan, we have
provided 560 crore rupees for this. There is no doubt that, if required, this
provision can be enhanced. Along with this we have decided to constitute a
commission to look into the problems of our safai karamcharis. This
Commission is in a process of constitution and it would come into being in
the next few days. This will go a long way in understanding the problems of
the neglected section of the society.
       I would now like to dwell upon a few issues which we have inherited
and which we are facing. You know about Punjab where after long years an
elected Government has come into power. I am very happy that this
Government is doing a good job and people are extending their full
cooperation to it. I would also tell you in the context of Punjab that we are
fully seized of the problems which have emerged there and we are very
serious about finding solutions to them. There can be no hasty decision
and we have to take every step with a cool mind in consultation with all
concerned. Though some people say that nothing is happening, let me
assure that this is not so. Shortly you will have an indication of what we
intend to do and in which direction we are moving. In the meantime, law
and order is being maintained effectively, and as you all know we have
gained some successes. It is true that killings are still continuing. This is not
a happy situation. It shocks us and hurts us. But when we are locked in this
struggle, some losses are inevitable. But by and large the situation there is
satisfactory and I am waiting for the day when complete peace will prevail
in Punjab. It is a different thing that abetment from across the border is still
continuing there. It is a matter of deep regret that despite our repeated
pleas, our neighbour across the border is not desisting from such activities.
      The situation has improved in Assam and there is no doubt about it.
There has been significant improvement and those who were following the
path of violence have decided to give it up and join the national
mainstream. The majority of such people have come back and surrendered
their weapons. But there are still a few of them who are carrying on
confrontation. We have to tackle them and this is what is being done there.
I hope that this situation would be brought under control shortly.
      Kashmir issue is still hanging fire and the situation is taking uneven
turns but an overall assessment would suggest that the things are under
control. I am not satisfied with this because we cannot be satisfied till every
corner of India comes within the democratic set up. I want to make it clear
that whenever the conditions are conducive there, we are keen to hold free
and fair elections within the framework of Indian Constitution and to install a
popular Government.
      About the issue of Mandal Commission, I have already made my
stand very clear. Right now the issue is before the Supreme Court. In due
course, the judgement will come and it will be implemented. Government's
stand is that backward classes must get 27 per cent reservation and
among them between a poor and a rich candidate, the poor must get it first.
But on the whole, the reserved jobs must be given to backward classes and
should not go beyond. This is our decision. We also want to give 10 per
cent reservation to those who are economically backward. The matter is
before the Supreme Court and we will implement its judgement.
        Now I come to an issue which was threatening to assume a
dangerous shape sometime ago. I am grateful to those people who were
involved in this and because of whose cooperation we could ward off this
countrywide crisis. I am referring to the Ayodhya dispute. This is not just an
issue of a temple or a mosque. I want to make it very clear that it would be
misleading and wrong to view it purely as a problem of temple or mosque.
This is a problem of unity of our country. Today the problem is to preserve
and sustain the traditional harmony which has been existing for centuries in
lakhs of villages of our country and the society. If we take a single wrong
step, we must ponder over the consequences of such a wrong move for the
country, leave alone the temple or mosque. Therefore, we have to take
every step very carefully and with circumspection. Somehow we have been
able to defuse it at a point where it had taken a dangerous turn. There is
still some time available. Within this time limit we want to arrive at a
settlement after consultation with all concerned. This is the consistent
policy of the Government that a solution to this problem should be evolved
through negotiations with all concerned. Such a solution must satisfy the
religious sentiments of both the communities. For some reason if this is not
possible, then the decision of the court would be binding on all. And in fact
this is our formula in a nutshell. It is our desire that a grand temple should
be built there, but the mosque must remain intact. We would like to pursue
this aim in our efforts. During the talks if it is possible to find a solution that
is acceptable to all, then it would be a very happy development and none
would object to it. The people of the country must know what the
Government is doing and with what aim.
       Now, I would like to say something about the international situation.
Our relations with our neighbouring countries are improving very well.
However, it is difficult to say the same thing in the context of Pakistan. I
have had talks with the Prime Minister of Pakistan four times. Our talks
have been very good, but when the time comes to take a step ahead, some
development or the other takes place that leaves us where we were. Who
is doing this? Why? And how? This is a matter of one's own conjecture. I
think the talks will have to continue. But we should be very clear in our
minds that Kashmir is an integral part of India and no power on earth can
separate Kashmir from India. This is our basic position. If this is accepted,
we can consider any other understanding or compromise required, and will
continue to work for improvement in our relations. But this will be our
bottom line. There should be no doubt about this.
       With other countries like America, Britain, Germany, Japan etc., our
relations are very good. Whatever new countries have come into existence
after the disintegration of USSR, which was our close friend, our relations
are very good with them. Their Heads of State have visited our country and
I have also received invitations to visit their countries. Our relations with
them are getting closer and friendlier.
       India has to play a more active role in international relations. We have
the Non-Aligned Movement. We have seen that there has been slight let-up
in this Movement during these last two to three years. We will reactivate it.
      Now, in the end I would like to make a few submissions. In this
country where the majority of our people are honest and law abiding, there
are also some corrupt elements. Some people indulged in loot and illegal
deals in banks and the stock market. This episode surfaced suddenly and
then we realised that before the lapses are covered up or the evidence
destroyed, action should be taken against those who are guilty.
      As soon as the Government got the information, all necessary steps
were taken. The persons have been arrested. A special court has been set
up. The investigation is going on in full swing and let me assure you that
whosoever is involved in this and whosoever is found guilty would be dealt
with strictly and severe punishment would be awarded. As far as prevention
of recurrence of such activities is concerned, it is now for the Parliament to
decide about the preventive measures. A committee of the Members of
Parliament has already been constituted and it has already started
functioning. The Government would follow its advice. Let me once again
assure you that in this country, to the extent it is within the power of the
Government, there will be no place for corruption or corrupt people and no
one would be spared whatever be his or her status. The law will take its
course, no one can escape punishment according to the law. There will be
no leniency in this regard. I would like to make it clear before you.
      It is my appeal to you that we need peace for the next two to three
years. In our country we have problems that bring the people together and
there are also problems which divide the people. It is not possible that for
the next two to three years, we declare a moratorium on raising such
problems which divide us. These problems will remain, but we should
forget about them. They may be raised again after sometime when
controversies are resumed. But for the next two to three years, there
should be no scope for such conflicts. All the problems are national
problems and they affect the entire society. Of course, we attend to the
problems which are already on hand. We can put aside new contentious
problems. I hope that my appeal for a moratorium would be accepted by
other parties also. If the people accept it, no one could refuse. It would be
of immense help to the country.
      I want to make one more submission. This is my promise: We will not
take any hasty decision. Hasty decisions by the Government add later to
the difficulties. When the decision is taken in a hurry, it may seem good, but
adverse consequences have to be faced later and add to the
complications. Therefore, we would not do anything in a hurry. We will do
everything after careful consideration. But every step we take, will be firm
and once we move ahead, we will not retreat. Our approach will not be
partisan approach. Our vision would be a vision for the good of the entire
country and entire society. This is the approach that we want to follow.
      I would appeal to you to give a serious thought to these three points. I
wish that if we can develop a national consensus on these three points and
if we move ahead together, then we shall be able to overcome the
problems that we have inherited and not only this, but we would be able to
make tremendous progress in taking the country ahead so that we may
come up on par with other countries. If this does not happen because of
our involvement in petty problems, we will remain backward. I want to
submit very humbly that you must ponder over these aspects. If you all give
your blessings to these three principles (Sutras), no one can dare oppose
them. I want the blessings of my countrymen and their support for these
three points which I am sure I will receive.
      I have taken enough time. Yet, there are many things that I wanted to
share with you, but I will have other occasions for that. Today, on this
occasion, we have to move towards a future that is full of hope. There have
been many happy developments and there have been less happy things
too. They have to be dealt with. On the whole, the future appears to be full
of hope and I call upon you and invite you to march forward towards that
future and I seek the blessings of all of you."
1991,P.V. Narasimha Rao,INC,Let Us March Ahead Hand in Hand,"Free rendering of Independence Day Speech in Hindi from the ramparts of the Red Fort, 15 August 1991","P.V. Narasimha Rao, selected speeches, Vol 1",NA,"I offer my hearty greetings to you on the auspicious occasion of the
forty-fourth anniversary of the Independence Day of our country. It is a
tribute to democracy that an ordinary worker like me, born in a small
village, is able to address you from the ramparts of this historic Red Fort. It
is due to your blessings and my good fortune.
      You are aware that numerous people made sacrifices for this
freedom and nurtured it with their blood. The great chariot of democracy
has been moving forward steadily and shall keep going ahead.
      During the last 44 years, elections were held for the Lok Sabha ten
times. The Tenth General Elections were held only recently. During these
elections, your anger as well as your appreciation have found expression.
We have accepted with humility the mandate given by you. We belong to
you, we are from amongst you and will continue to be a part of you. These
are our credentials, and we do not need any other identity.
       The elections for Tenth Lok Sabha were held in the shadow of a
tragedy. Rajiv Gandhi's brutal assassination had stunned the country. The
sudden disappearance of a young man, who was perceived to have solved
the problem of leadership of our country for the next 20 to 25 years,
plunged us all into darkness. But what can be done? We know that
everyone who is born is destined to die one day. If death occurs after a full
life, we accept it, but an untimely death causes distress. We will implement
the agenda that Rajivji had prepared for the future of the country. And I
stand before you with the resolve to follow the path shown by him.
       I want to apprise you of the critical phase that the country is passing
through today. This Government has completed 55 days in office. During
this period we have taken certain decisions and avoided certain pitfalls.
The people gave us the mandate to form the Government but it was short
of the necessary majority. We accepted the mandate of the people and
formed the Government. We will not spare any effort to ensure that the
country marches ahead towards progress. The co-operation extended to us
by other political parties has made the situation optimistic. It is my first
belief that there is no reason to entertain any doubt about the stability of
this Government.
     Very briefly I want to place before you the situation inherited by this
Government. We inherited a situation which was vitiated by
fundamentalism, hatred among castes and social unrest.
       The economy was in the grip of a serious crisis that was
unprecedented in the history of free India. Our financial credibility had
touched the nadir. In a week or two, we would have been unable to repay
our loans. I assumed the office in such a situation. Many of the problems
were there for a long time, but during the last two years they grew in their
complexity. This was part of our legacy. Things appeared to go out of hand.
There was no scope for delay, and procrastination would have been
suicidal. Therefore, we had to undertake certain prompt measures. We took
bold decisions. We have been able to arrest the deterioration which was
creeping in. A lot more has got to be done, but certainly we have arrested
the situation from deteriorating further.
      You are all aware that we produce so many things in the country for
our requirements. But there are some items that we still have to import.
There are some commodities which we produce, but the quality we
produce is not enough to meet our needs. Therefore, we have to import
commodities like kerosene oil, diesel, edible oil, fertilizers, etc. To import
these we need foreign exchange as the Rupee is not convertible abroad.
Our foreign exchange reserves have been woefully depleted. Even today
we are not in a comfortable position and therefore we will have to boost our
exports. The goods that we produce will be exported and we will get foreign
exchange in return. Therefore, first of all, we have done away with the
system of licences, permits etc. as this complex system created many
obstacles for the people. Now we have broken this vicious circle, and
liberated those who were stuck in it.
      We have paved the way for increasing our exports by slightly
changing the exchange rate of the Rupee. We trust that in the coming days
our exports would get a boost and we would be able to earn enough foreign
exchange. We have presented our new budget in which we have
formulated a number of schemes for public welfare, especially keeping in
view the needs of our population.
      I want to give a brief account of some of these programmes. We have
done a lot but I would like to discuss a few of them as there is not enough
time for a detailed presentation. As you know, we have prepared an
extensive programme in the memory of Rajivji ​which aims at ​providing
drinking water to every village in the country. You know that drinking water
has been provided to a number of villages during the last forty years. Yet
there are a few far-flung villages where there is a scarcity of drinking water.
Therefore we are taking up 80,000 such villages in which drinking water will
be made available under the programme named after Rajivji.
      We have to improve the lot of our backward classes. To help them we
are setting up a corporation.
      We know that occasionally communal riots occur in our country. In
these riots many people get killed, some become crippled and many
children are rendered orphans with none to look after them. For these
children we have set up a National Fund. This fund would be utilised to
educate and bring up such children so that they get all opportunities to
grow as worthy citizens of this country.
      In our country, at times, the workers lose their jobs. Once they
become jobless, none cares for them. We have formulated a plan to help
them and rehabilitate them in alternative vocations by giving them training
so that they do not become unemployed.
       You know that our villages have got gifted craftsmen. They are
second to none in their skills but their tools are outmoded. There are nearly
5.5 lakh villages in this country. Now, you can imagine how many
craftsmen are there in every village working with outmoded tools. We have
prepared a scheme to provide modern tools for all such craftsmen so that
they do not migrate from villages to cities. By using better tools they can
earn much more in the villages. Such migration creates problems in the
cities. Therefore, once better tools are made available to them the
craftsmen will have no compulsion to rush to cities and they can enhance
their income by remaining in the villages.
       The most important thing is our Public Distribution System under
which we have fair price shops, which are now largely concentrated in
cities. The Public Distribution System has not yet reached the villages. We
have decided to take up 1500 blocks in far-flung tribal, desert and very
backward areas to provide at least one fair price shop in each village. In
these shops people can get the commodities of their daily consumption at a
reasonable rate. This would be a big boon for the people living in our
villages.
       You must also be aware that there are frequent land disputes and
often they assume such violent proportions that the real issues are pushed
into the background. And a lot of litigation continues for years, ruining the
people. The source of these conflicts are the land records which are not
kept properly. The only method to avoid this is to keep our land records in
the villages properly so that people know about their ownership and
proprietary rights. We want to launch this campaign throughout the country
so that in every village proper land records are made available.
      Rajivji had given us Indira Mahila Yojana but during the last two
years, there has been no implementation of this scheme. We will revive
and implement it. You know that the Panchayati Raj Bill was not allowed to
take the shape of law. We will now have it passed and implement it.
      I want to impress upon our non-resident Indian brothers that we want
to welcome them here. We want to offer them many facilities here. We are
ready to offer whatever facilities they require for making investments and
set up industries. We want to strengthen the age-old bonds. We are proud
of them. Lakhs of Indians have gone abroad. They have become
prosperous. Even today they are determined to serve their country. Once
again I extend to them a very cordial welcome.
     Now I want to speak to you about certain burning problems before the
country. As I mentioned earlier, the feeling of hatred is rampant. There is a
spate of violence. We have to change this in this country, which is the
abode of non-violence. There is no place for violence here. India, which
believes in world peace, will have no right to talk about it, unless there is
peace in the country.
      There are then the problems of Punjab and Kashmir. In these states
violence, separatism and terrorism are prevalent. I want to make it clear
that none is going to gain out of terrorism. The only result is bloodshed and
loss of lives. Those who are indulging in such activities will never be able to
achieve their aims. We should return to the path of peace and I appeal to
them that they should co-operate with us in evolving a solution to the
problems of this country, problems of Punjab and problems of Kashmir.
Together we can find the solutions. There is no problem which is
insurmountable.
      We surely want elections in Punjab, but we would not tolerate the use
of elections to promote separatism. We will ensure that elections are held
within the parameters of the Constitution.
       About Kashmir, I want to assert we are confident of facing the
situation there. We will contain terrorism. As far as Kashmir is concerned
there is the Shimla Agreement between India and Pakistan, and we will try
to resolve the problems according to that agreement. This has been our
endeavour so far and the same holds good for the future. We do not
require any mediation. We are neighbouring countries and we will solve our
problems between ourselves. All the problems can be solved, if there is
understanding on the other side and if the activities of abetting and aiding
violence are stopped from that side.
       During the last two or three years a strange dispute has cropped up
over the mosque and the temple. The foundation of our country is
secularism. It is neither anti-religion nor fanning communalism in the name
of religion. We wish to remain secular. Religion is a personal affair. The
Government, its policies and programmes have got nothing to do whether
someone visits the temple or someone else goes to the mosque. We are
not going to give up secularism. We may need the help of others for
running the Government, but we cannot take this country ahead if we give
up the basic principles. This country will disintegrate the day we give up
secularism. Therefore, we must stick to it. Religion binds people. It
generates spiritual thinking and improves our material and spiritual well
being. The use of religion in politics to secure votes in elections is certainly
not desirable. I hope people will understand this and will not allow such
designs to succeed.
      By secularism we also believe that minorities should be given full
protection and therefore we are going to give legal status to the Minorities
Commission. There is no danger to any religion here. I must say that the
slogans about this or that religion being in danger are absolutely bogus. In
this country there has never been any threat to any religion nor will there
ever be. We want to guarantee this. It is the firm resolve of this
Government that there should be no threat to any religion; and if a threat
was ever there, we would eliminate it. This danger will never be there. We
have to guard against such slogans.
      We then have the issue of Mandal Commission which relates to our
people belonging to the backward castes and backward classes. We
certainly want social justice. We have undertaken several programmes to
achieve this. In many States these programmes are continuing but we do
not want social disintegration to attain social justice. We do not want the
achievement of social justice by violence or by creating mutual
confrontation. This cannot happen. It would lead to many other afflictions.
We have faith that we can solve this problem peacefully and by consensus.
I have discussed this with many people. I feel that on this issue, there is
consensus to a large extent. Though the process is not yet complete, a
broad consensus can be arrived at. I wish that this issue be resolved on the
basis of a national consensus. Our efforts in this direction will continue.
      Our farmers give us food and for them an extensive programme is
before us. The farmers produce foodgrains but the production of several
commodities will have to be stepped up so that we can export them to earn
foreign exchange. I invite our farmers who have provided food for us to
come forward now to produce for export and make this country prosperous.
      I would like to tell our armed forces that the Government is always
alive to their interests and their welfare and there are several schemes
before us. For want of time I cannot outline them but I want to assure them
that we are preparing many schemes for them and we shall always be
ready to look after their interests.
      Friends, today the main problem before the country is economic. We
have to increase our production as well as the wealth of this country. If
wealth does not increase there will be nothing to distribute and it is not
prudent to distribute poverty. Therefore, the need of the hour is that we
should add to our wealth and ensure its just distribution. For this we have
formulated a programme and the Government is keeping both these
aspects in view. We have to generate employment and for increasing
employment opportunities industrialisation is needed. The industry cannot
remain outdated. A new environment has got to be created. We are
engaged in this. If the capacity of industry does not develop, it will lag
behind and we shall not be able to compete in the world market. Therefore,
the capacity of the industry has got to be developed.
      Besides tackling the economic issue, we must also ensure that there
is no disintegration. Social unrest should not be there and people should
not waste their energy and time fighting each other. I want to impress upon
you that this has got to be stopped at any cost. Social unity and national
unity are not separate from each other. Both are two sides of the same coin
and therefore we have to take care of them.
     I think that it is our foremost duty to uphold national unity, social unity
and maintain social equilibrium so that there is no setback to social
harmony. To achieve this we will continue to make all out efforts and, as I
have said, this is the duty of all of us and we should perform this sincerely.
      There are many things that I wanted to discuss with you but there is
not enough time. But I will keep in touch with you and inform you about the
various programmes and the steps that we propose to take from time to
time. Today I would only like to say that the country is at a very precarious
juncture and there are many dangers, both internal and external, looming
large on the horizon. To face them we need unity. Once again I offer my
greetings to you on this auspicious occasion. I offer my best wishes for a
very happy year of India's Independence to all of you. May this country
scale new heights of progress in the coming year. I am grateful to all of you
for giving me a patient hearing and I hope that you will fulfil your duties and
will help the Government in performing its duties. You and me are not
separate. We have to work together. Let us march ahead hand in hand."
1990,V.P. Singh,Janata Dal,Pledge to Keep the Flag Flying,"Free rendering of the address in Hindi on Independence Day, Delhi, 15 August 1990","V.P. Singh, Selected Speeches and Writings, 1989-90",NA,"Today, on the occasion of Independence Day, I offer my hearty
greetings to you. History took a turn about 43 years ago and Pandit
Jawaharlal Nehru hoisted the beautiful tricolour of independent India at this
very place raising waves of hopes among crores of people. This flag of
ours symbolises our struggle, our resolve and our strength. On this
occasion, we express our respect to the freedom fighters and offer our
tribute to martyrs. Entire nation bows its head in honour of their memory.
       In fact a country, where memorials to the martyrs are in shambles,
gets ruined. We, therefore, remember our martyrs, freedom fighters who
have strengthened our nation. Today, we remember Bapu, Pandit
Jawaharlal Nehru, Jayaprakash Narayan, Sardar Patel, Maulana Azad,
Sardar Bhagat Singh, Subhas Chandra Bose. The names of martyrs and
freedom fighters are legion and it is not possible to recount all those
names. I also want to recall those names which never found a mention in
newspapers and nobody knows about them but who sacrificed themselves
to win independence for the country. We also remember them today. I
recall those days when the British showered bullets, but those were the
days of freedom struggle. The British ran short of bullets but the number of
freedom fighters prepared to brave the bullets ever declined. We got our
independence after much sacrifice.
      Today is not only a historic day, but the place also is historic. Delhi
has been a witness to a procession of history. Kurukshetra is not far off
where Lord Krishna gave a clarion call for the Mahabharata and gave his
messages of the Gita. There is Panipat whose memory still reverberates
with clinking of swords. We can still see afresh the old grandeur if we just
scratch these stones of Red Fort.
      Chandni Chowk has witnessed the rise and fall of many emperors.
Ours is a long history. Even after independence, there is no reduction in
our ordeals. The country has passed through difficult times. But the great
people of this land have emerged with greater strength from each ordeal.
We passed through periods of war and national calamities. We have also
witnessed transfer of power in a democratic manner. From all these trials
and ordeals, one aspect has come out prominently, that democracy has
taken firm roots here and there is no one who can shake it. People have
always kept the respect and honour of the country high and herein lies our
greater strength.
      The country today is faced with dual challenges. On the one hand,
there is separatism and on the other, violence. Separatism is posing a
challenge for the country's unity and violence is a challenge to democracy.
They pose a challenge to the history of our entire freedom struggle. They
are challenges to our political and social values and to our system. It is not
a challenge to a party or a class but to the entire system. Jammu and
Kashmir, Punjab, Assam are names of different places. Their problems
may also be different. But so far as the challenges of violence and
separatism are concerned it is the same everywhere. We must, therefore,
face them unitedly. Divided they cannot be faced and it had been our
endeavour to unitedly face them. My heart goes to the people of Jammu
and Kashmir for they participated in the freedom struggle. Similarly I feel for
the people of Punjab for they shed blood for the achievement of freedom.
We find the blood marks of both Hindus and Sikhs in Jallianwala Bagh.
       Assam had been our most peaceful State and a solution to its
problem will be found by the people there. I want to tell the people of
Kashmir that secularism has been the symbol of our freedom. Not only the
valley of Kashmir or Assam but the entire country belongs to them. If we
have committed certain mistakes, we are prepared to amend them for they
are our own people. If under the influence of misguided propaganda by
another country, they think about secession, they should recall the tragic
episodes following the independence when lakhs of people migrated to a
neighbouring country where they are still called Muhajirs. They have not
been accepted in that country and are subjected to bullets. Therefore,
those living in Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab and Assam should not think
that they are alone. Entire India with all its power is prepared to fight
against their problems, their difficulties and their woes. They are partners in
the prosperity of the country, I am confident that a day will come when our
misguided youth will realise this and will have equal role in making India a
great nation.
      Soon after this Government assumed office, we went to Harmandar
Sahib to offer our obeisance. We also visited the Durgiana Temple. We
went to the martyrs' memorial at Jallianwala Bagh and prayed for peace in
Punjab.
       But peace has not so far come to Punjab. However, there was a
purpose behind visiting those places. An atmosphere had been created in
the country in which every Sikh was looked at with suspicion. Their self
respect had been hurt. It was to honour them. to show our trust in them, to
tell them that the country recognises with gratitude the sacrifice they have
made for the country and for the freedom, for the success of the green
revolution, for industrial advancement. Now an atmosphere has been
created where there is no air of suspicion and a sense of trust has been
generated.
      The violence, of course, has increased and this is a matter of concern
for us. We have done a lot during this period so as to assuage the hurt
feelings of our Sikh brothers. For this, we have rescinded the 59th
Amendment which was brought about for Punjab. We have released many
innocents who were in jails. Those who left the Army for some reason were
also released from the jails. Courts have been set up for 1984 Delhi riots
victims. It was not done with the intention of bargaining. It was a confidence
building effort. For I believe that the people of Punjab want peace, want to
stay with India, and it would be unjust to club the people of Punjab with
separatists. We will never do so. We have unflinching faith in the people of
Punjab.
     However, on this occasion we will also have to see who is with India
and who is not with India. We cannot have any compromise with forces
which are not with India. We may lose everything but there cannot be any
compromise with the integrity of India.
      Our policy is clear. We will win the people of Punjab with love but will
win anti-national elements through force. We will use both love and arms.
        Today on the occasion of Independence Day, we have to resolve to
fight another freedom struggle. The struggle is under way and before us.
We have to join it. One generation gave us this flag. Our responsibility is to
keep the flag flying. Our Armed forces, our Police forces are bravely facing
the challenges, but it is the duty not only of the Army to die for the country
but of every citizen. Only that country has survived where the citizens have
risen to the occasion. Whether it is Vietnam or Leningrad, the country has
saved itself when the people have stood up. Today we need the same
spirit. If the 80 crore people and youth of the country stand up, we can put
up a human wall on our borders. Then who can dare to cross our borders.
We do not have enough resources to pay salaries and raise the number of
the Army to the level required. We are proud of the sacrifices made by our
Armed Forces. But what we have to consider now is whether Mahatma
Gandhi fought for the freedom by paying salaries to the freedom fighters.
He asked people to make sacrifices for the country and the entire country
responded.
      We desire that the Jawans defend the nation even though we may
have a fistful of grams. It is not the riches that have saved the country but
pledges and sacrifices that saved it. All of us whether those who are sitting
in the ramparts or on the grounds will have to join together to face the
danger on our border. Crossing of borders with arms, we will have to
mentally prepare ourselves. On the occasion of Independence Day, we
remind ourselves of need for vigilance by people. The people should come
forward and I am ready to go with them. It is better to die on the borders
than to watch border violations take place sitting in Delhi. Today the
country demands sacrifice. We must prepare ourselves for this sacrifice by
remembering our martyrs. The fight is to be waged not in the secretariat or
in the North or South Blocks. It has to be carried to the fields of granaries.
The people will rise in the streets. Eighty crore people with hundred sixty
crore hands will rise together and the country will be invincible. No one can
threaten us. But the heart of 80 crore people beat with those of the people
of Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir and they are not different from the rest
of the people of the country.
      We are prepared to make the same sacrifice to protect and to see
that no injustice is done to them. We want to establish there an atmosphere
of peace and justice.
       Along with other problems there is yet another major challenge which
I mentioned about on the very first day, and that is Ram
Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid controversy. It is our endeavour to solve this
problem by mutual understanding amicably, because that is the only
method to solve our problems. But I would like to say that the greatest
temple or mosque is the heart of the human being and if the heart is
broken, there shall neither be a temple nor a mosque. The only abode of
God is the conscience and the heart of the human being. In this context, all
our efforts are aimed at finding an amicable solution to this problem. But
along with that we have to uphold the dignity of the courts. We have got
different religions, different faiths, different languages and people of
different regions. Though we have our own faith, we don't want to hurt
anyone because we have to respect the faith of everyone. But if there are
differences among them, then we have to respect the verdict of the higher
court as the judiciary is above the Government. However, there is still hope
that we shall find a way out.
       Today the people are affected by rising prices. We are concerned, as
the price rise hurts poor people like labourers, rickshaw-pullers, porters
most. We are trying to cope with the economic conditions and inflation for
sometime. There is also the budget deficit. We are trying to overcome
these problems. It will take sometime to bring the situation under control.
We want to make it clear that we will take stern action against those trying
to exploit people's difficulties for profiteering. There shall be no slackness
on this front. It is a fact that higher prices paid by us to the farmers for
sugarcane, wheat and rice had, to some extent, contributed towards the
increase in prices of a few commodities. But those people who toil in the
fields have got their share in the overall prosperity of the country. The most
difficult situation is that of edible oils. The main reason for this is that
production was less by 10 lakh tonnes and therefore, there is a problem
this year. There has been good rainfall everywhere and this would have a
salutary effect on prices. This is a God's gift. But the Saurashtra region,
which is known for its groundnut production did not have the desired rainfall
even this year. I pray today that clouds must go to Saurashtra and shower
rains there, so that they may give substantial relief to us. As far as the
sudden spurt in the prices of petrol, diesel and other petroleum products is
concerned, this problem has been caused by the Middle East situation. If
the price of crude oil goes up even by $1, then the import bill of crude oil
goes up by 400 crore.
      We have to pay Rs 400 crore more in foreign exchange. That is how
our foreign exchange burden has increased from Rs 1600 crore to Rs 2000
crore within the recent few weeks. I want to pose this question before my
countrymen, there is an easy option that we take loans from outside to
import oil. Some quantity will anyway have to be imported. By taking a loan
to cover the entire import of oil, the prices could certainly be brought down.
This will please you, the popularity of the Government will increase and
perhaps my continuance in power will also be more certain. But would you
like me to compromise with the long-term interests of the country to make
my position stronger? This would certainly make the people happy, but this
would not be in public interest. This will be like a doctor prescribing sweets
to a patient of diabetes, simply for the fear that if he doesn't do so the
patient would reject him and he would lose his fees. That doctor would
certainly make the patient happy, but he would also drive the patient to his
death. Every political leader should have the courage and spirit of sacrifice
to present the complete picture and facts before the people to lead them on
the path which is in public interest. I have full faith that once the people
know the real difficulties, they would be willing to make sacrifices and I am
sure that is the farmers get remunerative prices for a year or two, they will
raise bumper crops of oilseeds which will not only meet our internal
requirement, but also enable us to export. I would appeal to you to have
patience. But if anybody indulges in exploiting the difficulties of the people
as regards other commodities, they would be dealt with firmly. There shall
be no let up in this. Along with this, I want to repeat from this platform the
same sentence that I spoke while addressing the nation for the first time. At
that time I said that we have come into power with trust from the villages
and bylanes and we have to uphold the sanctity of the soil and in the last
few months we have tried to do that. We had promised that 50 per cent of
the resources would be invested in the villages and the Eighth Five Year
Plan is being formulated on this very basis. It is provided in this year's
Budget that two-thirds of the debt relief given to the farmers, labourers,
weavers and artisans will be met by the Central Government. As soon as
this Government came into power, I ordered that principles should be laid
down to fix prices to be given to farmers for their produce in a manner that
justice is done to them.
      The farmers got better prices for wheat and rice. Howsoever, much
we may attempt to give benefit to the farmers through the Budget, it does
not reach the poor, like the canal water which is diverted, does not reach
the poor at the other end. By fixing higher prices we have been able to
ensure that these resources amounting to thousands and crores of rupees
reach the farmers without any interruption.
      Today, we have five deficiencies in the agricultural system. We want
to remove them. One is that the per capita national production has gone
down in rural areas. The production has gone up, but the per capita
production has decreased because the population of the villages has
remained same as its percentage in total national production has come
down. There was no balance in the price that farmer secured for his
produce and the price he had to pay for his purchases. The balance was
against him. The third deficiency is that our green revolution was confined
mainly to a few foodgrains. It was mainly for wheat, but oilseeds and pulses
remained outside the purview of this revolution. This imbalance has to be
corrected. The green revolution did not cover all the areas and only few
regions drew benefit out of it. What is causing maximum concern is that
capital investment in agriculture has become almost stagnant. If we take
the price rise into account the farmers did not get fair prices. Keeping all
these problems in view, we shall announce a national agricultural policy
this year. This resolution will earmark the complete agricultural policy. The
Industrial Policy was declared in 1956, but in this country where agriculture
is the backbone of the economy, agricultural policy was never declared.
Therefore, we want to announce a national agricultural resolution so that
future governments are bound by it. We shall be bound by it; succeeding
governments should also abide by it so that the villages continue to
prosper. In this connection we are reminded of the slogan 'Jai Jawan, Jai
Kisan' given by Lal Bahadur Shastri. We shall march ahead by making Jai
Jawan or Jai Kisan as our aim and the next decade of the 90s would be
observed as the farmers' decade. During this decade, we will undo the
injustice which has been done to the farmers during the previous decades.
The decade of the 90s would be a decade of the farmers as agriculture is
the nation's first industry. A doubt was expressed whether agriculture is an
industry or not. I believe that agriculture is the foremost industry of our
nation. Without this industry other industries cannot be sustained. But there
are many ifs and buts in this and during this decade we want to remove
them. This cannot be accomplished overnight but we shall strive with all our
strength to achieve this. There are many hindrances in the trade of the
farmer and we shall remove them. He should be free to sell his produce
anywhere in the country and there should be no restriction on this If there is
any restriction, that should be done away with. All these limitations should
be removed. There are restrictions on its export. They cannot be removed
altogether but we should endeavour to remove them. We have waived the
loans given to the farmers once, but it is not possible to do so every time.
We should find ways to make resources available to them so that they don't
slide into debts.
       Irrigation and power are two main inputs. During the Kisan decade
our effort would be to provide maximum resources to these two sectors.
We also want to dovetail agro-industries with agriculture, because if there
are agro-industries in the villages there will be no exodus of population to
the cities. In the formulation of the Eighth Five Year Plan, the generation of
employment is our main aim and this is done in order to provide
non-farming employment to youth in the villages. We are conscious of the
fact that if the country is to be strengthened, industry also will have to be
strengthened and we cannot ignore it. Industry cannot be strong without a
strong base. It will be our endeavour to make this base strong. We shall
pay special attention towards export promotion. Small-scale industries
require special attention. Red tapism has tied down the potential of industry
and therefore, we have to cut this red tape so that the productive forces get
an impetus. We are happy that demands are being made to give
importance to the poor.
       In my first address to the nation, I had asserted that if our
Government is a sword it will be wielded to secure justice for the poor and
on this auspicious occasion I want to reaffirm that assertion. The place of
poor in the present system where there is a nexus between capital and
power-centres is not new, this struggle has been continuing for centuries.
We know the emperors who occupied the throne in Red Fort, but the
craftsmen who built this magnificent building remain unknown. The statue
in a temple is carved out by a sculptor but when it is installed in a temple,
people know only about the King in whose period the temple was made
and that sculptor is not allowed to enter the temple, leave aside any credit
being given to him. It is the offshoot of the same society and system that
there was no portrait of Bharat Ratna Babasaheb Dr Bhim Rao Ambedkar
in the Central Hall of Parliament though he was the architect who gave the
Constitution to this country. Now we want to ask the question whether we
can give any pride of place to the poor in our system. The poor have a
hand in forming the government through elections but the poor have no
hand in running the government. Do we have the courage to give a share
to the poor in running the government. Those who are called depressed
classes had lost a political battle thousands of years ago. Till today the
result of that political battle has not been reversed. Therefore, it is not the
question of treasury but it is the question of throne. One who occupies the
throne will also control the treasury. Gone are the days when we used to
give doles to the poor from the treasury. He is not fighting for doles. He has
been poor for thousands of years and may endure to remain like that for a
few years more. He is fighting the last battle for his dignity and to live like a
human being. Therefore, we will have to eradicate the system where we
are always the donors, and the poor remain receivers. This relationship of
donors and the receivers will have to be replaced by a feeling of
brotherhood. This would be the change in the new system as we have seen
that in the name of poverty the poor people have been exploited.
      Those who professed to remove poverty kept on vanishing poverty
but the poor continued to recede to the background. Let the persons
engaged in eradication of poverty remove themselves and yield their place
to the poor. The poor would rather get rid of the poverty or be contented
with his destiny. I had said in Rajya Sabha that we waste our time in
making small laws for the poor. We should have the courage to pass a law
in Rajya Sabha, Lok Sabha or Assemblies where decisions are taken to run
the country, that if we have 40 per cent poor in our population, we shall
give 40 per cent seats in Rajya Sabha, Lok Sabha and the Assemblies to
the poor.
      I am happy that leaders of every party, be it leftist or Bhartiya Janata
Party or the Congress, welcomed and supported the suggestion.
      This wide support has enthused us. We want to start this debate
throughout the country and today, on the occasion of the Independence
Day, I want this country to debate this issue. This issue should not only be
debated but we should also take a decision and implement it because the
slogan is: ""Give power and not wealth to the poor and he would bring about
a transformation."" We believe that no section can be uplifted merely by
money. They can develop only if they have a share in power and we are
prepared to provide this share. In this year of justice, in memory of Dr Bhim
Rao Ambedkar, the Government has recently taken a decision to give
reservation to the backward classes in the jobs in government and public
sectors. It is being debated as to how many persons would get economic
benefit out of it. In a sense, taking into account the population of this
country, the government jobs account for only one per cent and out of that
one percent, if one-fourth is given to anyone, it cannot be a course for his
economic betterment though it may have some effect. But our outlook is
clear. Bureaucracy is an important organ of the power structure. It has a
decisive role in decision-making. We want to give an effective share in the
power structure and running of the country to the depressed, downtrodden
and backward people.
       Let us have a look at the system. The backward classes constitute 52
per cent of our population, but in the government jobs its representation is
only 14.5 per cent and among the Class I officers, this is only 4.5 per cent.
How long will this injustice continue? We shall have to do justice. And when
we start doing justice the system gets a jolt and a commotion takes place.
But let us search our conscience and leaving aside as to what we can get
from our country, we should think about giving to those who are have-nots.
This thinking should mould our life. Only such an approach can bring a
change in the lives of people living in huts and toiling masses and this
would be the right change. Ministers and ministries change, even Prime
Ministers change, but the question is as to when the life of people living
under thatched roofs will change? That change would be the correct
change. To bring about such a change we will have to arouse social forces.
I call upon the youth to work for this awakening. I invite them to cooperate
in building a just society because the tear in the eyes of a poor person tear
for some time but later it becomes acid. He tears the page of history to
build his own heaven on earth. So long as the tears in the eyes of poor
keep the eyes wet, it is alright; but after it gets dried his eyes spit fire. It is
the lesson of history that when the eyes of poor turn fiery the palaces of
gold melt and go down the drain. It is not enough to ponder over; we have
to act. Therefore, we have made reservation for the backward classes,
gave statutory status to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes
Commission and brought forward a law to ensure workers' participation in
management to protect their rights and to ensure that the labour have a
share in the management of the country.
      Similarly, in Delhi we see the poor people who come from villages
and live in sewage pipes as they have no roof on their heads. They live on
the road side. We intend to enact a law for their settlement. So many
labourers come from villages to Delhi and construct palatial buildings here,
but they do not have even a hut for themselves. In this context, we are
reminded of Guru Nanak's saying. He had said that we should rate
everybody high and nobody should be considered low. This saying will
become the voice of justice. We also have to see that wealth, which is not
contributing to the growth of the country, is put to productive purposes. In
our country an iron plough is more useful than a diamond necklace as a
diamond necklace does not contribute to productivity. The iron plough of a
farmer, on the other hand, helps us in production. As far as the urban
property is concerned the existing laws have many loopholes and we have
to remove them. We shall also have to decide whether a single person
needs a big bungalow for his accommodation. In a country where even
huts are not available, what is the justification of building houses spread
over acres. This matter should be debated and on this also we will take a
decision. Youth are the mainstay of the nation. Theirs is the voice of new
age. But the biggest problem of the youth is employment. In the Eighth Five
Year Plan, employment has been given a pivotal importance. We are
determined to fulfil our resolve to give constitutional status to the right to
work with the support and cooperation of all the parties. Within the
resources available for development and our commitments in other fields,
we will certainly make a beginning. No government can assure government
jobs to all. But if one is prepared to work, job opportunities should be
available. But the problem is that we are more interested in management
rather than in actual work. Therefore, we want to become managers and
not workers. So far as we are concerned, we are not among workers.
When we talk about right to work, we will have to keep in view the social
parameters according to which a worker should be respected, then only the
right to work can be really fruitful. You will be happy to know that the
Government has increased budget provision from Rs 20 crore to Rs 265
crore for the welfare of youth. This amount will be spent during the current
year.
        Under this provision, the young people who are qualified in different
professions, will be given assistance and loan through the banks to the
tune of Rs 120 crore for employment. Similarly, provision has been made
for Rs 50 crore for giving loans from banks to the poor students who are
unable to pursue higher studies. In the same manner, for the rural youth a
sum of Rs 70 crore will be provided under different employment schemes.
However, this is a question of resources. As far as young people are
concerned, all the resources of the nation are theirs and they are to inherit
all the national resources. But the greatest resource are the young people
themselves. They are more important than the budget of any country and
the government. Therefore, when the young generation is called upon to do
something, it is not for an ordinary task, the call to bring about a complete
transformation. Today, I exhort the young people to remove the curse of
the illiteracy. If one literate young person imparts the light of knowledge by
teaching 4 or 5 persons, the entire country will be illuminated by the light of
knowledge and the darkness of ignorance and illiteracy will be dispelled.
      Let us make a resolve. If every young person makes such a resolve,
it would be a great service to the nation. Similarly, there is a question of
population and we have to think about it. The young generation should take
up a programme to educate and motivate people to limit the size of their
families. The government also will give all support and facilities. In this
manner we can find a solution to a big problem.
       Women in India have been always enjoying great respect in the
society. But the present social and economic system has pushed them
backward. It is not because they lack competence or capability: they are
also not wanting in courage but we have tied them down to household
chores. A nation grows in the lap of women. They bring up the nation,
nurture our traditions and uphold our culture. But in spite of this great
contribution, they have no role in running the country. If we keep a mother
in chains, there can be no vitality in the nation. How a nation can vibrate
with life if women who are the sources of life remain suffocated. Therefore,
we have decided to make a beginning by giving them their share in power.
In this very session, a bill is being tabled in Parliament to provide for 30 per
cent seats for women in Panchayati Raj. Along with this the National
Commission for Justice for Women with Judicial powers will also be set up.
I hope that all these measures will help us in solving their innumerable
problems.
     On this day, we can't forget our valiant Defence forces: our Army, our
Navy and our Air force. When we think of them, we feel proud. They have
always upheld the dignity of the nation by their sacrifices. When even my
thoughts go to the Jawans in Siachen, and the Himalayas, I feel that the
morale of our Jawans in Slachen is higher than the Himalayas.
      You will be happy to note that Akash missile which we had been
developing was successfully launched yesterday. This is a matter of great
pride for us and our scientists. I want to express my gratitude to them.
      On this occasion we cannot forget our ex-servicemen. The
Government have already taken important decisions about their pension
and soon it will be placed before the Parliament. But I do not consider
ex-servicemen to be merely pensioners. They are the symbol of our unity.
When they were in uniform they had together taken a vow for sacrifice
irrespective of the fact whether they were Hindu, Muslim, Sikh or Christian
or whether they were Tamil speaking, Punjabi speaking, Rajasthani
speaking or Bengali speaking. My dear ex-servicemen, you are not only
pensioners, you had provided leadership when you were in uniform. Today,
when you are not in uniform you should provide leadership to the society
and foster the same sense of unity as you did while you were in uniform.
There, all were one. Be it Hindu, Muslim, Sikh or Christian or whatever may
be the language, you should remove this feeling wherever you are and you
should provide leadership to the society. This emotional unity is our biggest
strength and this has not been achieved in a day. It has taken centuries to
bring about this composite culture embracing different religions and beliefs.
We cannot afford to lose this legacy. Any strain on it will also affect the
nation. The country is not a map on a paper. The map of the nation is in the
hearts of people of that country. If there are divisive lines in the hearts, they
will be reflected on the land also. We would not allow these divisive lines to
emerge. Here, I want to quote Jan Nisar Akhtar who presents a profile of
this culture, ""This country is a synthesis of Hindu and Muslim cultures. This
saying is centuries old but this is so fresh even today."" We have to maintain
this freshness.
      A challenge has come before us. The question is not of poverty but is
that of alienation. The human being can tolerate poverty; but he cannot
tolerate that he should be treated as an alien. The question is not of
convenience but is that of participation and we want to involve the
minorities in the development of the country and in education. Whatever
may be our development, be it the case of banks or jobs, justice should be
done to the minorities. We want to march towards justice.
       It has been the demand that in this country we have holiday on the
birthday of the propounders of all the religions, but there is no holiday on
the birthday of Prophet Mohammad. Today, I want to declare that the
Government has decided that the birthday of Prophet Mohammad will be
observed as a holiday. This was the grouse that the facility given to all the
religions was denied to a big minority.
       Today, the relation between Iraq and Kuwait is causing anxiety to us.
We do not support violence anywhere in the world, nor do we endorse
military intervention. Along with this, there should be no unilateral action.
We are worried about the life and property of the Indians there. Therefore,
we have sent our Cabinet colleague, Shri Arif Mohammad Khan to have a
firsthand assessment of the difficulties and problems of Indians there and
to make arrangements for those who want to come. We are in touch with
different countries to find out a solution without the use of force or armies.
Our relations with other countries have generally improved. I have been to
Russia. President Gorbachev has taken a new initiative in the world and is
bringing about revolutionary changes in his country. I had an occasion to
see them and exchange ideas. My discussions with President Gorbachev
have not only strengthened the traditional friendship between India and the
USSR but they also helped us in deciding the course we have to follow in
the world. Our relations with America have improved. Their stand has come
closer to our position on issues of Jammu and Kashmir, plebiscite and
Simla Agreement. We welcome this With China, exchange of views is
continuing in a positive manner. We have solved the problems with Nepal
and our good relations with Bhutan, Maldives and Mauritius are being
maintained. With Bangladesh also our relations have improved. Tin Bigha
was an irritant which has been removed and now the talks on distribution of
waters are continuing in an atmosphere of understanding. We are
concerned about the Tamils of Indian origin in Sri Lanka and about their life
and property. For them we have taken an initiative that within Sri Lanka,
there should be a camp where they should live securely. The talks are
continuing and I hope, other countries will also be helpful in these efforts.
But I will not allow the extremists or militants to use Indian soil as their
centre. We want peace, peace in Sri Lanka and peace in India, and will
pursue this policy. While our relations have improved with others, it is
unfortunate that in spite of our friendly intentions, our relations with
Pakistan have not shown any improvement. All these are before you and
much has been said about them. I do not want to repeat them on this
occasion, but would like to say two things. We want friendship and if they
move one step forward we will reciprocate by moving two steps. But along
with this, there should be no compromise on the sovereignty and integrity
of the country. If there is any evil intention, the whole country would rise
and face it. We have tried to establish democratic values. In place of
personalised politics we are pursuing issue-based politics. If today we are
getting support from BJP and Leftist parties it is not for an individual, it is for
programmes.
      We are getting the support on the basis of issues. There are some
maladies in the institutions of this country. We need your support to change
this. We have strengthened the foundations of democracy by
decentralisation of power, by introducing Panchayati Raj, the Lok Pal Bill,
giving autonomy to TV and Radio and setting up the Inter-State Council.
But these are institutional changes. Today, our thoughts go to the
greatness of India and its past. On this occasion, I pledge that I will not all
the dignity of this flag to be sullied. I call upon farmers, workers, young
people, women, industrialists, writers, children -- who may not be eligible to
vote for a change of government but even a child can come forward to save
the country - to maintain the dignity of India. This is not an easy path. There
are many difficulties, but we are brave sons and daughters of a brave India.
Bravery flows in our blood. We cannot be disheartened even if there are
storms. Not a thread of this flag can be separated. We will not be terrified
even if there are thunderstorms or lightning. We will convert this lightning
into beacon light for the nation and in this light we will find a way out. On
this occasion, I would like you to join me in raising the slogan given by
Subhas Chandra Bose, at the top of your voice so that the country
reverberates with its echo from the Himalayas to Kanya Kumari. That
slogan is: “Jai Hind”."
1989,Rajiv Gandhi,INC,Restoring the old Glory of India,"Independence Day speech (Hindi) from Red Fort, 15 August 1989","Rajiv Gandhi, Selected Speeches and Writings, Vol 5",NA,"My fellow countrymen; Today I want to convey my greetings on
Independence Day to everyone from Kanya Kumari to Karakoram and from
Kutch to Arunachal Pradesh and also to all Indians living in different parts
of the world. India attained Independence 42 years ago and Panditji hoisted
the Tri-colour for the first time in Free India.
       Today, while hoisting the flag, I feel that I am not alone but with me in
unfurling the flag are, the hands of 80 crore people of India. Ours is a
historic flag. Under this Tri-colour we have fought for our freedom, we have
made the country strong and taken it forward. Flag hoisting on
Independence Day symbolises freedom of India and freedom of every
Indian. Today, on the occasion of Independence Day, our thoughts go back
to lakhs of freedom-fighters, many of whom we do not know, and their
names are buried in history. Sacrifices of thousands of them are not
recorded in history. To those freedom fighters who are with us today, we
express our gratitude. We are reminded of our freedom fighters whenever
we think of independent India. They faced numerous challenges to liberate
the country, to strengthen it and take her forward. They made great
sacrifices and waged a relentless struggle. But, today our thoughts turn
specially to Gandhiji, Shastriji and Indiraji. Gandhiji charted a new course
for our struggle for freedom, Panditji gave a new direction and led the
nation on the path of progress. Shastriji and Indiraji faced formidable odds
in strengthening and protecting the unity and integrity of India.
      Today, we must also keep in mind that the freedom struggle of India
was a unique revolutionary movement. There have been only two or three
such movements earlier in history. One was that of America, the other that
of France and yet another was that of Russia. Then came the revolutionary
movement of India. But while the earlier three movements were marked by
waves of violence, India under the leadership of Gandhiji adopted a new
course. During the dark days of servitude, Gandhiji showed us a path
derived from the heritage of our country. This brought us back to the course
of our history and culture. India grew strong by that principled approach. On
the strength of those very principles we could win Independence, grow
strong and preserve our freedom. But what were the principles propounded
by Gandhiji? They were not new; he only rediscovered them from our
history and culture for us. Foremost amongst them was Ahimsa
(non-violence). But when Gandhiji talked of Ahimsa, he had a much larger
perspective in mind. By Ahimsa he did not mean merely the absence of
violence; what he meant was that we should not even have a feeling of
violence in our hearts which has to be suppressed. He led us on the path of
truth, non-violence, tolerance and compassion. He taught us that the
history and heritage of India clearly reflected that humanity was one,
irrespective of caste, colour, creed, religion, language and region. With
these ideals, Gandhiji made us strong. These very ideals which gave us
strength, also gave us freedom and enabled us to sustain it.
       Gandhiji taught us that if India has to develop, if the people of India
were to be really free, then this freedom and development have to start
from the village level. Only then can we really claim that we are free.
Gandhiji strove hard but certain capitalist forces did not let him succeed.
His hands were tied and development at that time could not start from the
village level.
      The entire country had great affection for Gandhiji. It is difficult to
describe in words the deep and strong bonds that existed between Gandhiji
and the people of the country; yet there were a few amongst us who killed
Gandhiji. Gandhiji was assassinated by the communal forces. We must
understand and be clear in our minds that communal forces did not kill
Gandhiji only to eliminate him but to disintegrate the newly independent
country before it got its moorings. However, these designs could not
succeed because Gandhiji had given such strength to India that it would
never fall or break.
      After the assassination of Gandhiji, Panditji led India on the road to
development and nation-building. He led India to carve out a place for her
in the world. From the ramparts of this Red Fort, Panditji on numerous
occasions reminded us about the tryst that the Congress had made with
destiny and now after 42 years of Independence we have got an
opportunity to redeem that pledge. Had Panditji been in our midst today he
would have seen how India has built herself up on the foundation that he
laid. I am confident that today's India would have filled Panditji's heart with
pride. This is the year of Panditji's Birth Centenary. If he had an opportunity
to have a look at our progress during the last 42 years, a look at our
farmers, our agricultural labourers, our workers, our women, our children,
our scientists, our youth, our Armed Forces, our industries and our all
round progress, I am sure he would have felt extremely delighted and
proud. But he would have noticed a few drawbacks too. He would have
discovered that despite immense progress and development a few
deficiencies still persist and our tasks remained incomplete. Panditji had
reminded us from this very Red Fort of the words of Gandhiji that so long
as we do not wipe out the tears from the eyes of every Indian, we cannot
rest. Even today, we have not been able to wipe out the tears from every
eye and therefore there is no time to relax. We have a stupendous task and
a long struggle ahead which calls for great sacrifices.
       Panditji very much wanted to fulfil Gandhiji's dream of Gramowaraj.
To achieve this, he started Panchayati Raj. But he could not complete the
task. He could not accomplish this mission because of the infiltration of
power-brokers who did not allow it to succeed. They ensured that real
power did not slip out of their hands into the hands of the people of Bharat.
After introducing Panchayati Raj, Panditji did not live long to fight the
power-brokers to ensure that the power that Gandhiji had wrested from the
British reached the people.
      Indira Gandhi dedicated her entire life to the poor people and the
weaker sections of India. She made every effort for the upliftment of the
downtrodden. She started with bank nationalisation so that the people of
India could have access to capital. Today we are not facing those
problems. We must remember that 20 years ago when the banks were
nationalised, there was almost no branch of any bank in rural India and the
poor people were neither getting any help nor did they derive any benefit
from the capital in the banks.
       Even in Independent India, wealth was only getting circulated among
the affluent people. Indiraji changed the scene by nationalising the banks.
She invested the funds to alleviate poverty and also for the welfare and
upliftment of the poor.
       For the first time, the 20-Point Programme of Indiraji succeeded in
reducing poverty in India. For the first time, we saw that the benefit of big
projects and programmes, started reaching the poor and weaker sections.
Indiraji devoted her entire life for fighting and eliminating the capitalist
forces. If there was anything dearer to Indiraji than poverty-alleviation, it
was the freedom of India and her unity and integrity. Indiraji spared no
effort to ensure that India became stronger. She did not take any step
which would have in any way encouraged any element which would
weaken the country. But Indiraji also had to lay down her life because of
fissiparous forces. It was yet another attempt to disintegrate India just as by
killing Gandhiji an attempt was made to break India.
       I still remember the critical phase through which India passed when
Indiraji was assassinated about five years ago. Dark clouds were hovering
all over the country. There were agitations in different parts threatening to
break the country. After the assassination of Gandhiji, perhaps this was for
the first time that India was facing such a crisis. An agitation was continuing
in Punjab to disintegrate the country. In Tripura, Mizoram and Assam and
in the hills of Darjeeling also certain developments were taking place. In the
South, because of the developments in Sri Lanka some weaknesses were
becoming apparent in our country. Anybody who observed the situation at
that time could not have believed that the country would come out of the
crisis. All that is now, a thing of the past. At that time, in November, the only
aim bring the country back to the path shown by Gandhiji, Panditji and
Indiraji, to realise their dreams and the dreams of the people of India.
     The killers of Indiraji wanted to break India. This conspiracy was not
hatched in our country, but was conceived abroad and thrust upon us. This
conspiracy aimed at breaking and destroying our country. The
assassination of Indiraji was the first step in this direction. The traitors took
Indiraji away from the people of India. Those traitors snatched away my
mother from me. I took a vow that I would not let them succeed in their
aims. let them succeed in their aims. We would not allow anyone to
dismember the country whatever be the price, whatever be the sacrifice we
may have to make. My mother Indiraji had taught me that no sacrifice is too
great for the country. Whatever be the difficulties and whatever be the
sacrifices, we are prepared to make them and are prepared to lay down our
lives. We have to carry forward the struggle started by Gandhiji, Panditji
and Indiraji. We have to carry forward the same movement because
Gandhiji's movement was not only to liberate India. It aimed at ushering in
a new era for the people of the world. Gandhiji showed that it was the only
way to save the world civilisation. Today there is a growing realization in
the world that humanity can be saved only through the path shown to us by
Gandhiji and Panditji who for the first time gave new ideologies to the
world. For the first time, they impressed upon the super powers that the
world cannot move forward and humanity cannot be saved by
power-blocks. They asserted that a new world-vision is required. This
vision is of Ahimsa, Truth, Compassion and Tolerance and above all this is
a vision to view humanity as one entity. This was our strength and that is
how India has emerged as a strong nation. But in pursuit of this ideal we
have had to encounter various forces and face many challenges. At times,
we have faced reactionary forces and even today, this confrontation is
going on as the reactionary forces have not been finished.
       We know how the die-hard elements are active even today in
encroaching upon the rights of women. We can see for ourselves how
these conservative forces, instead of co-operating in the developmental
process of the country, in the service of the people and making the country
strong, and protecting its unity and integrity, are busy in singing and
dancing. India cannot be built in this fashion, and we cannot make it strong
in this manner. Similarly, the forces are still active in weakening and
breaking the country. This is a matter of deep regret. I said earlier that if
Gandhiji, Panditji and Indiraji were alive today they would have been proud
of the progress India had made but some of our deficiencies would have
tormented them. Had they seen that the traitors are moving about freely
and are able to be in our Parliament, had they seen that the traitors could
support the murderers of Indira Gandhi and accept saropas at the citadels
of these murderers, they would have been pained. It would have distressed
them to see how some people amongst us are supporting the resolution
which aimed at weakening and dismembering the country. Gandhiji,
Panditji and Indiraji would have felt distressed to see how the communal
forces are becoming active and how politics is being dominated by
communalism. Perhaps it would have pained them most to see that some
people have deviated from the path shown to us by Gandhiji and are
conducting their politics in a different manner. There are people in our
political life who can say goodbye to principles. This is very sad because
when India gave up, her principled path, we moved towards slavery and
ultimately became slaves. We will be facing the same consequences. We
became strong only because we adhered to principles. But today
unfortunately, opportunism and appeasement are rampant in Indian
politics.
       Very few people are willing to talk about principles. We must
remember that when anti-national, secessionist and communal forces
joined hands in an unprincipled manner, India was divided. We must
remember how this happened. Today, all our energies must be geared up
to defeat the designs of communal, divisive, anti-national, feudal and
conservative forces because if they join together, it would mean the division
of India. The people of India must remember that if they allow these forces
to unite and grow strong, India will disintegrate, her freedom will be lost and
India would again become a slave. Such opportunism would nullify the
struggle which was carried on for years, nay centuries. We will ensure that
these forces do not join together and we will fight to eliminate them. Our
fight would not cease till these forces are banished from India and are
destroyed completely. Whatever may be the challenge, howsoever arduous
be the struggle and whatever may be the sacrifice; no sacrifice can be too
great to protect India from such elements.
      A review of the progress achieved during the last four-five years
would show that India has made significant strides. Even from the point of
view of unity and integrity of the country, the darkness that enveloped the
nation during October-November, 1984 has been dispelled. Today, we see
the bright light of development and India is marching ahead with speed.
       In the intervening period, we had to face severe drought but despite
that the momentum of agriculture in India was sustained and the farmers of
India faced the drought with courage and determination. The workers also
laboured hard to give impetus to industrial development. But the new
emphasis that we laid on the 20-Point Programme of Indiraji, and the
Jawahar Rozgar Yojana that we have launched in the Birth Centenary Year
of Panditji, has also made an impact in removing the poverty and improving
the lot of poor people and weaker sections of India.
       Today, I wish to express my gratitude to the people of India. But for
their hard work this would not have been possible.
      I wish to thank the farmers who have made us self-reliant in the
production of foodgrains. We want to express our gratitude to the workers
and agricultural labourers as it is their toil and hard work that has
industrialised India.
       India has emerged as a new power in the world. I am grateful to the
Jawans of the country who have made sacrifices and have valiantly
protected the unity and integrity of India and maintained peace in the region
during these years. Be it Jawans on the borders or on high snow-clad
mountain peaks, or be it our sailors with the Navy on the sea, be it in the
Maldives to help a neighbouring country or be it in Sri Lanka to protect the
Tamils, the Jawans and the officers of the Indian Forces have raised the
prestige of India and have strengthened India. Similarly, the scientists of
the country have also turned India into a new force by reaching new
frontiers. Be it the test of the Prithvi missile or the launch of Agni, be it
bio-technology for the benefit of farmers or development of new drugs, our
scientists and technologists in different fields have charted new paths to
remove poverty and unemployment and make India stronger.
      I also wish to thank our administration because without an efficient
administration the unity and integrity of the country cannot be so strong,
peace and stability cannot be maintained and India could not have carved
out a place for herself in the world. There may be a few deficiencies and
weaknesses in our administration but there are many strong points without
which India could not be strong and capable of marching on the road
towards development.
       I wish to thank our businessmen and industrialists as they have
accelerated the pace of India's industrialisation. I also want to thank our
public sector which has made its wholehearted contributions to India's
development. I want to specially thank the women of India who have
emerged as a new force during the last few years and have lent a new
strength to India. I want to compliment the youth of India as they have set
out on a new course to eliminate conservatism. For the first time, the youth
will get an opportunity for active participation in India's politics. We have full
faith in the youth of India; they have fought during the freedom struggle and
they have also protected the frontiers of India. Today we have full
confidence that the youth would root out conservatism, feudalism, casteism
and communalism from the soil of India. This would be the real liberation of
the country. I wish to thank the minorities of India who have made
significant contributions in developing and strengthening the country. I am
specially grateful to Harijans and the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled
Tribes; without their moving forward India could not have marched ahead.
Had they not joined together to strengthen the country, it would not have
been possible for us to win freedom and to come out of that dark phase.
       Your contribution has enabled India to stand with her head high in the
in the world. We will demonstrate to the world with dignity that one can
keep India backward. Now India is moving ahead towards development
and progress. During these years we have achieved a lot, yet much
remains to be done. There are several deficiencies. Gandhiji had talked of
Gram Swaraj. Panditji made an attempt to start Panchayati Raj. Today, for
the first time, we are transferring power to the people of India by passing
two Bills in the Lok Sabha. For the first time real Swaraj is being
established. It is your own Raj. In spite of this we find that opposition forces
are creating obstacles. They do not want to strengthen the hands of the
people of India. They do not want that the people of India should decide
their own course of development. The power-brokers, the capitalists, the
conservatives and feudal forces are now coming together. They are joining
hands to prevent the transfer of real power to the people of India. It is sad
that communal forces and traitors also have combined with them. We have
to face all of them because it is only by facing this challenge that we will be
able to strengthen the hands of the people of India, give them social justice
and provide strength to the weaker sections and better their lot. For the first
time we are giving power to the weaker sections, women, Scheduled
Castes and Scheduled Tribes in our polity and democracy by taking special
steps to ensure that criminals and anti-social elements do not infiltrate into
our democracy. For the first time, stern measures have been taken to keep
them away from politics and the democratic process. We will complete this
task despite all the challenges that we may face. After this we have to
undertake at least two major tasks in the coming years. The first relates to
justice.
       Much has been done in India but one cannot honestly claim that
justice is available in villages at the grassroots level. There is so much
delay and expenditure involved that I think we cannot claim that justice is
being done in the real sense. In the coming years we have to
see that justice is done. Just as we are strengthening the Panchayati Raj
institutions to make democracy strong and give impetus to development
and just as we are strengthening the Nagar Palika institutions to provide
resources for the development of urban areas of India, we will also take
steps to ensure that justice is available. If it requires a change in the
structure we are prepared to do that as we are not prepared to deny justice
to the people.
     We have the opportunity before us to give India a new personality in
the world. Today we have an opportunity to make India as great as she
was before her slavery. Before India lost her freedom, people from different
corners of the world came to discover her wealth and to acquire
knowledge. But hundreds of years of slavery have emaciated India. India
degenerated and became poor and weak. Today for the first time, we have
an opportunity to restore India to the same old glorious position. We have
to remove poverty and injustice from India. We have to make India
self-reliant. We have to develop India into a great power in the world but
not like other great powers who have risen by suppressing others. In
pursuance of the ideals of Gandhiji, Panditji and Indiraji, India will not
suppress anyone but would champion the cause of the poor of the world.
India will generate a new spirit that would eliminate groupism and would
establish the supremacy of humanity which would save the civilization and
make it richer. Today we have an opportunity to make India a great nation.
Let us take a pledge to make India great and strong and to take it forward. I
thank you and it is my fervent hope that today on the auspicious occasion
of Independence Day every Indian will place a hand on his or her heart and
take the pledge to make India great and to take it to new heights of glory."
1988,Rajiv Gandhi,INC,Restore India's Glory,"Free rendering of the address in Hindi from the ramparts of the Red Fort on the occasion of Independence Day, New Delhi, 15 August 1988","Rajiv Gandhi, Selected Speeches and Writings, Vol 4",NA,"My congratulations to you on Independence Day today. The monsoon
has been very good this year. I want to congratulate all our farmers, farm
labourers, brothers and sisters, because after many years we have had
such a monsoon.
      On this day, we have to think of the future and also look back. On the
one hand, we have to see where we have to take the country, how we have
to carry our people forward, and on the other hand, we have to ponder over
the difficulties we have emerged out of, and how we can improve things in
future.
       When we look back over the last four years, one thing that we notice
is the economic improvement in the country. We have to recall that the
monsoon was very bad in 1984 and 1985. Then there was drought in 1986
and last year's drought was the worst in living memory. Yet, the country
steadily moved forward.
       Last year, we fought the drought with all our strength. From Delhi,
from the Centre, we paid early attention to it and initiated strong measures.
Our effort was to see that as far as the drought was concerned we should
not bring politics into it and that our attention should be focussed on the
people who were suffering under drought and needed relief. We devoted
last year to this and our entire attention was concentrated on those people.
India came out of this drought and the pace of our development did not
halt, although it slowed down a bit. We did move forward and with strength.
      The world was a witness to how India faced the drought and it
realised that India had become a strong country capable of facing major
calamities. The world also realised that there is nothing that can suppress
India or stop it from forging ahead.
     I want to congratulate all those who put their shoulders to the job of
meeting the challenge of the drought- whether they were in politics,
administration or in any voluntary organisation. Above all, I would like to
congratulate our farmers and farm labourers who faced the drought with
determination. As I said, even though the country was reeling under
drought, its pace of development could not be halted. The country moved
ahead even under those conditions. The performance of our infrastructure
was very good. Likewise, the process of industrialisation continued at a fast
pace and we did not allow it to falter.
      For the first time, the country came out of such a difficult period and
the pace of development did not suffer. For the first time, we did not go to
others with a begging bowl. That we were able to achieve this is a matter of
great pride. We were able to do it because of the work done by Panditji and
Indiraji during the last 40 years- the result of which we see today. Even
while passing through difficult times, there was no slackening of attention
we devoted the poor. We reinforced our programmes of poverty alleviation,
programmes for women, for development of children and for Scheduled
Castes and Scheduled Tribes. We worked for the rapid and effective
implementation of these programmes. Never before have so much of
resources been invested in poverty alleviation programmes as had been
done during these years.
       Even so, sometimes certain painful incidents occur. A few days back,
a major incident occurred in Jehanabad. It brought down the prestige of the
entire country. Our endeavour will be to prevent recurrence of such
incidents. I am aware that our laws have their lacunae and we are unable
to take the kind of action we would like to. If need be, we will change the
laws to ensure that such incidents are not repeated and that the guilty are
swiftly and suitably punished. Similarly, we have to ensure that our
minorities get full opportunity to progress and make their contribution to
nation building. Our weaker sections also require help and we will provide it
to them. We have to ensure that the backward classes in our country are
strengthened and that they get an opportunity to progress.
       Our economic position has become strong and, during these years,
we have also strengthened the country politically. You may recall how the
country was placed three-and-a-half years ago in November 1984. You will
recall that a dark cloud hung over it and the single question that agitated
the hearts and minds of the people was- what will happen to the country;
will India remain united or disintegrate? Indiraji had been assassinated,
there were riots in Delhi, the conditions in Punjab were bad, there w
agitations in Assam and Mizoram, terrorism stalked Tripura and a new
agitation had started in the Darjeeling hills of West Bengal. In the south, the
people were concerned because of the serious Tamil problem in Sri Lanka.
       When we look around us today, we find a great improvement. There
has been an Accord with Sri Lanka which we hope will soon be fully
implemented. Meanwhile, the concern among the people in South India has
been removed. Peace has come to Darjeeling following an agreement.
There has been a settlement in Tripura bringing terrorism to an end. Peace
has been restored in Mizoram and also in Assam. There have been
changes in the Punjab situation though not to the desired extent. When we
compare the Punjab of 1984 with the Punjab of 1988, we see the
difference. The same old feelings are no longer there. Today the
administration is firmly moving ahead together with the people of Punjab
who have stood up firmly for the country and everyone in Punjab is
determinedly facing the challenge of extremism and terrorism.
       We have demonstrated that if we want we can act firmly and show a
firm hand. The Operation ""Black Thunder"" showed to all of us and to the
whole world that India's security forces can act firmly and with great
discipline. It also proved that the terrorists are mere terrorists and that
religion finds no place in their hearts. The kind of things they did in that holy
place, have perhaps never before been indulged in in any sacred place in
the country. We had never witnessed such desecration of a holy place and,
I hope, we never have to see such a thing in future.
      We are taking swift action to secure our borders to prevent infiltration
and control terrorists. We regret that terrorists are still getting help from
across the border. We hope that those helping the terrorists will soon
realise the seriousness of their mistake. We would not like to take any
action that may force them to repent later.
      During these years, we have totally changed the country's spirit. The
depressing dark clouds of 1984 prevail no more. Today, people find a
strong country forging steadily ahead with pride. Today, no one raises the
question of disintegration of the country because India has proved to the
world that it is a power which cannot be weakened by anyone.
       But, there is a weakness which we have to completely eliminate. We
have to destroy the communal forces. We have to ensure that secularism is
strengthened and that no one mixes religion with politics. If a law is
required or any other action is called for, we will do that. But we will fight
the communal forces with all our strength. Our endeavour will be to unite all
those who want to fight communalism and carry them together to fight
these forces. It is our constant endeavour that the spirit of amity among
religions prevailing in India, is not only maintained but strengthened.
       We have also given a great deal of attention to India's security.
Today, our armed forces are stronger than ever before. We are today
capable of facing aggression from any side. This was never the case
earlier. We have provided a great deal of impetus to defence research and
development and to technology and science. For the first time, our defence
technology has forged ahead and is now comparable to that of the
advanced countries. In many areas we are on a level with them and we
hope that in the coming years we will strongly move ahead in this direction
and show to the world that India can fully stand on its own feet and can
totally face any challenge. No one can deviate us from our path.
       On this day, I would like to congratulate my brothers and sisters in the
armed forces for their discipline, their perseverance and for their
determination. It is due to their strength that we sleep peacefully every
night.
      In the same manner, we have taken the prestige of India to great
heights in the world during these years. We desire friendship with all. We
desire that the whole world is enveloped in the spirit of humanism and unity
so that we are able to devote ourselves to poverty alleviation and to
improving the lot of the weaker sections.
      We wish that the ideals of Mahatma Gandhi- the ideals of ahimsa and
tolerance- spread throughout the world. We have made every endeavour to
propagate these principles to every corner of the world. Through the
Non-aligned Movement, we have carried this spirit to 101 nations of the
world. We have moved even farther to carry this spirit even to those
countries which did not subscribe to these principles. These principles have
also made an impact on the great powers. We hope to move ahead on this
path with greater determination and create in the world a new environment
of peace, tolerance, unity of mankind and progress. This was the path
shown to us by Pt. Nehru and by Indiraji. We will not deviate from this path
and will move ahead with determination.
       We desire friendship with all our neighbouring countries. We wish that
all of us co-operate to work for the development of our peoples. We
initiated this co-operation through the SAARC and the movement has
progressed well. There are still many problems and the path is not easy,
but the difficulties are not of our making. We have friendship in our hearts
and we have tolerance. We want our region to be strong, and we will strive
hard to this end.
      In our neighbourhood, a conflict has been going on in Afghanistan.
We are happy that an agreement has been reached and that peace will be
restored there. It is, however. essential that the Agreement reached in
Geneva is implemented and that there is no deviation from it. If the
Agreement fails, it will lead to the weakening of the entire region. We hope
that all the concerned parties will observe the Geneva Agreement.
      There is today only one part of the globe- South Africa- where racial
discrimination is still practised. India, even before Independence, came out
against apartheid, under the leadership of Gandhiji and later under
Jawaharlal Nehru. Even today, we are raising our voice with all our strength
to end apartheid. We will not rest till apartheid is ended, till slavery is
banished from the world.
      Similarly, India is also firmly supporting the Palestinian movement.
We would like an agreement to be reached so that Palestinians find a
home and return to their motherland. We want peace to return to that part
of the world.
     If poverty has to be removed and if weaker nations have to progress,
then it is essential to have nuclear disarmament. No country in the world
has raised its voice in favour of nuclear disarmament as strongly as India.
For the first time, an Action Plan was presented to the United Nations
which would lead to disarmament and peace throughout the world. For the
first time we presented a programme to secure everyone's co-operation.
We hope that nations will soon veer round and accept our plan. We know
that it cannot be achieved quickly. This is not an easy path.
      About 40 years ago, Jawaharlal Nehru had framed a new foreign
policy based on the principles enunciated by Gandhiji. About 30 years ago
Panditji had raised the flag of Non-alignment. Today we find that for the first
time there has been some action on Disarmament and on Non-alignment.
Thirty to thirty-five years after Jawaharlal Nehru had raised the question of
Disarmament, an agreement has been reached on destroying nuclear
weapons. We know that it is not an easy path. Nor will we be able to
complete the course quickly. But we realise that if there has to be peace in
the world and if countries like India have to progress and become strong,
and above all if the poor peoples of the world have to be uplifted, then we
have to cease spending funds on weapons and divert those resources to
eradicate poverty and uplift humanity. We are moving firmly in this direction
and we will not allow any infirmity to creep in.
       India's stock has risen high in the world. The country has earned
recognition and has participated in many major world decisions. We hope
that in the coming years also India will continue to play its role in
world affairs. We will carry the traditional spirit of India to the entire world,
because only then will we be able to carve out the right path and reach the
principles and ideology of Gandhiji to all corners of the world.
       Today, on 15th August, we have to look to the future. We have to
recognise the challenges before the country. There are many challenges
but if I were to list them, I would rate poverty and unemployment as the
main challenges, followed by the task to make our country great and to
take it to the summit of glory where it was before the country was enslaved.
We have to do a lot to remove poverty. We have initiated many
programmes, but a lot more has to be done. If we have to remove poverty
and provide employment, we have first to look at our villages. When we
look at rural India, we have to look at the farmers and farm labourers who
face enormous difficulties. Our effort is that, before anything else, we
should help this sector to progress. If we really have to develop agriculture,
we have to pay serious attention to land reforms. If land reforms are not
implemented particularly in eastern India, the green revolution will not be
able to reach there. We will look at this problem seriously and
try to resolve it.
        We have found that over the years we had the same agricultural plan
for farmers of the plains, for the hills, for desert areas and the south. We
have changed all that. We have divided the country into 15-16 agro-climatic
zones. We are now minutely examining the problems that the farmers face-
what kind of soil they have, what are their irrigation needs, how much
fertiliser and the seeds they require and the crops they should sow. For the
first time we are examining all this minutely. We hope that this year our
agricultural sector makes fast progress. We are making every effort to raise
our level of production and return to the targets we fixed three years ago,
because only then shall we be able to help our farmers and farm labourers.
       We are also faced with another enormous problem. During the last
40-50 years our population has increased tremendously. While a lot of
development has taken place, we find that where three-foul persons
subsisted on a bigha of land, there are 30-40 persons living off the same
land now. Agricultural land has been utilised for constructing roads,
hospitals, schools and other institutions. A lot development has taken place
but in the process land has become scarce. What we have to think about is
how many people can subsist on land. We have also to consider how
others can be provided employment. What is most essential is that
employment has to be provided in the village itself. We have to remove
unemployment and we have to begin with the villages. This is what we are
striving to do. We have to see how value addition to the farmer’s produce
can take place; that the produce is processed, sells better and that the
farmer gets a good price. We have to establish small processing plants.
Our endeavour would be to introduce the produce of Indian farmers to the
whole world and export our fruit, vegetables and foodgrains. We have, in
the Government, given special attention to this. We hope that we will be
able to achieve rapid development especially in the backward and rural
areas.
       At the same time, we have also to ensure faster industrialisation
because without it employment cannot be generated and unemployment
cannot be removed. We have to identify new areas of employment. The
world is changing. A lot of changes have taken place in industry as also in
the life-styles. We have to keep pace with it and to find out new areas of
employment. We have moved fast in this direction also and hope that in the
coming months and years we will find a sea-change in the country, so that
the country gets stronger. Our poor and our youth will find employment and
we will be able to move rapidly ahead.
      There is a great drawback that we have not been able to overcome. I
receive many complaints that our programmes do not fully reach the
grassroots level in rural areas. We have to think why this happens. I had
had many meetings and debated the matter for hours. It then became clear
that unless we made our Panchayati Raj institutions stronger and handed
over responsibility to the people down below, nothing could be achieved.
Gandhiji had said this very clearly. He had said that his concept of Swaraj
did not mean that power should concentrate in the hands of a few. Rather it
meant that the people should have the capability to check misuse of power.
This is what we also want to do. If it requires a change in the law or even
an amendment of the Constitution, we will certainly do it and leave no
lacunae. We will see that power vests in the hands of the people because
we know that this is the only way to ensure the success of our programmes
and to take them to the masses.
      When we look towards the future, our thoughts turn to our nation and
our country. We have to consider what kind of India we would like to make.
We shall remove poverty and we shall eliminate unemployment, but in what
images shall we mould our country? Our endeavour should be to take the
country to the heights to which it belonged about 250-300 years ago,
before people from different corners of the world set out to discover India.
We shall be able to achieve this only when we strengthen the unity and
integrity of India and battle with all those who wish to weaken the country.
India will be strong only when every part of the nation is strong. India will
remain strong only when the Centre remains strong. We will see at no one
is able to weaken the Centre and that the Centre remains strong. We
together carry on our shoulders the country's heritage. All of us are carrying
forward the traditions of Gandhiji, Jawaharlal Nehru and Indiraji. We have
to ensure that we follow their principles and their ideas. At the same time,
we have to remember that it is we who have to find answers to the
problems facing us today. We will not be able to find the answers in history.
We have to carve out our own path with courage and determination. We
have to remember that, if need be, we will have to make sacrifices.
Gandhiji made the sacrifice, Panditji made sacrifices and Indiraji sacrificed
herself. All of us should be ready for whatever sacrifices are to be made. I
am also ready to make sacrifices to make the country strong, to make it go
forward, to take it to the pinnacle and make a place for itself in the world.
     Let all of us pledge today that we will eradicate poverty and
unemployment from the country, make India great and be ready for
whatever sacrifices are required. Today, on 15th August, I pledge from the
ramparts of the Red Fort that together we will restore India to its glory."
1987,Rajiv Gandhi,INC,Forty Years of Independence,"Free rendering of address in Hindi from the ramparts of the Red Fort on the occasion of the Independence Day, Delhi, 15 August 1987","Rajiv Gandhi, Selected Speeches and Writings, Vol 3",NA,"Each anniversary of Independence is sacred to the country. On each
anniversary we remember our freedom fighters. On this day we recall the
builders of modern India. Today, standing on the sacred soil of Red Fort, I
recall 1857, when our first freedom fighters came to this Red Fort. I recall
1945, when soldiers of the Indian National Army were prosecuted here.
Their only crime was that they fought for the freedom of of the motherland.
In 1947 at this very place, Panditji hoisted the flag of Independent India.
Today, when we are assembled here, we remember the ideals, the
principles, the values, and the dreams which inspired our freedom fighters
to win freedom for the country. Today, all of us assembled here rededicate
ourselves to that cause. Jawaharlal Nehru had said, ""If we want to achieve
great things, if we want to build a great India of our dreams, we shall have
to become great ourselves and be worthy children of mother India.""
      On this fortieth anniversary, we naturally think not only of the events
of the last one year but of the last 40 years. At the same time we look
forward to the future as well.
     Our elders got us freedom and entrusted us with the responsibility of
safeguarding and maintaining that freedom. It is our responsibility to protect
it.
        During these four decades we faced many situations, a number of
threats and also pressures. We faced conspiracies, we faced aggressions.
We did not bend, we protected the unity and integrity of India with our
courage, our blood and our sacrifices. We showed to the world that India is
strong, India is one and it cannot be divided. We demonstrated to the world
that no one can enslave us again. We made it clear that nobody can
weaken the unity of India. We made it evident that no sacrifice is too big for
the security of our country, the independence of our country and the unity
of our country. No amount of labour, no amount of sacrifice is too high a
price to pay of this purpose. Our soldiers, our officers give the best years of
their lives to guard our frontiers and to defend us. In return we look after
them, we provide them with the best of weaponry and ammunition. We see
to it that they get the best tools they need. We are pledged to do so. The
freedom of India means the freedom of the people of India. The freedom of
India means that we should strengthen the roots of democracy, and hold
impartial elections in which every citizen can participate. We conduct
Parliament in such a way that the voice of the people of India is listened to.
It looks after and builds the future of the country. The meaning of free India
is that it has an independent judiciary and rule of law. Free India means
that it has a free and unfettered press. But it is not so easy to protect
democracy, especially when we find that there are people who endanger
our freedom through irresponsibility and indiscipline, who show disrespect
to the Constitution and its institutions through their behaviour. Still we have
demonstrated that the roots of democracy in our country are deep, Our
people must remain alert. It is only a Government based on democracy that
can function in a country like India.
       Our great economic achievements have been acclaimed all over the
world. Gandhiji had taught us that the process of development and the task
of building the country should begin with the people by eradicating poverty.
He taught us that the moral duties should be kept in the forefront in our
national life.
      We have taken the country forward towards these very objectives.
Eradication of poverty has been given the highest priority. We have used
our entire energy in eradicating poverty. Indiraji gave a call for eradicating
poverty. She brought about a new awakening in the country as a result of
which there was reduction in poverty. Because of her 20-Point Programme
and other programmes for rural development, be it NREP or IRDP or any
other, there has been improvement in the lives of the poor people of the
country. We see that the picture has changed during the last 40 years.
Forty years ago two-third of India's population was below the poverty line.
Today two-third of the population has come above the poverty line.
      This achievement is due to our anti-poverty programmes. They have
also smashed the hold of feudalism. Eradication of poverty has been
carried forward through the Green Revolution. As a result, in just a few
years' time our production of foodgrains tripled. I remember the time when
there was drought 21 years ago, and Indiraji had to seek foodgrains from
foreign countries. How small she felt when she had to bow down to others
for foodgrains. It was then that she decided that never again would India
appeal to foreign countries for foodgrains. She overruled her technocrats
and her other advisers and took steps which brought about the Green
Revolution in the North-Western part of the country. Indiraji’s foresight and
her determination coupled with the sweat and hard work of farmers of India,
produced these desired results. Today we can say with pride that India will
never go to others for food.
       Similarly, at the time of independence, our manufactures were
restricted to a few simple things. Today, with the development that has
taken place during the last 40 years, our industries have progressed to
such an extent that India can manufacture products comparable with those
of advanced countries. We have today reached a stage from where we can
leap forward with greater energy and compete with others. Our scientists
have shown to the world that they are capable of achieving the highest in
the field of science. Our technocrats have proved that they can master all
types of technology successfully. The path ahead is long but none can say
that we have not traversed far enough during the last 40 years. We are
building the India of our future on the foundations of development that have
been soundly laid during these 40 years. We shall see to it that our
industries grow and expand rapidly. We shall see to it that our youth get
new and more opportunities of employment. We have to see that our
productivity rises, prices go down and quality improves. It should be our
effort to associate our workers in the public sector units with management.
We should ensure that our science and technology are not borrowed from
foreign countries but develop in a way that benefits the country and also
the poor people of the country. They should be able to meet our demands
and requirements. We also have to see that they go ahead and see the
work done in other parts of the world, meet the challenges and show the
way to the world. The most important thing, however, is that we should not
allow our attention to be diverted. Our attention must be concentrated all
the time on the poorest and the weakest person.
       In the field of agriculture, production has increased a great deal, it
has reached 15 crore tonnes. But we find that it is stagnating at 15 crore
tonnes for the last three years. It is true that the monsoon has not been
good during these years. Farmers in many regions and parts of the country
have to face difficulties but we are resolved to ensure that the farmers'
produce is not affected by the vagaries of weather in future. We have to
take steps to ensure increase in agricultural production in spite of adverse
weather. Some 70 percent of our population reside in rural areas, and
almost the same percentage of people are poor and they earn their
livelihood in the agricultural farms. The number of agricultural labourers is
much more than that of farmers. We have to pay special attention towards
them. If we want to eradicate poverty we have to begin with the farmers’
fields. We have started spreading the Green Revolution and we are happy
to see that during the last two years, an improvement has been noticed for
the first time in Uttar Pradesh. Improvement has also been noticed in Bihar,
Orissa and Bengal where the output of farmers is increasing. Poverty has
been reduced in the rural areas. At the same time we have to pay special
attention to the production of cotton, oilseeds and pulses. In this way we
will see that with the spread of greenery poverty would be gradually
reduced and would ultimately vanish.
      This year we have provided more resources than ever before for
programmes meant for the eradication of poverty. At the same time we
have strengthened the administration as part of the poverty eradication
programme. I have myself travelled far and wide, and after seeing the work
with my own eyes and discussing the matter with the officers, strengthened
these programmes and intensified them. Most important of all we have
treated education as a part the poverty eradication programme because as
long as the children of the poor people do not get good education, poverty
cannot be eradicated.
      Today, however, we find another problem before us, a very serious
problem, that is of unemployment of the youth. We find signs of pessimism
in our youth. Millions of our young people do not succeed in getting
employment and millions remain dissatisfied even after getting employment
because they do not get what they want. We have to concentrate on the
employment scene. There are some weaknesses and deficiencies in our
set-up. There is employment, there are jobs, but the education, the skills
that are required to fill up the vacancies are not there. Millions of boys and
girls are matriculates, millions of them are degree holders but all cannot get
white-collar jobs. We have taken care of these things in our new education
policy. It has been our endeavour to make up the deficiency in our set-up.
Through this policy we will ensure that the boys and girls coming out of
schools and colleges, get such education which provides them
employment. At the same time we will have to see that the rural
employment programmes and other developmental programmes are
implemented in such a way that the maximum number of people get jobs.
But this will be possible only when we make a rapid progress in all fields-
agriculture, industry, infrastructure and services. Most important, perhaps,
is the fact that we should succeed in the matter of self-employment. It is not
so difficult to give jobs to all if we work with determination, if we examine
things properly and if we see to it that our education matches the required
skills. If we increase the pace of progress, bring maximum number of
young people to the technical trades and inspire them to start small
enterprises, place maximum number of people in services, then that
objective can be achieved. We have to see that all people do not aspire for
just government jobs; they should also go elsewhere. This can reduce
unemployment and we are determined to eliminate unemployment. We
shall place programmes before the country in the coming years to ensure
that unemployment is eradicated.
      This year we are facing a difficult situation because of drought. Such
a widespread drought has not been experienced for many years. We had
faced a drought in 1965-66, that was grave but was grave but was confined
to one or two regions. This year's drought has affected virtually all parts of
the country. However, thanks to Indiraji's far-sightedness which increased
the production of our farmers; our economy today is quite strong and we
can face the drought. There will be no shortage. No doubt there is drought,
but we can face it today because of the Green Revolution brought about by
Indiraji. In many States this is the third or fourth year of drought. The poor
are facing great hardships. Their basic needs are uppermost in our minds.
Our minds also go out to the landless people and the marginal farmers who
have been rendered unemployed and who are not getting any work today.
In many States there is scarcity of drinking water as well. In many States
there is shortage of fodder for the cattle.
       We will face the situation with all our might. As the head of the
Government, I pledge that we will concentrate all our attention and accord
the highest priority to deal with this drought situation. We will see to it that
we are able to reach foodgrains to every nook and corner of rural India
from our granaries. We will ensure that enough employment is provided to
the poor people through relief works. We will also ensure that employment
is provided to all those who really need it. We will see to it that there is no
dearth of food. Nobody will have to go hungry. We will strengthen our
public distribution system so that foodgrains reach all parts of the country,
at the doorsteps of the people, especially in the rural areas so that people
do not have to go far, for food. We will ensure that there is no scarcity of
drinking water. We shall also pay special attention to the problem of fodder
scarcity so that our cattle wealth and animals are also able to face this
difficult situation.
       We have to make a large collective effort to deal with this drought
situation. At the Centre, as also in the States, we will see to it that all
required assistance is provided by us. At the same time it is also to be seen
that the State Governments act firmly and with speed because it is they
who reach down to the villages. We will give all assistance but the State
Governments will have to move fast. I have written to the Chief Ministers of
States which are facing the drought situation. I shall call a meeting of the
Chief Ministers in which we shall discuss and decide how the drought
situation can be met collectively, and identify steps which are necessary to
save the poor people from difficulty. A great deal remains to be done. But
since the country is strong, we will accomplish the job and successfully
face this challenge.
       It is, however, necessary that we devote our full attention and energy
to this problem. Our granaries are full. We have the experience and
capacity today. We can face this challenge of starvation without any foreign
assistance, but we must be clear that it is not necessary to slow down the
pace of development in order to deal with the drought situation. By stalling
development, by suspending development, we will have to face a greater
crisis in the days to come. We have to find resources so that without
reducing or slowing the pace of development we can face the present
challenge. There is need for economy, austerity; it is necessary to reduce
or eliminate non-essential expenditure. We have already advised each
Ministry to start taking such steps. The State Governments should also
take similar steps. The Government will do whatever it can, but it cannot
deal with such a drought situation alone. In such a situation, it is necessary
for the people to meet this challenge together with the Government. The
young people especially should come forward to face this challenge hand
in hand with the Government and others. We have to see that each man
and woman and individual and each community as a social group will join
hands with the Government to face this grave situation. We should build up
such a movement that reaches all parts of the country.
       This is the time when more fortunate people should come to the
rescue of the less fortunate ones. We have to see that no anti-social
element takes advantage of this situation to earn money and exploit the
miseries of the poor people. We will have to deal firmly with such elements.
Hoarding will have to be stopped, profiteering will have to be eliminated. If
we face the anti-social elements resolutely we will be able to keep the
situation under control. We will not spare any effort. With all the might of
the Government, we will see to it that the anti-social elements are kept
under control. Any lacuna in the law that may come in the way of dealing
with such people, will be removed, and the Government will acquire the
powers necessary for dealing with them, but I appeal to all to co-operate
fully in constructive co-operation from every quarter- from legislators, from
Members of Parliament, from the Opposition, from experts, and from the
press. In the context of this challenge, it is necessary to forge a national
effort to meet the situation effectively.
       India has made remarkable social progress during the last 40 years.
We find that casteism has decreased during these years. Our women have
become stronger. We have provided more opportunities to our girls to go to
schools and colleges. We have specially encouraged them to go to
schools. Last year, we consolidated further the anti-dowry law to strengthen
the hands of women and we find that since then the number of girls killed
because of dowry problem has gone down. We hope to further increase the
strength of our women. We also have to pay attention towards our
labourers and their problems. During the last two years, we have passed a
legislation to prevent child labour. This law prohibits all employment of
children in hazardous industries. The legislation provides for the education
of children and also takes care of their food and health. The problem of
agricultural labourers had been attended to during the past 40 years. We
have set up a National Commission to study the problems of agricultural
labourers and suggest programmes to deal with their problems.
      The tribal people have their own problems, I have myself visited
those districts, the villages and also their huts to have an idea of their
problems and the way government programmes are being implemented,
where these programmes need to be strengthened and where there is
need for assistance. We have paid special attention to the problems of our
Harijan brothers. We will see to it that the hands of the Commissioner of
Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes are so strengthened that he is
able to deal firmly with the situation wherever the Harijans and the tribal
people have not been given their due.
       We will see to it that the legislation intended to uplift the Harijans and
the tribal people are strengthened, the provisions are effectively
implemented, and nobody is able to stall this work. We have implemented
very effectively the 15-Point directive of Smt. Indira Gandhi relating to the
minority communities.
       The middle class population has increased in the country because of
increase in economic opportunities. A large number of people now go to
different parts of the country to find employment. More and more people
are now undertaking journeys in the country. People from one part of the
country are going to other parts in search of jobs; they are getting
employment outside their homes, their villages, their districts and
sometimes even outside their respective States. This consolidates the unity
of the country as such people are able to see the vastness of the country.
The unity and integrity of the country is strengthened through these people.
We have achieved a lot during the last 40 years but even then, in spite of
the social progress, a lot still remains to be done.
      Some of the problems are old and many new ones have cropped up.
Communal feelings have come to the fore in some places. We see the
misuse of religious places. The religious feelings of the people are being
toyed with. We find one community fighting with another community, a
brother fighting with his brother, a man fighting with another man; all these
cause danger to our secularism.
      Communalism and Sectarian forces were causing harm to the unity
and integrity of the country during the days of the freedom struggle. We
had fought on the basis of concepts denouncing communalism. Even
today, there is no room for communalism in India. India is an ancient
country inhabited by people believing in different faiths since centuries,
People belonging to all religions and all thoughts have resided here since
times immemorial. We have seen that people of all traditions and all faiths
have lived like brothers in our society. There is no room at all for
communalism in our society, our democracy. We have to face this
challenge. It is the duty of every citizen to ensure this by all his actions and
thinking, He should maintain cordiality in the society. A majority of the
people who are deeply religious believe in true religion, and are secular
and they should come forward and face those few people who weaken the
country, who believe in sectarianism, who believe in fundamentalism, who
believe in violence and who believe in looting and terrorism. There is no
place in India for those people who try to weaken the country in the name
of religion. People of different communities have lived in this country for
centuries, peacefully working together, playing together and participating
constructively in each others lives. Sometimes, however, hatred raises its
head all of a sudden and things are on fire and there is terror.
       Generally, outsiders are responsible for this and sometimes because
of religious leaders. These people weaken us by spreading rumours,
creating misunderstanding and spreading falsehood.
       Normally, innocent people fall victim to such conspiracies. Whenever
such sectarian conflicts come to the fore, maximum harm is caused to the
innocent people/ They are the worst sufferers. Our war on sectarian forces
cannot, however, be fought only through the machinery of law. This should
be a people’s war. It must be fought in every locality, in every area. We
have to ensure that all of us are one in this war against dangerous
criminals, and stop the misuse of religion, and eliminate the people
spreading hatred. Those who are sowing the seeds of hatred among us
must be crushed. We must face such people who are out to destroy our
society. Communalism gives rise to separatism. Communalism produces
terrorism and efforts are being made to eliminate our democracy through
communalism, separatism and terrorism.
      We notice all sorts of methods are being employed to weaken our
country and to disturb peace in our country. Efforts are being made to
create ill-feelings among the tolerant and peaceful people of this country.
We do not have to submit to separatists; we have to face them. We will
face all of them with all our might. We will face those who try to weaken our
freedom, our security and our future through threats, pressurisation and
causing infights. We will not allow them to rise. We will not stop till terrorism
is completely eliminated or till the terrorists do not return to the country's
mainstream giving up their arms. We do not have to give up our courage,
we do not have to be fearful. Gandhiji has said, ""Independence means
fearlessness against death. A nation afraid of death cannot become free
and if it attains freedom it cannot protect it.""
      The words of Gandhiji should resound in our ears today and we must
face this challenge boldly. We must remember that we will not counter
them for taking revenge. If we try to take revenge, then it will only serve the
designs of the terrorists. Revenge would only bring victory to terrorism. If
we use restraint, terrorism will weaken and will ultimately be defeated. We
must not fall into the trap of terrorism. Gandhiji has said that violence
cannot be an answer to violence. Only non-violence can be the answer.
India holds its head high in the world today. The voice of India is heard in
the world with respect. Why? How is it that a country which was a slave,
poor till 40 years ago, and about which people used to think that it would
never stand on its own and could not safeguard its freedom, now speaks
out in such a strong voice? It has been possible, because we moved
forward taking with us the concepts of Gandhiji, principles of Panditji and
the path shown by Indiraji.
      We have learnt to speak fearlessly, we have learnt not to submit
under pressures, we have learnt to move forward on the path of
non-violence with courage and facing the challenges boldly. We launched a
movement against the atomic weapons in the world during the last 40
years. Today many powerful countries are attracted towards it. The feeling
that Gandhiji and Panditji had brought to the fore before our Independence,
is now spreading throughout the world after 40 or 50 years. It is just
insanity that we continue to manufacture weapons while the available
weapons alone can extinguish the entire world 50 times. It is really
madness that 15 to 20 million rupees are spent every minute in the world
on arms race. Even a small fraction of it can be of great help in eradicating
poverty, disease and unemployment. India is paying attention to these
things. We are paying attention to human rights and human dignity.
       South Africa, where Gandhiji had started his first satyagraha, is still
reeling under slavery. The flag of freedom has not still been unfurled there.
It is shameful that 100 years have passed, hundreds and thousands of
freedom fighters have offered sacrifices including their lives, but the place
from where the flame of freedom rose is still under slavery. We have raised
the question of poor people in the world. We have taken up the cause of
suppressed sections of the world. We have demonstrated that our voice is
that of balance tolerance, compassion, truth and non-violence.
       Last month we signed an agreement in Sri Lanka- an agreement that
proved the correctness of our policy, which demonstrated that the impact of
our foreign policy is good and that India was moving on the right path. This
is an important achievement in these 40 years. The latest agreement that
we have reached and signed has brought peace and co-operation in Sri
Lanka. This has strengthened the cause of peace and co-operation in the
entire region. We have checked the activities of those who were
endangering the security of the entire region and have prevented rivalries
of the power blocs reaching our neighbourhood. This has strengthened the
cause of non-alignment. It has been proved that countries can solve their
problems through dialogue without allowing the big powers or other
sections or parties to come in. We have seen that whenever outsiders
interfere, the problems become more serious and difficult. Today, on the
40th anniversary of our Independence, we have to re-dedicate ourselves to
these ideas and concepts.
        Our greatest asset is the system given to us by our forefathers. We
have seen that the system is in tune with our ancient traditions and our
culture, which have flourished uninterrupted for thousands of years. We
used that spirit in our struggle for freedom and should use it in building a
new India. Today, our greatest attainment is our democracy. We have to
safeguard it, consolidate it. No weakness should be allowed to permeate it.
Still, we find that certain elements are trying to weaken it in a bid to
eliminate it. This system has existed for the last 40 years, and we have
found that under it India has gained in strength, it has remained one, it has
progressed and has been able to face the world. If some people for their
own petty political development want to disrupt the faith of the people and
harm our democracy just for their own development and benefit, we must
stand up to them. We have to see to it that they do not gain in strength. We
have to ensure that they are not able to divert the attention of the country.
We must also see that they do not succeed in conspiring internally or from
outside to weaken the country. It is true that a few things are not well in our
society and our system. We will see to it that the people who are doing
wrong things are dealt with promptly and firmly and are punished. Our
concentration today should, however, be on national reconstruction and not
on rumours. We must pay attention to national reconstruction and take the
country on the path of progress. We should correct the flaws in our system
and promote such policies which will further strengthen our society and the
system. We are doing so and we are trying to move on the path of
progress. We would like to see that all sections of the people, especially
the youth, start a national campaign against complacency, sectarianism
and corruption. We have to abide by the principles which Gandhiji placed
before us. We must safeguard our freedom. We must strengthen our
society. It should be our endeavour to see that people belonging to all
sections of our society work for the welfare of the poor and the weak, and
maintain communal and religious harmony. We must ensure that Harijans,
tribals and women progress in all respects in our society and consolidate
their position. We have to be guided by Gandhiji's principles of truth,
non-violence and human unity.
       At the same time, we have to ensure that we remain self-reliant. We
must remember that only right means can ensure the right end. Gandhiji's
message was not meant for his generation alone. It was for all the future
generations. This message is as important for the reconstruction and
consolidation of the country as it was for the achievement of our freedom. It
is also of importance in the context of making the world stronger.
       Today, I congratulate all my 78 crore brothers and sisters residing in
different parts and remote areas of this peaceful country, in this our India -
yours and mine - of those who are rich, who are poor, young and the old,
people belonging to all religions, people belonging to different communities,
people belonging to all States, people speaking different languages, and
people having different cultures. Our unity is sound, our integrity is eternal.
We take inspiration from the past, to move confidently into the future. It is
our firm resolve that we will unitedly move ahead on the path of progress to
safeguard our freedom, our democracy, our secularism, our socialism, our
security and our non-alignment, stage by stage, and make India really
great."
1986,Rajiv Gandhi,INC,Make India a Land of Peace and Prosperity,"Free rendering of Independence Day speech in Hindi from the ramparts of the Red Fort, 15 August 1986","Rajiv Gandhi, Selected Speeches and Writings, Vol 2",NA,"We are gathered here today at the Red Fort for the fortieth time. This
Fort is a symbol of India's glory. It is a symbol of India's strength. It was
from here that the first call for Independence was given in 1857. It was here
that Shah Nawaz, Dhillon and Sehgal, followers of Subhas Chandra Bose,
stood trial. There can be no greater sacrifice for the love of the country than
theirs. It was here that the British flag was lowered and the Indian tricolour
first unfurled by Panditji. This flag, so dear to our hearts, commands our
deepest respect. Under this flag we fight for the nation's security and
progress. All of us are the children of Mother India. We will make India a
land of peace, a land of prosperity. As we celebrate Independence Day,
what do we understand by independence? What does freedom which we
achieved on this day, mean to us? Does independence mean freedom of
the people, or do we also think of our land, our forests and the whole
environment? Do we also think of development and progress of our
country? Yes, all these form part of freedom which has a deeper, more
fundamental meaning. We cannot forget our ancient culture, our values and
there cannot be any deviation from our principles. We have to follow
traditions and maintain our heritage.
       What are these values? The foremost is the principle of nationalism.
The idea of nationhood is not new for India; it has been deeply embedded
in the hearts and minds of the people of India for thousands of years.
Nobody has been able to dislodge it. Whether we had political unity or we
were under foreign rule, nobody was able to erase the feeling of Indianness
which was always deep in our hearts. Today's free India- a glorious,
self-reliant nation committed to its ideals of unity and integrity- is the
manifestation of this sense of nationalism.
       If India is strong every Indian is strong; if India is weak every Indian
will be weak. Our endeavour has always been to make the people of India
strong and the future of the country secure. In our strength lies our honour,
our progress. Being an Indian does not mean that we are mere inhabitants
of this country. It means that we are inheritors of a splendid civilization of
over five thousand years. We have a diversity of cultures. We belong to
different religions- Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Christians, Jains, Parsis,
Buddhists. We speak a variety of languages. Our tolerance makes all of
them flourish. We accord equal respect to all faiths and religions. Our
strength and unity flow from this fact. This is the only path we must follow,
for our strength lies in our diversity.
      Independence meant the opportunity to govern the country in
accordance with our wishes. Like us, many other nations attained freedom,
but in very few of them do we find the people the real masters, as in India.
India has vouchsafed to its citizens all human rights. If we also look at other
nations, we can see how many nations have been able to follow the same
path as India and who have been able to give the same kind of freedom
and rights which we have given to our people and who have been able to
preserve their democracy. In India, the government is in the hands of the
people. The people can change a government whenever they so desire.
They shape their destiny.
     In India free elections have been held in a democratic set-up. We
have a free Press and we have laws under which all citizens are equal. We
have taken up democratic development. We aim at self-reliance: We
remain non-aligned in foreign policy. Our path comprises all these three
aspects.
      We have only to recall the situation during British rule to realise the
progress that India has made. During British rule, deaths from hunger and
famine were common. Just before Independence, 30 lakh people died in
the Bengal famine. During 50 years from 1900 to 1950, our agricultural
output remained static. But from 1950 to 1985 the output increased
threefold. Wheat production increased sevenfold and that of paddy fivefold.
On this occasion, I would like to extend my congratulations to the farmers
of India, for it is due to their hard work that we are independent today.
      In public health before Independence, the infant mortality rate was
very high. We introduced a vigorous health programme under which
thousands of primary health centres were set up. We have eradicated
smallpox and controlled malaria. The life expectancy of our people has
virtually doubled and it is over 56 years now. I should like to congratulate
our doctors and nurses and others who have made this possible.
      Likewise, in the field of education, almost every village has a school
today. The education policy which had outlived its relevance and with which
we were no longer happy has been changed. We have formulated a new
education policy which will provide India a new path leading to strength,
unity and self-reliance.
       A vast network of roads has been provided to villages. Drinking water
is now available in most rural and tribal areas and it will be our endeavour
to see that by the end of the Seventh Plan there is no village left in the
country without drinking water facility. Industrialisation has provided
employment to crores of people. We can see that India has shaken off its
backwardness and emerged as a progressive and dynamic nation.
Industrial production has gone a long way to improve the quality of their
lives, and put the country on the path of progress and prosperity.
       Our scientists and technologists have today brought India at par with
the developed countries of the world in many fields. We do not think of
science and technology for its own sake, but for the common man, the poor
and the backward. When we talk of science and technology our objective is
to bring it within the reach of the poor people in our villages. Today, when
we look into the future and visualise the India of the 21st century, we see
before us a strong, self-reliant, self-confident and economically sound
nation. This will be achieved through our emphasis on self-reliance, by
maintaining our dignity and our honour, by seeing to it that our flag flies
high and we move in the world with our head held high. We have been
following this path in the past and we will continue to do so in future also.
We have taken care that India does not sink into the debt trap. Other
nations have got bogged down in heavy debts in the pursuit of
development. We have ensured that India does not give in to the pressures
of multinationals. This is the only way to our progress and strength. We will
not swerve from this path of progress.
      Of paramount importance to us is the welfare of the poor, the
deprived and the backward. With all our might, we are endeavouring to
better their lot and remove poverty through our anti-poverty programmes,
through 20-Point Programme and through our agricultural development
programmes. Agricultural development is the main plank for removal of
poverty, because of the dominance of agriculture in our economy. During
the last five we have succeeded in bringing nearly 10 crore people above
the poverty line through these programmes. We hope that by the end of the
Seventh Plan, we will be able to lift three quarters of the country's
population above the poverty line. Our effort is to wipe out poverty from the
country.
      I propose to place shortly before the nation a revised 20-Point
Programme. We have modified and improved the current 20-Point
Programme. Such of these programmes which have been completed and
have fulfilled their objectives are being dropped and new ones are being
introduced. We will ensure greater employment opportunities under the
revised 20-Point Programme.
       During the last one year, I have toured the country extensively. I
made it a point to visit the most backward and most poverty-stricken areas,
among which are tribal areas. I have talked to the poorest of the poor. I
have spoken to villagers, to farmers in their homes, in their huts, in their
fields. I have met them at places where relief work was in progress. I have
shared their difficulties, their miseries. At the same time, I have seen their
success, hopes, tolerance, inner strength, perseverance, hard work and
struggle. I have seen how bravely they were facing their problems and
difficulties and how they were fighting the vested interests, the landlords,
the zamindars and the bureaucracy. I am with the country's poor, the
oppressed and the weaker sections of our society. We are committed to
their uplift.
       Among the backward and oppressed people are the poor Harijans,
the tribals and our womenfolk, who perhaps form the largest oppressed
section of our society. We must ensure that all kinds of discrimination
against them is removed and for this, I can assure you, we shall take all the
necessary steps. We may have to change our policies, modify our
programmes and strengthen our laws for the uplift of the Harijans, tribals
and women. It will be our endeavour to see that our womenfolk receive
greater respect, equal rights and economic independence.
       At the same time, we cannot afford to lose sight of our ancient
philosophical heritage which teaches us that development does not come
about only through acquisition of wealth. Accumulation of wealth generates
greed and selfishness. It causes more dissatisfaction and leads to misery.
Therefore, while we pursue development, we must lay stress on moral
values. We have to see that our cultural heritage, the age-old values which
have sustained us down the years and kept us united, are maintained and
preserved. Since Independence we have made tremendous progress. The
signs of progress are visible in all fields. But we have to look into the future
also and ensure that it becomes brighter. There is one serious threat to it
and that is communalism. It is a matter of shame and a disservice to the
nation that people are being killed, houses burnt and shops looted. We
cannot afford to let this happen and we will not let it happen. Any kind of
violence is wrong, but the worst kind of violence is that which takes place in
the name of religion. This, in fact, is a fraud on religion. True religion stands
for love and tolerance, love for all fellow beings and respect for all faiths.
Different religions are only different paths leading to the same destination.
God is reached through many paths. We also see that the snake of
fundamentalism is raising its ugly head in our country. Fundamentalism
leads to hatred and violence, The Government will take steps to wipe it out,
and if it requires the use of force we will not hesitate to do so. We will not
allow communalism and violence to spread, we will eliminate them from our
society.
      Last year when I was speaking to you from here, we had signed the
Punjab accord. A dialogue followed and we covered a lot of ground.
Elections were held in Punjab and a popular government took office once
again and democracy was restored. Because of the accord we have been
able to fight terrorism and extremism in Punjab. Side by side, we have
taken steps to improve the training of the police and to ensure that they get
the best possible equipment. We have seen to it that they get the best
possible equipment. We have seen to it that there are no shortcomings in
this sphere. The situation today is that the extremists are on the run and a
large number of them are being apprehended or killed. During the last few
weeks many extremists have been captured. This objective will be pursued
more vigorously. I am sure that over the next few months we will be able to
tackle terrorism and wipe out the terrorists completely. This will have to
happen soon, for we cannot permit this to go on for long. But what is
happening is that whenever we meet with some success in tackling this
problem, there is a corresponding frustration among them and then they try
to build up their confidence by doing something drastic. For instance last
year we saw the assassination of Sant Longowal. This year they have killed
General Vaidya. Both these incidents have caused us great grief. The
terrorists resorted to these killings when they found that they were being
arrested, uprooted and eliminated and the public was turning against them.
       Now that the pressure is on the extremists, it is possible that they
may resort to some further killings to shake the confidence of the people or
to provoke reprisals from the people. But we will remain calm in the face of
such provocation. We will see to it that no innocent person is harmed. We
will not fall into their trap. I am sure the people will not fall prey to the
terrorists' designs. We will have our own strategy and finish them. We will
see that every measure that is called for to wipe out the terrorists is taken.
We will not be found lacking in the use of force, police action, political will
and dedication. This calls for a lot of moral courage and removal a number
of misconceptions. It is strange that violence and arson take place in the
name of religion, in the name of saints and gurus. While there is no doubt
that the full might of the Government is called for to tackle the question of
extremism, it is essential that the people also extend their conscious
support and take a firm stand against this menace. If we want to fight
extremism, we can do so if all the 75 crore Indians stand together. We can
face extremism unitedly in keeping with the traditions of non-violence.
Gandhiji said that the philosophy of non-violence is not merely for sants
and rishis but it is also a faith to be followed by the common man.
Non-violence makes the people strong. Gandhiji taught us that violence
and intolerance expose our weaknesses. He proved that hatred and
intolerance should not be countered with hatred and intolerance. He
showed us the path of peace and non-violence. We can fight terrorism only
through peace and non-violence. And we will triumph over terrorism
through this path of tolerance and communal harmony. We have to see that
the people unite irrespective of their religion, caste and language and fight
this war against terrorism just as they fought for Independence.
        If India has to progress then we have to look not only inward but
outward also, across our frontiers, at the outside world. The world today is
faced with a great danger- a danger that threatens to destroy this planet,
threatens to impede the progress of India. If India has to become strong,
and if we have to ensure regional security in our part of the world, then
there is only one way to accomplish this. War will know no frontiers and it
will not be confined within the borders of the warring countries. It can
destroy the whole world, can annihilate the entire mankind. It is our effort to
put a stop to the mad race for nuclear weapons. There is only one way and
that is disarmament. It is only when nuclear weapons are destroyed that
the farmers and the people of India can be assured of security. Our stand
on the question of disarmament is very clear and eloquent- for peace, for
the future of the world and for the future of mankind. Our foreign policy
gives us strength. We have remained independent and contributed to world
peace. If we have to follow the path of progress and development, world
peace is essential. In the international forums India's voice is heard loud
and clear. The voice of India is the voice of the 75 crores of its people. In
this lies our strength.
     Today we command respect in the comity of nations because we
have followed the path of non-alignment and self-reliance. We speak with
courage, conviction and confidence.
      In a sense non-alignment is international democracy. It does not pose
any threat to our independence. The concept of non-alignment was given
to the world by Panditji. Indiraji carried the torch forward. The Non-aligned
Movement which began in a small way has a membership of 101 countries
today. Today, two-thirds of the countries in the world speak the voice of the
non-alignment. During the last few years, India was the Chairperson of the
Non-aligned Movement. We were faced with many problems- the problem
of Grenada, the Libyan issue, apartheid and the flouting of international
laws by the bigger countries. The world passed through a difficult phase,
but under India's leadership the Non-aligned Movement gained strength
and contributed to world peace.
        On the occasion of Independence Day today, I extend my warm
felicitations to all my countrymen. My special, greetings to the members of
our armed forces, to those who are guarding our frontiers whether in the
desert, on the high mountains or in the dense forests. It is because of their
sacrifices that India has been able to preserve her freedom again and
again.
        As I stand here I see before me temples, mosques, gurudwaras and
churches. This is the real wealth of India and this is where our real strength
lies. As I stand here my mind goes to Gandhiji and Panditji. I also think of
Maulana Azad, Sardar Patel, Rajendra Babu, Rajaji, Subhas Chandra
Bose, Shastriji and Indiraji. Indiraji stood here at this very spot at the Red
Fort sixteen times. She fought for India's poor and the backward throughout
her life. She fought for India's unity and integrity and laid down her life for it.
The responsibility of fulfilling her tasks lies on our shoulders and we will
fulfil her dreams in every way. Let us dedicate ourselves to preserving and
safeguarding our independence, democracy, secularism, socialism and the
unity, integrity and honour of the country."
1985,Rajiv Gandhi,INC,Let Us Strengthen India,"Free rendering of Independence Day speech in Hindi from the ramparts of Red Fort, 15 August 1985","Rajiv Gandhi, Selected Speeches and Writings, Vol 1",NA,"We are today celebrating the thirty-eighth anniversary of India's
Independence. On this occasion, I extend my greetings to all citizens, in
every village and town, to our farmers and workers, to our mothers and
sisters, to the children of India, to menfolk, to our armed forces and to all
Indians living abroad.
       Thirty-eight years ago, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru for the first time
unfurled the tricolour at this very Red Fort. Indiraji should have been here
today but she has been snatched away from us. The task has fallen on me.
I did not see the struggle for Independence. When the tricolour was
unfurled here for the first time, I was only three years old. Today, two-thirds
of the people of India are like me, who have not participated in the country's
struggle for Independence. A new generation has come to the fore. The
struggle for Independence is as much our inheritance as the Himalayas,
the Ganges, the Plateau of Deccan, Ajanta, Taj Mahal and Mahabalipuram,
the arts, philosophy and science of India.
      Who is not filled with pride when thinking of the Buddha, Kabir, Nanak
and Gandhiji? We are filled with pride when we think of the sacrifices by
our freedom fighters who trailed a new path of truth and non-violence
during our freedom struggle.
      We have achieved considerable progress in the last 38 years. During
these years, we have been able to lift nearly 63 percent of our population
above the poverty line. A new middle class has emerged. We have become
self-sufficient in foodgrains. The entire world wonders at the way we have
been able to mould and advance our science and technology, our
independent foreign policy, our democracy, liberty and secularism. And we
have been able to achieve this despite the three or four wars we had to
face, preserving all the time the unity and integrity of India. We have been
able to do it because we were shown the right path by Gandhiji, Panditji
and Indiraji. The journey, however, is still very long and difficult. We have to
battle with poverty and eradicate it altogether. This is the only path for us to
follow and we have to eliminate poverty with all the strength at our
command.
       How was it that India could achieve all this while many other
developing countries have fallen on the wayside, embroiled in their own
difficulties? We could do it because we took recourse to science and
technology for the amelioration of poverty. We saw to it that science and
technology were applied in the right manner. The initiative was taken by
Panditji, by constructing huge dams, setting up large steel plants and
encouraging the promotion of science. He focussed his attention on the
poor and the farmers of India. The foundation laid by Panditji enabled the
farmers to treble their production with the help of science and technology.
This saved our confidence.
       Indiraji gave a new impetus to the eradication of poverty. In the last
few years, the percentage of people brought above the poverty line has
gone up from 49 to 63. In the last few weeks I have travelled over various
parts of the country. I have gone to tribal districts and villages and visited
hutments of the Harijans. I have travelled from from the hills to the desert of
Rajasthan. The problems of the poor were identical. In the cities too, I have
visited the hutments of the poor. The purpose of all this was to find how we
could improve our programmes and streamline the administration to ensure
that the poor people of India are able to receive full benefits from these
programmes.
      The path we have followed is the same which was shown to us by
Panditji to take science and technology to the hearths and homes of the
poorest of the poor. We are considering how this objective can be achieved
and how science and technology can be utilised to provide the maximum
benefit to the poor. For instance, we do not find a drop of water in the
deserts of Rajasthan. We can, however, use satellite pictures to locate
underground water. Similarly, we can provide better quality seeds to the
farmers to increase production. We would like to see that power, water and
other inputs reach
farmers and workers to help increase production and make the country
stronger. The country will forge ahead only when rural India is able to
march forward. We should devote our full energy for the uplift of rural India.
      We must see that regional imbalances in the growth of various parts
of the country are removed and all the States progress evenly. We shall
ensure that all citizens of the country get full opportunity to contribute their
might towards India's progress. It is towards this end that we have
formulated the Seventh Plan which aims not only at economic development
but the total advancement and
strengthening of Indian society. The framework of this Plan will be shortly
before you. We hope that the country will progress substantially under the
Plan and that in these five years, we shall march ahead at a pace at which
India has never marched before.
      There is no change in our principles. Following the path shown to us
by Gandhiji and Panditji, we want the development process to reach every
nook and corner of our country. Gandhiji talked of Swadeshi. Thirty eight
years ago, not even a needle was made in India. Swadeshi, then, meant
only Khadi. Panditji opened the vistas of science and technology for us and
India moved ahead. Today, when we talk of Swadeshi, we do not mean
Khadi alone. We mean indigenous industry, indigenous computer and
power from indigenous atomic energy sources. The meaning of Swadeshi
has undergone a sea-change in the last 38 years and it goes to prove how
much progress India has made. This is what we are proud of.
       However much we might progress and develop economically, I would
think that we have not really progressed if, in the process we lose our
inheritance, our traditions, our culture and civilisation. We have to see that
along with economic development, we develop and strengthen our
character. It is for this purpose that during this very month we shall present
to you a new format of education which we hope will bring about new
awareness in every corner and every
village country and will provide a new impetus to the country's progress.
We have to see that human development takes place with full vigour all
over the country.
     There are obstacles in our way, the biggest being internal
dissensions based on religion, caste, language or region. We must make
sure that these dissensions do not acquire extremist dimensions. We have
also to ensure that such disputes weaken the foundations of our
democracy. They weaken the coun and retard its progress.
       Many people have lost their lives due to extremist activities. Gandhiii
lost his life 38 years ago and Indiraji only ten months ago. Communal
conflicts have done immense harm to the country and we have to root out
communalism from the midst of us all. They have taken toll of not only
Gandhiji and Indiraji but have harmed every one in the country. Whenever
big leaders like Gandhiji and Indiraji die, its impact is felt all over the world.
Indira Gandhi was not the leader of India alone. The whole world
recognised her as a leader of the poor. There have been few leaders who
were able to make such a name for themselves in the world. Today the
country has to make a pledge to end communal differences and raise it
voice against terrorism. We have to make sure that we use our energies for
creating an atmosphere in which we can live like brothers.
      You thrust a responsibility on me 41 weeks ago. In these 41 weeks,
we have done many things to redeem our pledges. The biggest challenge
confronting us was to maintain the unity and integrity of India. Ten months
ago, the world was watching whether India would remain united or
disintegrate into pieces. Today, that question just does not arise. Today
India has emerged before the world as a very strong country. We had the
problem of terrorism in Punjab. We took steps and, a few weeks ago, an
agreement was signed. We hope that complete peace will be restored in
Punjab and the State will make rapid progress on the road to development.
The tension that existed has eased and the country can now move rapidly
ahead.
      The other problem was of Assam. Negotiations were going on for
many years but a solution had eluded us. I am happy to tell you that last
night, or rather today at 2.45 a.m., an agreement was signed between the
Assam students and the Government of India. We hope that with the
signing of this agreement, another element of tension will be removed and
the country will be able to address itself to rapid development.
       During the elections, we had promised to wage a battle against
corruption. We have taken a couple of steps and are in the process of
taking a third one in this direction. First of all, we brought the anti-defection
bill, got it passed and implemented it, removing thereby a great infirmity
from our politics. Secondly, we allowed political parties to accept donations.
This will minimise corruption. We are now ready to take the third step and
introduce the Lokpal bill. We hope this bill will be presented soon and a
major cause of complaint will be removed.
       We had also promised to cleanse the Ganga. The purity of Ganga
had a special significance for every Indian heart. But the Ganga is getting
polluted because we are dumping a great lot of rubbish into it. We are
taking firm and swift action to cleanse the Ganga. Likewise, we have vast
expanses of waste land in the country. We are going to plant crores of
trees in the waste lands to be able to provide firewood for the poor and
fodder for cattle. Recently, we have modified our textile policy. In
restructuring this policy, our endeavour is to see that our weavers are able
to sell more and earn larger profits.
       We had also pledged to strive for peace in our neighbourhood. We
initiated talks with Sri Lanka and these talks are being continued today in
Bhutan. We hope that just as we have been able to resolve the problem of
Punjab and Assam, they will also be able to bring about peace in Sri Lanka.
This will lead to an easing of tension in the South and our people will be
less worried. We are trying to improve further our friendly relations with
Bhutan, Nepal and China. We are also talking to Pakistan and have made
some progress. However, there is one major hurdle in our way. Their
Atomic Energy Programme makes us feel that Pakistan is moving towards
developing an atomic bomb. If there is to be complete friendship and
confidence between our two countries, Pakistan should reconsider this
programme.
      In the last few months I went to the Soviet Union and to the United
States of America and held the Indian Flag higher. Today, every citizen of
India can stand upright and look the world in the eye. India is independent
in every respect and strong and cannot be subjected to any pressure.
In certain parts of the world, the struggle for freedom started along with the
freedom struggle launched by Congress. When Congress won freedom,
many countries of Africa and Asia were able to gain their independence.
But in South Africa, where Gandhiji had first launched his movement, the
people are still enslaved and oppressed. We have extended our full support
to our brothers and sisters in South Africa who are struggling for their
independence. We wish that other countries too, especially the developed
countries, will extend similar support to them. We must see that slavery,
especially the kind of slavery practised in South Africa, is ended at the
earliest.
      All our pledges and all the measures we might take will be nullified if
we fail to remove poverty in our country. So, we are focussing our special
attention to poverty alleviation programmes. Wherever there are loopholes,
we are trying to plug them and implement our programmes more
vigorously. Where extra help is needed we are ready to give it. We are
reviewing these programmes and will shortly bring forth a modified
Programme structured in a manner that will ensure greater benefits to the
poor and lesser financial involvement of the administration. We hope that
the 63 percent lifted above the poverty line will grow into a larger proportion
rapidly in the coming years so that we are really able to proclaim to the
world that poverty has been eradicated from India.
     Today, on August 15, every citizen of the country should pledge to
dedicate his life for strengthening the nation and the values it stands for.
Hand in hand let us move forward faster to achieve our goals. Once again I
extend my greetings to you on ou Independence Day."
1984,Indira Gandhi,INC,Guarding the Flag of Freedom,"Free rendering of an address in Hindi from the Red Fort, Delhi, August 15,1984","Selected Speeches of Indira Gandhi: January 1, 1982-October 30, 1984",NA,"We assemble here on August 15, every year. It is not a mere ritual
function. We assemble here in the memory of those of our brave
countrymen who suffered during the long struggle for Independence and
also sacrificed their lives. This movement had a long time-span and people
today do not know about it as much as they should. The younger
generation is hardly familiar with it. I cannot describe it all here. However,
just to illustrate, how people belonging to different religions were
associated with the struggle, I should like to mention of some of our leaders
who participated in the freedom movement. Tilak, Dadabhai Naoroji, Dr.
Ansari of Delhi, Tayabji Saheb were people of one generation. Then,
Mahatma Gandhi returned to India and the course of the freedom
movement took a new turn in which not only the intelligentsia and other
distinguished people participated, but also farmers, workers, the younger
generation and people drawn from various walks of life became
co-partners.
       Why do we hoist the national flag on the Red Fort? This place had
not been a symbol of Independence. In fact, it is a symbol of the olden
days. Netaji Subhas Bose declared that when we became independent, we
would hoist the national flag on the Red Fort. For this reason, the first
Prime Minister of India, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, hoisted the national in
August 1947, and since then, every Prime Minister is performing this duty.
Prior to that, three of our brave countrymen were imprisoned in this Red
Fort. They had not adopted our path. Although their path was different, they
too were prepared to sacrifice everything for the cause of freedom and their
love for the country. People of Delhi know Shri Shah Nawaz Khan. He was
a Muslim. Then, there were Prem Sehgal and Dhillon. This selection was
neither ours, nor of the alien rulers. Still, by coincidence, they belonged to
three different religions. I am saying all this because I feel we should know
how the country became independent.
      We got independence because people of all religions, all provinces
and all communities were united. There was only one objective-- freedom
of the country. Freedom is our birthright. Today we have different issues
before us. During those days, we had only one objective and we fought for
it. Today, we have to preserve the Independence thus gained and the
efforts for this cannot be less arduous. The obstacles, the barriers, the
dangers and the threats we faced during those days are all present even
today, though in different shapes.
       Some people say that I talk of these external dangers in order to
divert the people's attention from the domestic issues. There cannot be a
greater misunderstanding than this, because we cannot maintain the
solidarity of the nation and solve our problems without knowing fully the
travails the country is confronted with and the difficulties that people of all
walks of life are facing. We are glad that we are free, but our hearts today
are not full of joy. We have sorrows and anxieties. We are sad because we
have not learnt the lessons of our history. We are sad because such forces
are again raising their head which may endanger the unity of the country by
spreading poison.
      I should like to remind you that communal disturbances which take
place in the name of religion and cost lives of numerous innocent people
and lead to destruction of property, are not communal alone, though they
appear to be so. Behind these are political and economic considerations
and narrowness of mind.
      Communal disturbances have occurred in Andhra Pradesh,
Karnataka, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh in the recent past. Some have
also taken place in other States. The sorrow is not only that of individuals,
families or communities but of entire India. It is a black spot on the entire
country and it is our duty to root out all such elements from our soil.
      In our democratic system, there may be differences in many spheres
but we rise above them. To achieve the objective of keeping the country
united, we have to transcend political and party-based differences which
create dissensions between one another. If we cannot remain united and
the country does not remain strong, with whom shall we have differences?
Against whom shall we fight? With whom shall we make friendship, if
nobody exists? Brothers and sisters, if the country falls, nobody survives.
When we were fighting for the freedom of our country, it did not mean only
political freedom. It also meant social justice, equality and economic justice.
Only one phase is over and another one is under way. We have to cover a
long and difficult path. Whereas the enemies were visible during those
days, now they are in disguise. Some of them are open enemies, but many
become unintentional pawns of others.
        Everyone of us has now Punjab in mind. I do not want to go into the
story of Punjab here. I have spoken about it a number of times. However,
since some sinister propaganda is being carried on, I should like to say a
few words. A vast number of people are participating in this function though
all of them are not present and visible here.
      Since I spoke to you last year, TV and radio have reached a large
number of remote villages. So also power supply has improved and
drinking water has reached many new areas. All efforts have been made to
help the poor, be it in the field of medical assistance or educational. I shall
talk about this later. At the moment, I should like to say that whatever
movements are conducted in one or another State with any ostensible
purpose, in course of time these pass into the hands of elements who do
not subscribe to the objectives of the movement or have something else in
their mind, giving a new turn to the entire movement. They bring violence,
murder, intimidation and so on into the movements and the organizers of
the
movement lose control over the situation. This is exactly what has
happened in Punjab.
      Propaganda is being carried on, specially in foreign newspapers and
television, giving the impression as if we did not even discuss the demands
that had been put forward. You all know how long-drawn-out the
discussions were. Differences were narrowed down to only a few points. As
taught by Gandhiji, Jawaharlal Nehru and Maulana Azad, it has been our
policy, whether within the country or in the international field, to reach the
maximum possible extent of understanding, thus maintaining friendship,
and not giving any offence from our side.
       Whosoever has any demand, be he pro or against me, I have always
listened to it and have tried to meet it as far as possible. But I have my
limitations. The resources are limited. Funds are limited. We cannot go
beyond these limitations. Sometimes there are demands which please
some sections of the people but annoy others and can lead to serious
discontent in other States. Therefore, we have to consider all the relevant
factors. I should like to request those who have some demands either in
the name of a State or a religion or a language or some other issue, to look
around to ensure that the fulfilment of their demand does not aggrieve
others. They should think whether their demand would not impose an
economic burden on the country which may weaken the country or crush it
altogether under its load. Economic hardship will not spare them either. We
have taken care of everyone in our plans and it is our effort to help all
sections of the people and States, so that they may all progress and
develop.
       Nowadays, the relations between the Centre and the States are being
discussed. I too, have said that we can discuss them and I am confident
that if the issue is approached sincerely, a compromise can be arrived at
easily.
      In 1960-61, the States were getting a sum of Rs. 500 crore from the
Centre. Now, they are getting Rs. 12,000 crore. A stupendous increase,
indeed. Still neither the States are happy nor the Central Ministries
contented. They all say that they are not getting enough. I agree that
amount does not suffice for their needs but we must also not forget that
even in rich countries, the needs of all cannot be met fully.
       Demands will not only remain, but will in fact increase. What we have
to see is that while meeting the demands of those people who are
comparatively well off, we do not ignore or cause harm to those people who
are weak and underprivileged. They must not get poorer as a result of the
fulfilment of the demands of the affluent. The country will become strong
only if the poor people of the country also become strong. In their strength
lies the welfare of the affluent as well.
       I hope that demands will be put forth not to further self-interests but to
secure the welfare of the country and for helping the relatively weaker
sections as well as for the all-round progress of the country. This is why our
emphasis has been on helping the weaker sections as far as possible. This
is the objective of the 20-Point Programme through which 15 million
families have been helped to raise their standard of living. Many countries
do not have even a total population of 15 million. But in a country with a
population of 700 million, the figure is not that impressive. There is no
magic that can benefit all these 700 million people immediately.
       The 20-Point Programme was initiated only recently. Employment
has been arranged through it and successes have been achieved in
providing employment to a good number of young men, rural as well as
urban. Progress has also been made in providing loans as well as in other
fields. I know there are shortcomings. I know that some people have made
mistakes. Some people have complained to me in this regard.
       Those who do not reside in Delhi, or are listening to me for the first
time, may be surprised to know that whenever I am in Delhi, barring the
holidays, I meet people in my house every morning, ranging from a few to a
few thousand. These people come from all walks of life, all religions and all
parts of the country. Some people say they come just to see me, some
others narrate their woes, a few others lodge complaints and some others
praise the progress made. There are people who think that I waste my time
by meeting them. Many leaders of other countries do not do so. But I feel
that this helps me in getting an idea of the true picture of the country and
the feelings of the people. It is certainly not a waste of time.
      The area under irrigation has increased considerably. Some of our
farmer friends have launched agitations. But whatever we could achieve for
the farmers during the last four years remains unparalleled. Of course, the
farmers were always given due consideration during the freedom
movement as also afterwards. Actually, they were at the root of our
movement. They are our food-givers. I know that the prices of some of the
commodities that they consume have gone up. We are trying to help them,
have actually done so. Chemical fertilizers are being supplied to them at
rates lower than the actuals by providing subsidies to the extent of Rs. 800
crore. This is not an easy task for a poor country. The prices of their
products have also comparatively increased. It is, however, true that the
commodities that they need have become dearer in our country as well as
in other countries. It is also true that along with progress, demands keep on
increasing.
      People who could not even think of tractors and threshers and were
not using chemical fertilizers or pesticides two or three years ago have now
started using them and their demands for these commodities are on the
increase. Demands, however, outpace production. This results in rise in
prices. We have to take all these factors into consideration. If we are
dependent on them, they too are dependent on the production of the
factories. We have to pay attention to the industrial workers also and
ensure justice to them. Sometimes we are at fault, at times the millowners
are to blame and at other times they are themselves at fault. The existence
of many unions in a factory or a unit and their internal rivalries not only
result in wastage of time, but also harm production. We have to pay
attention to such things.
      Every section should view its problems in the larger perspective of
India to be able to appreciate the difficulties of others-farmers, industrial
workers, housewives, etc. Housewives are trying to run their households
most economically in these days of rising prices. Not only the people of
India but of the entire world are victims of rising prices. We are trying our
best to make available essential commodities to the people throughout the
country.
      A sum of Rs. 850 crore is being spent to help the rationing system to
carry food grains to the remotest areas. We are trying to augment this
amount. If somebody indulges in dishonest practices and corruption,
stringent action should be taken against him. For this, however, it is
necessary to know immediately who did what and where. If people say it is
done by all and everywhere, it will be difficult to take action against the
culprits. Local people have to be vigilant in this regard. If they remain alert,
no atrocities can be perpetuated on the Harijans, people of the minority
communities and womenfolk. Alertness will help solutions to problems. We
are trying to further tighten legislation in this regard. We also try to foresee
the problems and solutions thereof, even before they come to the surface.
       This is an age of self-reliance. Our slogan is that our nation should be
self-reliant. What does a nation mean? It is not the land, but each one of
you wheresoever you may be living. We want all of you to be self-reliant.
We are trying to help you to become that. It casts a responsibility upon you
-- the responsibility to do your duty. Please see that violence does not take
place. Please see that holy or religious places are not converted into focal
points of violence and crime and accumulation of arms. It is your duty to
see that communalism does not raise its head. Wherever there are
indications, please go there, as our workers used to do during the days of
the freedom movement. They used to bring about peace in the area by
pacifying the people's anger.
      This is feasible, because we have done it in the past. India has
accomplished many tremendous tasks in the past and I am confident about
the future as well.
       Dangers always exist in a country. In a country of diversities of
religions and languages, beliefs and traditions, internal rivalries are quite
natural to an extent. But we have never considered diversities to be a
symbol of weakness. On the contrary, diversities enrich us and add to the
picturesqueness of our society. We do not want any religion or tradition to
be curtailed. Everyone should be able to follow his own path.
       But all the paths should merge in the ocean of Indianness, as the
rivers merge into the sea. The synthesis of different beliefs and traditions
constitutes Indianness: We must follow our faiths sincerely and should not
impose ourselves on people not belonging to our own faith. If the people
follow their faiths sincerely, they will prove better citizens. No religion
preaches violence. Every religion urges brotherhood, love and compassion.
If the country follows this path, we shall be able to build a new society.
      A new society is even now being shaped, and modernity is emerging
out of the old traditions. This is one reason why some problems have
cropped up in our country. Some pressures and problems have also come
from outside. Life is a mixture of sorrows and happiness. Each one of you,
whether a child or the grown up, must have experienced this in your life. To
rise above our sorrows or to be crushed under them lies in our hands. No
Government or political party can offer help in this regard. It is our
self-confidence and the internal power that help us to overcome them.
Today, on Independence Day, we should bear this in mind.
      During the last four years, as you would have seen or heard or read,
some events have taken place every year which enhanced the prestige of
our country in the community of nations and also in our hearts. We,
however, do not take advantage of that as other countries do. By 'we', I do
not mean me or the Government, but the people of India. We did not make
use of them to strengthen further our unity and the national pride, as all
others do. This has been our shortcoming.
      When the Asian Games were held here, I know how pleased the
people of Delhi were. Young men belonging to Opposition parties also
came to me and expressed their happiness and thanked me for holding the
Games, although they said they did not agree with me in many other
matters. A propaganda was, however, carried on that so much of money
was being wasted without any useful return. You saw recently, in what spirit
another country took up the same job. We have to see in what spirit the
entire country should utilize such occasions so as to strengthen the unity,
morale and self-respect of the country, instead of viewing events from a
partisan angle. This is the greatest need.
      Now, another responsibility has developed upon us the responsibility
for some other countries besides our own. People call it leadership. I am
not fond of becoming a leader. I would only say that we have been
provided with an opportunity to serve a hundred other countries in the best
possible manner. I admit there are differences amongst us.
     Fighting is going on in some countries and we are trying to stop it,
although we have not succeeded so far. For example, the war between Iran
and Iraq. We are in constant touch with the leaders of these countries. We
are also corresponding with other leaders to explore possible solutions.
Many people have come here. Our officers and ministers have also visited
these two countries besides other countries and our efforts are still on.
Some other countries are also facing disturbances.
       Recently, disturbances have broken out in one of our neighbouring
countries. As you know, our policy has been of friendship and we have not
ignored any avenue that leads to improved friendship, whether it is
Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, or Sri Lanka. They are our close neighbours.
Many years ago, when Jawaharlal Nehru was Prime Minister, he had
suggested that India and Pakistan should enter into a No-War Pact. The
same thing was repeated by the late respected Shastriji and myself in
different forms and on different occasions. Pakistan, however, did not
respond. After I became the Prime Minister again, and they acquired
sophisticated weapons, they linked it with the idea of such a pact. We are
not against it. We ourselves want it, but we said: So far you had been
ignoring our suggestions and now, since you have raised this issue, will it
not be proper to have a treaty of friendship, co-operation and peace
between us, so as to create a better atmosphere? If we enter into such a
pact, naturally, there will be no war. Otherwise also, all these were part of
the Simla Agreement. These have been recorded and duly signed by the
two countries. If, however, you do not like that agreement, we can have a
new agreement on these lines. But to say no to a treaty of friendship,
cooperation and peace, and still ask for a No-War Pact, I ask you, my
friends, how is it possible? How can we take it seriously? Still, we are trying
to have something. I am sorry to find that their TV and newspapers carry
reports about India which are far from reality and which may also be termed
as interference in our internal matters. Still, we are taking up matters with
them in all courtesy and in a friendly manner. But no government can
overlook the interests of the country and its self-respect.
      The situation in Sri Lanka is quite grave and my heart is full of grief
for those innocent people who are being attacked without having done
anything wrong. There are extremists and terrorists there as well and it is
evident that a government is required to counter them. But the manner in
which a particular community is being attacked for the last so many years
has come in the way of restoration of peace and the situation has gradually
deteriorated. We do not want to interfere. We do not want to put any
obstacle in the unity of another country. That would not be in our interest.
We want our neighbouring countries to be stable and friendly towards us.
We extended our hand of friendship and offered help in having a dialogue
and arriving at some conclusions acceptable to all.
       The grief is of our entire country, although our Tamil brothers are
affected most by the happenings there. Already 40,000 refugees have
arrived. It is possible that people other than the sufferers may also have
come with them and there may also be some spies amongst them. I cannot
say what is the actual position. Our frontiers are such that in spite of our
best efforts, such intrusions cannot always be checked. Still, we are making
efforts. Patrolling has been intensified. I urged the President of Sri Lanka to
have a dialogue somehow. He had himself suggested this and we had
hoped that under his leadership progress would be made and an
agreement would be arrived at. But so far I find only reports of unpleasant
incidents. We are fully seized of the problem and we have all sympathy for
the suffering people.
       Our sea frontiers are vulnerable. But when I talk about these, it is not
for diverting attention from our internal problems. I want our internal
problems to be solved expeditiously so that we remain united and strong
enough to face any danger. By accusing each other, or by lowering the
morale of the police force and the army, we cannot make the country
strong. Whenever aggressions have taken place, our jawans have faced
them bravely and sacrificed their lives. Whenever a calamity has occurred,
whether in the form of floods or something else- our jawans have
participated in the fight for peace and helped people. How can we not
praise them? It is natural for a human being to err sometimes, whether a
jawan or a politician or a public servant. Just because of the fault of one,
we should not weaken the morale of the country. This will be neither in the
interest of the country nor in that of a citizen, or a political party. I am very
sorry to see that some people do not hesitate in raising any point if it helps
them get some publicity or benefit. I do not think that will really benefit
them. On the other hand, this will harm the country and our morale.
      We must remember, on this Independence Day, that just to attain
Independence is not enough. We have to strive consistently to preserve it.
We must guard this flame of freedom from every storm through our labour
and, if necessary, by laying down our life. Each one of us must take this
vow today.
       Earlier, when I referred to the 20-Point Programme, I stated that the
uplift of the poor people and weaker sections of the society and to help the
small farmers were our objectives. More than Rs. 1.000 crore have been
allotted for these programmes. If a problem is faced in any part of the
country, we take care of it. Soon the Seventh Plan will be launched. The
objectives of this Plan are already known to you. These are: food,
employment and productivity. All these are interrelated. If production does
not increase, there cannot be employment, as also food. To achieve these
objectives, we have placed adequate funds exclusively for the purpose.
This will strengthen further the foundations of our country. Simultaneously,
we have to help each other.
      The struggle for the country's freedom had started even prior to our
movement, but it did not succeed, because it was not a combined effort.
You know what happened in 1857. You may hear about it more this
evening. Why did not that revolution succeed? Because the people, in spite
of sympathizing with it, did not step forward as soldiers for the cause.
      We know that the last phase of the movement led by Gandhiji started
on August 9, 1942. We celebrate the day every year. Why did we succeed?
It was not because of violence, or enmity towards anyone. Our enmity was
not towards Englishmen or England, but towards imperialism. We fought
against imperialism and even today we are with people fighting against
imperialism, as in South Africa. Besides the local population, Indians too
are there. They do not have any freedom. They do not enjoy even the
elementary rights of citizenship. Therefore, how can we not raise our voice
in their favour?
     You have to think over all this. One great leader had said, if one
person is deprived of freedom, all of us lose our freedom. If any country is
enslaved, the shadows of slavery fall on us all. Freedom and peace must
prevail universally. Their blessing must be available to all.
       India had been trying for peace everywhere. Recently, along with the
Presidents or Prime Ministers of five other countries, I issued an appeal to
the nations of the world against nuclear weapons. A one-hundredth part of
the nuclear weapons now in store is enough to annihilate the entire
humanity. Still, these weapons are being manufactured and accumulated.
And India is blamed. India has some nuclear capacity. Our scientists have
proved that they can do it. But we do not want to develop our nuclear
capacity to produce a bomb. We do not have a single bomb. We want to
use nuclear power to produce energy so as to help the farmers, we want to
use it for medical science.
      No programme of ours, whether it relates to space, sports, or
science, can succeed if our young men do not come forward. Had they not
enough capability, we could not have advanced. We are doing all this to
minimize the sufferings of the poor people and the middle class people of
the country in whom lies the nation's strength. In some fields we lag behind.
This is but natural in view of the fact that the industrial revolution took place
in some major countries 200 years ago. Now, how do we catch up with
them, if our young people do not engage themselves in constructive work
but indulge in destruction?
      I am repeating this time and again because I know the creative
capacity of our new generation. Our young people who are at school or
college or in other institutions, have constructive talents. We have only to
bring them out. We are forgetting our ancient ideals. We talk of religions
and tradition, but do not pay attention to their basics. Their spirit calls for
being good to others, helping others and creating a peaceful atmosphere. If
we forget these ideals, we cannot advance. We have to bring about a
social change and improve economic conditions. At the same time, we
have to develop our spiritual strength without which we cannot be a great
nation. We have to develop our moral values which are in abundance in
India. We must not lose them.
      This flag is a symbol, and not a mere piece of cloth. It is a symbol of
the Independence of India, the sacrifice of India and the bright future of
India. Today, we all express our sympathies for all those who are suffering
on account of drought or floods or communal riots or some other reasons,
and pray for their well-being. I also pray for good rains, so that food
production goes up and reaches one and all. This will help our country to
march on the path of progress and show to the world a new road of peace
and friendship."
1983,Indira Gandhi,INC,Make India Strong and Great,"Free rendering of an address in Hindi from the Red Fort, Delhi, August 15, 1983","Selected Speeches of Indira Gandhi: January 1, 1982-October 30, 1984",NA,"A birth anniversary, be it of an individual or of a country. is an
auspicious occasion and a day of rejoicing. All of us celebrate it, be it here
or in our homes. In earlier years, the radio carried the voice from here to
the other parts of the country. Last year, however, television began carrying
the images from here to a few big cities. But today television pictures of this
ceremony will reach many small towns also, marking the beginning of the
programme to reach television to 70 percent area of the country. This is
how all progress takes place- gradually.
      It is a day when we recall our struggle for independence. We
remember Mahatma Gandhi, his other colleagues and disciples and many
others about whom you must have read. But there were hundreds and
thousands of other brave freedom fighters who also sacrificed everything. A
few thousand of them fortunately are still with us. We remember them all
and when we remember them, we also ponder as to what lesson we should
learn from their sacrifices.
      There are some who say that whichever Prime Minister spoke from
the Red Fort, repeated the same thing every year. What a strange thing to
say! The ideals that we set for ourselves, the things that build up character
and raise the morale of the people, concern for the security, progress and
development of the country- are not all these duties incumbent on us
today? Can our basic thinking ever get outdated? Should we not remember
these duties each year, indeed each day! And repeat them to ourselves, in
our hearts and minds? This is true not only of our country, it is true of all
countries. This is not the occasion to talk at great length about our
achievements, of the big things that have been done for raising the
standard of living of the common people. But the record is there for
everyone to see. Our own countrymen, as also people of other countries,
know about it and you must have read how the leaders of big countries
have been talking about it. It does not mean, however, that our task has
been completed. It also does not mean that we have turned all our
aspirations into reality. But it does mean that we have progressed along the
path shown to us by our great leaders and that we continue to advance
despite all difficulties and dangers and despite the fact that at times we
have also faltered. Perhaps many of the difficulties we face today are due
to this fact.
       Once enslaved, poor, oppressed and timid, this country is today able
to hold its head high. You look at the achievements. Some of them are
really big. We have increased power generation. Earlier, power was
available in a mere 3,000 cities and towns, and hardly any villages. Today,
3 lakh villages have been electrified and, of course, power is available in all
towns. This is only a small example of what has indeed happened. I have
already mentioned about television. You also know how we have sent our
own satellites into space and how we can utilize them for the benefit of the
farmers and others. At Kalpakkam, near Madras, our engineers, with wholly
indigenous know-how, have set up an atomic power plant. In another two
months we plan to send another satellite into space. All these are big steps
which have relevance to our life, to the lives of the working class and
students and also the everyday lives of housewives. Since we met here
last, the Asian Games were organized in this city. It was a show of young
people. That was followed by the Nonaligned Summit, which was an
indication of India's capabilities, and the whole world had occasion witness
it.
      I also take this opportunity to congratulate our young sportsmen who
have kept the country's head high. I specially want to congratulate our
cricket team for winning the World Cup recently. Those young men remind
us of the brave youth whose courage shone through during our freedom
struggle.
       But do not imagine that other young men, our children, our farmers
and our workers, don't deserve congratulations. All of them sweat hard in
their given field of activity and step by step they are carrying India forward. I
congratulate them all. We do not know their names, we have not seen
them, nor can we identify them. Yet, they are the foundation of India- the
poor belonging to the Scheduled Castes, the tribals and the backward
communities. I myself do not believe in caste and I would wish that it is
rooted out from our country. We should all consider ourselves one. We are
equal citizens of a great country.
      Today, when we look at our achievements, we should also cast a
glance at our shortcomings. What are the things that have held us back
and what are the stumbling blocks which do not let us progress fast enough
if we were to learn a lesson from the freedom struggle, we would find that
only unity and discipline lead to success. We find today that intentionally or
unintentionally some people and some sections of the community hurt
society in the name of that community, hurt religion in the name of religion,
and hurt the country in the name of their region. These are our
weaknesses. These are the elements that have held India back, eroded
morale and sapped self-confidence.
       There are agitations in many parts of the country and people are
making demands. This is but natural in a democracy. We are always
prepared to talk to people and also meet their demands to the extent
possible. But we also have to be careful all the time that while meeting the
demands of one group, we do not hurt the interests of others or weaken
them. Therefore, while considering these demands we have to discuss with
all concerned and take into consideration their interests. We cannot satisfy
all, but the least we can attempt is to see that there is minimum
dissatisfaction. Whether the leaders of agitations want it or not, experience
shows that violence creeps in. We cannot always find out who indulges in
violence. When we find out, we do punish such people. Sometimes the
agitators themselves do not know who is indulging in violence, but it harms
the country all the same and the developmental process stops. Thus, those
who launch agitations complaining of neglect contribute to the slowing
down of development.
       Let us look at some of the problems that dog us. There is the problem
of Assam, about which there has been some strange propaganda. There
are certain aspects of the problem which have an element of truth. It is true
that foreigners have come and our effort is to stop their infiltration, identify
those who have entered illegally and make some other arrangements for
them. This is not something new. When I discussed in the first time, I made
some suggestions to the leaders of the Assam agitation. They said, ""Either
you accede to all our demands or we will not let you go forward with
whatever you want to do."" The result was that the process of identification,
which could have gone ahead in the last few years, was held up. Now they
want that process to be started and this work has begun just as we had
earlier offered.
       There is another strange accusation. Many people lost their lives in
the attacks that took place there. Many of them were our Muslim brothers
and sisters. Their villages were burnt. But also those of Hindus, tribals,
Scheduled Castes, labourers from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. I have
expressed sympathy towards all the victims and condemned those who
took the law into their own hands. Yet, the propaganda is as though we had
a hand in the killings. If you go and talk to the affected people, they will say
clearly who was really engaged in rescuing and protecting them and
making their lives secure. It is true that at places the security was lax which
resulted in killings. To that extent it is our responsibility but the propaganda
suggests as though we instigated the killings. Who are the people indulging
in this propaganda? They are the very persons who delivered inflammatory
speeches, instigated people and created an atmosphere of threat and
violence.
       There is also the problem of Punjab. I do not want to go into the
details: they have been repeatedly mentioned. Our effort in this country has
always been to see that every community and every region receives justice
and a fair share of the total wealth and resources of the country. Whatever
demands I could meet from my side were accepted by me at the very
beginning, but will it be just on my part to take decisions which may
concern other regions and on which there may be no agreement? I may
recall that it is being alleged that I am deliberately stalling a decision. Can
the Central Government gain if any region or any community were to
remain weak? Won't it rather weaken the Central Government itself
because our strength depends on the strength of our regions? What is the
Centre? Is it only the City of Delhi or the Secretariat or the Prime Minister's
Office? The Centre is that which holds everyone together and is
responsible for the security of the country. It is also responsible for
ensuring justice to all. Therefore, no one who is at a comparative
advantage whether an individual or a State should claim more than due. All
the same, the real power belongs to our States. Whenever there are
constraints on resources, it puts strain on us as well. There are cuts
imposed on the Central ministries and also on the States. We are not
happy about it, but we are helpless. If there are rains, it immediately
changes our prospects: but in the event of drought or floods we all suffer. If
the agitations, on which so much money is spent, were not there, we could
make headway faster.
      I was speaking about Punjab. This problem came up before me about
two years back. My Government came into power in 1980. I should like to
remind you that the people who are today agitating and making demands
were in power in Punjab for three years earlier. During those three years
they had all the opportunities to resolve their problems and meet their own
demands. However, they did not raise their voice then. I should like to ask
them and also pose this question to you, as to why they did not resolve
these problems. Aren't they guilty of failure to act when they had the
opportunities? Why did they not act? Probably because even at that time
they could not have got whatever they wanted. So, when we came to
power the entire responsibility was thrust on us. We are ready to resolve
the problem provided the agitators are willing to sit down and reach an
agreement with those others also who are concerned with this problem.
      There are many other voices being raised which make us feel that the
strength and unity of the country may be threatened. Fortunately, the sense
of unity in the country is very strong. In connection with Assam, another
false propaganda is being carried out throughout India. When I spoke about
the minorities, I used to be accused of being more concerned about
Muslims, Sikhs, Christians and other minorities. It was alleged that I was
not bothered about the Hindu majority. May I remind you that in our
country one community may be in a minority in one part and in a majority in
another? Similarly, people belonging to one religion may be in a minority at
one place and in a majority at another. The new line taken by detractors is
that I am not at all worried about the minorities and that I go along with
what the majority wants.
      All political parties want votes at the time of elections. But today,
standing here on the ramparts of the Red Fort and recalling our freedom
struggle, let us also remember the era in which we were born, the life we
spent, the sacrifices we made and the services we rendered. While it is
natural to rejoice in victory and be saddened by defeat, our tradition
teaches us that there is something above victory and defeat, and that is our
duty. Our duty is to take care of our country. Even though we may not be
able to complete the task, we should proceed along the path of progress to
the extent we are capable.
      Many people laid down their lives during the freedom struggle. Many
did not live to see Independence. When we were young we did not imagine
that we would be able to attain freedom within our lifetime. Yet that thought
did not let us falter in our step nor did it weaken our resolve. We knew that
we would take the country up to the point we were capable of and that later
others would carry the flag. Today we are engaged in the task of
development in the same spirit and the same spirit moves us in making the
country stronger.
       The country faces many dangers. There are external dangers and our
internal weaknesses. I do not want to scare you and I know that you are not
the ones to be scared. It is our responsibility, however, to recognize the
situation. Only when we recognize the crisis can we keep ourselves fully
prepared to face it. Today imperialism is not of the kind it used to be. Today
it does not intrude into a country with troops. It exerts a variety of pressures
in a surreptitious manner, pressures which are economic, political and of
other kinds, which are not less pernicious than armed intrusion and in fact
more dangerous because the common people are not able to recognize
them. We have seen what has happened in many countries. They are
independent and yet there is a shadow over their independence. India does
not want that. Our path is clear. We want to be self-reliant through
democracy, socialism and nonalignment. Some say that we are tilting this
way or that, but we take all our decisions keeping the interest of India in
view as also the interest of world peace. We might be more friendly with
some than others but we have not allowed friendship or disagreement to
come in the way of our decisions. We take the right decision and it is that
which accounts for whatever success we have had in all spheres. Everyone
knows that we are a country with ideals. It does not mean that we are able
to achieve all our ideals or that we do not have failings and do not commit
mistakes.
       Unfortunately, the problem of corruption comes up and we regret to
say that corruption is there. But it will be wrong if we were to raise the issue
of corruption to the level of a bogey and insist that it will grow stronger. We
have to see how to eradicate this evil from our life. There is corruption in
other countries, too, but we are not concerned with them. We are
concerned with ourselves and we must fully strive to root out this problem
from all spheres-- from politics, from among the officials, from traders and
others. We must raise our sights above our own gains and ask ourselves
whether we are prepared to weaken the entire society for our own petty
gain. We should ask ourselves whether we are prepared to bring in a
situation wherein our future generations will be harmed. Every citizen has
to give thought to it. Atrocities have been committed against women. This is
not something new. The time has come when this cannot be tolerated any
more. The time has come when the entire society must see that no atrocity
is tolerated either against women or against men. Our women, our young
men, our farmers who are the country's backbone, our workers who are our
limbs and all our people- whatever region, language or religion they may
belong to-- must be strengthened. All of them have the right to receive
justice and they will be strong only when they do receive justice. This
stupendous task cannot be carried out by the Government or the officials
alone. It can be accomplished only when every citizen realizes that as a
citizen of India it is equally his responsibility because that alone will ensure
his future. And if the future were dim, it will not only hurt him but will also
hurt the coming generations. This is the spirit that must be imbibed.
       I said just now that the country faced dangers. There may be no
direct threat to our borders at this time. But there is an atmosphere of war
throughout the world. India has always been peaceful and that is why we
have had a big role in initiating the Nonaligned Movement. We want
friendship with our neighbours. There have been some recent
developments and I should like to reiterate that we do not want to interfere
in the affairs of any other country. Countries must resolve their internal
problems themselves. But if there is large-scale violence, killings and loot,
we have to condemn it. And we have always done so. In our neighbouring
country, Sri Lanka, with whom India has had close relations, things have
happened which have also affected the Indian citizens there. It is natural for
us to be concerned. We have no intention to interfere. We want to maintain
our friendship and our relations. We do not want that anyone should suffer
but because our people have been attacked, our own citizens and those
who emigrated from here, we are particularly concerned and we express
our sympathy with those who have been the victims of violence. We must
deal with all these problems in the most responsible manner. One wrong
step taken in excitement could lead to far-reaching harm, making it difficult
to restore balance. By God's grace we have so far shown great
forbearance in all these international problems.
       We have always tried first to understand the problem and then take
steps with great care and caution. In this way we have succeeded in our
efforts. We should not do anything which may harm those whom we want
to help. People of Indian origin are living in several countries and some of
them have become citizens of the countries of their adoption but some
have remained Indian citizens. We should keep the interests of all those
people in mind. We do not want to interfere in anybody's internal affairs.
When humanitarian aspect is involved, we must speak out.
      As I have said earlier, I am not concerned with any one caste or
religion. I am concerned for all, whether they are Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs or
of other religions. I am concerned because they all belong to India, not
because they belong to any particular religion. They are all human beings.
Today's world is convulsed by an economic crisis. There are challenges
everywhere. There is unemployment. Here, I want to say something about
the unemployment in our own country. It is a serious problem and we have
been paying attention to it. We have just evolved two schemes, one for the
landless people who are the worst hit in our countryside and who bear the
brunt of the problem of unemployment. We want that at least one member
of each family should get employment. This programme is going to be
launched shortly and a big sum has been provided for it. Initially, this
programme was started in Maharashtra where it was a success. We are,
therefore, now extending it to the entire country. But I should like to remind
you that we cannot cover everyone all at once. We hope that initially we will
be able to cover about 30 lakh persons and as we achieve success, others
also will be covered by the programme.
      Similarly, in the urban areas, the educated young men are under
severe strain. It is our effort, therefore, to provide resources every year for
2.5 lakh educated unemployed young men to stand on their own legs.
Thus, each year new programmes are introduced.
      Many people have ridiculed our 20-Point Programme, but the fact
remains that it has made an impact. There have been some shortcomings
but generally it has benefited people and is continuing to benefit them. You
can see its impact if you go to the villages. Those who ridiculed the
programme perhaps don't remember what the countryside was like and
what kind of poverty prevailed. It is a matter of satisfaction that the old
scenario has now faded out. We are progressing and we shall continue to
progress.
      We do not want to fight with anyone, but you know that we have been
attacked in the past and it has been an experience which we cannot forget.
We, therefore, have to keep ourselves in readiness. Here I want to say a
word about the brave officers and jawans of our armed forces. They have
defended our borders with great courage and bravery. With the same
devotion, they are also helping our people during floods and other natural
calamities in peace time. They deserve our congratulations.
        We must forget high or low, we must forget where we live, what is our
status and what are our views. But we must remember our motto to make
India strong and great and all our thoughts must be how to progress along
that path. I greet you all once again, particularly our young men and
women. In their eyes there is new hope, on their shoulders new
responsibilities, and in their hearts new courage. We are all full of this new
spirit, whatever be our age. In this I include myself. You and I are but
servants of one nation. We must not think about our status; we must
always think in terms of serving the weaker sections and those who, due to
some reason, have remained backward. We must always think how to list
the downtrodden so that we may march forward together and make the
country strong and great. We must strengthen the country not only from the
economic or political point of view but also morally and intellectually. Let us
today take a pledge that we will not do or say anything which may
denigrate our country in any way. We must keep the common man's morale
high, make him self-confident and self-reliant. If we take this pledge and act
accordingly in the next year, then we can work wonders. Not once but
many times we the people of India have shown that whenever we take a
decision with firm determination, we can achieve success. Let us show this
once again, my brothers and sisters. I again salute you and wish you a
happy future."
1982,Indira Gandhi,INC,Let us all Build a Strong Nation,"Free rendering of an address in Hindi from the Red Fort, Delhi, August 15, 1982","Selected Speeches of Indira Gandhi: January 1, 1982-October 30, 1984",NA,"I want to reach the millions of my countrymen, not only those who are
sitting in front of me, or the people of Delhi, but also those who are
witnessing this function through INSAT and are participating with us in this
happy celebration. I also want my voice to reach those millions of my Indian
brothers and sisters who are outside the country and those who cannot
listen to me either through the radio or the INSAT but only through their
hearts.
      Today is our 36th Independence Day, and we are standing in front of
the historic Red Fort which throughout modern history has been the symbol
of our urge for Independence. From 1858 to the time when Gandhiji
launched his non-violent movement and to the time when Netaji Subhash
Bose created an army, all Indians had but one desire to see the flag of
independent India flying on the Red Fort. And then 35 years ago
Jawaharlal Nehru for the first time unfurled our flag here. His connection
with the Red Fort had been established even earlier when he, together with
other brave people of the country, had come forward in defence of the
people imprisoned at the Red Fort.
       In a way, we can say that today is a day of tears for those millions
who fought and gave their lives in our struggle for freedom and those who
strove to safeguard this Independence. But this land is not a land of tears.
Today is the day when we are proud of the fact that we did not let our
vision become blurred because of tears, nor did we succumb to our
injuries. We have gone ahead, overcoming all dangers and difficulties,
whether in our struggle against alien rule, or in the struggle to safeguard
our borders, or in the struggle that we are waging today against poverty,
economic backwardness and injustice. India has a tradition of overcoming
its sorrows and marching forward with determination.
       Today all of us-- the farmers, the labourers, the unemployed, the
womenfolk, the Scheduled Caste people and the backward classes, the
tribal people-- all those who are still not fully within reach of the fruits of
freedom, and industrialization and modernity, all are together in this
struggle. If we have not been successful completely in our goals it is not
because the desire was not there or the effort was not there, but because
such gigantic tasks cannot be accomplished through magic or in a day. No
matter how high we set our goals and how hard we try, such things take
their own time. But if we remain united and show the same determination
that we did during our struggle for Independence or that we do at times of
external aggression, we can certainly make quicker progress in our battle
against poverty.
       But I am sad to say that this determination is not always manifest.
When we were under alien rule they exploited our greatest weakness. They
tried somehow or the other to create dissensions among us either in the
name religion or on some other grounds. Thus they sought to sow the
seeds of disunity and weaken our fight for Independence which we carried
on through peaceful means under the leadership of Gandhiji. But we did
not become victims of their machinations. There were occasional riots and
disturbances, but generally we progressed along our chosen path.
        When we set forth on a journey, we come across all types of roads
and paths. Some are wide, others are narrow and we have to select the
path along which we want to move forward. There are not many ways open
to a country like ours which was poverty-stricken and oppressed, at times
beset with fears. In fact, we have only one path open to us, the path of
unity. We tried to create a society which would not fear oppression or
succumb to suffering. There are many sitting before me who were born
after the advent of Independence and who cannot even imagine the
humiliations we had to go through and the poverty that prevailed. Today we
still have poverty in the country, but together with this the middle class has
grown in strength and in numbers too. There is some unemployment today
but many people have also gained opportunities for better employment.
The more we progress, the more such opportunities will increase.
     Earlier, we had to stretch our hands to beg for food, but today we
produce enough food. But this is not enough. With the increase in
population, we need more land for cultivation, more grains, more education,
and more health services. Things which we could not even dream of
earlier, have become necessities today for every person and every family.
Our effort is to see that whatever little we have is so distributed that no one
suffers. People may have a little less but there should be no injustice.
      Today, who are our enemies? It may be that we have external
enemies and will have them in future, too. Then, like many other countries,
we have poverty and economic backwardness as our common enemy. But
what was it that weakened India in the first place because of which we lost
our Independence? The same thing exists today, which can, and is,
weakening the country. It is divisiveness in the name of religion and
language, as also provincialism and casteism. I ask you, my brothers, my
sisters and dear children, which country has been able to progress without
unity and hard work? We want our defence forces to be strong. Why? Not
to launch an attack on others, but to defend our own borders, to keep our
country safe. We want that our industries should flourish, our agricultural
production should grow, employment opportunities should increase, as also
the production of those goods which can help raise our living standards and
provide comfort and happiness.
      We are a peace-loving nation and want that a peaceful atmosphere
should prevail not only in our country but in the entire world. But when will
this be possible! Only when rumour mongering and injustices are curbed.
We know that there are cases of injustice, oppression and corruption. But
what is the way to overcome these? Can a weak government launch a
struggle against these forces? Can a government which itself is constantly
under attack, keep safe the interests of the poor and of the minorities? Can
a weak government build a country which can raise its head with pride in
the world? Today the time has come to create a strong government, a
strong nation. Of course, the time was always there but today this need is
being felt all the more because dangers have increased all over the world.
The dangers and the difficulties which we, specially the poorer and the
economically backward nations, are trying to overcome, are existent more
or less throughout the world.
      Even the richest and the strongest of nations are facing the problems
of unemployment and inflation. In those countries too the economic
situation is not satisfactory. I have had the opportunity of visiting many
countries. From other countries which I or my ministers have not been able
to visit, we constantly receive reports. Today all countries are worried. And
the greatest worry is about the direction in which the human community is
heading after having extended its limits of knowledge and ability. Are we
heading for suicide and annihilation of this beautiful earth of ours? This is
the question which is facing more and more people today. In world capitals
and important towns there is a movement on the subject and people are
thinking, writing and speaking about it.
      There are three big dangers. One is the amassing of the worst kinds
of weapons which can destroy the human species, entire cities and lands.
Second, the gap between the rich and the poor nations continues to widen.
The gap between the rich and the poor exists in our country and in other
poor countries also. This is a fact we do not seek to conceal. At least we
are trying to establish a socialistic pattern of society and socialism itself
means that this difference between the rich and the poor should diminish,
that equality should prevail in society and that the fruits of Independence
should reach each individual and every family. The third danger is that
because of greed we continue to exploit the natural resources of the earth
like mining coal and extracting oil without giving a thought to what effect
such acts will have on the coming generations.
       We are proud of being Indians not because India is far more beautiful
or better than other countries. Wherein then lies her greatness? What is
that inherent quality which has seen her flourish through centuries and
ages and which has given our poor people strength and capability? It is
essentially the high ideals of our ancient tradition. Our country may have
made mistakes, but we have always set ourselves lofty goals. We have
thought not merely in terms of India's unity but have viewed all issues in the
context of humanity as a whole.
     India has had a tradition of peace and tolerance: tolerance not only
towards fellow-men but even towards animals and plants. This has been
our tradition, whether you look at the teachings of the Buddha or those of
the Sikh Gurus. You know how Emperor Asoka propagated his teachings of
peace throughout the country and how Akbar brought together peoples of
different religions and profited from their teachings. Such things have given
our country inherent strength.
       Our Independence Day also coincides with the birth anniversary of
Sri Aurobindo. Where else in the world can you find the example of a
revolutionary believing in violence giving up the violent path and turning to
spiritualism, all the while retaining his love for his country and seeking out
ways to increase the inherent strength and morale of the nation? Then
there was Gandhiji who assimilated the best of various religions and forged
the weapon of peace, friendship and a sense of brotherhood to fight for our
Independence. We were fighting our battle for Independence but not with
guns and cannons. Our weapons were unity and patriotism, and our
dedication and determination to achieve the goal. Have we lost these
weapons today? Does that sense of patriotism exist no more? Are we no
more prepared to make sacrifices? I see many children sitting in front of
me, and many young men must be listening at this moment to my voice. I
call
upon all of them to join hands and be one in their patriotism to strengthen
our nation. Those who exploit religion, caste, language and provincialism
for political gains do not have the welfare of the nation at heart. There are
people who imagine that progress can be achieved only through violence.
This gets their names into the newspapers and creates a little stir. But we
have to ask ourselves whether we want our names in print or we want to
strengthen the country and work for its progress. Now is the time for you to
choose your path. I am confident that our children, our elders who
participated in the freedom struggle, and those who fought in times of
external aggression, will give evidence of the old spirit of unity and
strength.
       Today we have to reinforce the ancient values of India. We are
citizens of India and we should not do anything, say anything and even
think anything that lowers the prestige of Mother India. We all have a
tremendous responsibility cast on us, not only towards ourselves but also
towards future generations. India is not a country which has been in
existence for five or ten or a 100 years. Her history goes back to thousands
of years and it will continue to exist for thousands more. If we have to make
sacrifices today for the sake of a better future, I call upon you to make
those sacrifices and render the necessary services. I have full confidence
that no matter what ideology we subscribe to, and whatever political or
other differences we may have, we will all be one when it comes to being
soldiers for India. We do not don uniforms. We respect those who do and
we take pride in them. But we too are soldiers, no less, in the fight for
India's progress. With this in view, I once again entreat you to stand united,
to remain strong, and overcome difficulties with a cheer and a smile. We
want our beautiful country to be even more beautiful, and should cleanse it
of all dirt whether it is the dirt in the street, the dirt in our houses or in our
hearts. Everybody has to voluntarily accept his own responsibility. We have
a habit of blaming others. Let each one of us ask ourselves whether we are
doing the right thing or not and whether we are prepared to exert ourselves
to the utmost to check those who are doing the wrong things. If the
humblest of our citizens, and also the most important, think about these
problems, realize their own responsibilities and change accordingly, will not
the entire society change, and with this, will not the entire nation change?
This is a question which every one of us has to address to his own heart.
      I once again felicitate you on this happy day and call upon you to be
prepared for every suffering, every risk and every obstacle so that we can
bring about a united India which can hold its head high in the community of
nations."
1981,Indira Gandhi,INC,"Call for Unity, Discipline and Hard Work","Free rendering of the Independence Day speech delivered in Hindi from the Red Fort, Delhi, August 15, 1981",Selected Speeches of Indira Gandhi: January 1980-December 1981,NA,"Today again is the birthday of Free India. I greet you all. We come
here every year to unfurl the flag. This is no mere ritual or custom; it is a
duty.
       This is the day when we recall those years when people of all
religions, all castes, all languages, all States, rich and poor, women and
men, old and young, were all one and united. What was our slogan? 'We
may lose our head but India must become free'. To achieve this goal we did
not care for the insults and humiliations inflicted on us, and, put into our
freedom struggle all our physical, material and moral resources. Many
families were ruined, many lakhs of people sacrificed their lives and many
jails were filled. In this Red Fort itself, there were prisoners who had
passed through the jaws of death. There is no village in India which does
not have its own saga of courage and bravery of its people. Today, we
remember all that and pay our homage to those freedom fighters whether
they were in our peaceful and non-violent movement or whether they
followed other paths. Today we have to tell these old accounts of freedom
struggle specially to our younger generation, because it is from that seed
that the New India is sprouting. The plant is still frail, we have to nurse it
with our sweat and hard labour, and with all the care make it grow just as
we plant trees to make India green.
      I had spoken from this place a year ago. During this year, like in other
years, you have faced many difficulties. Your problems are known to me
and I view them not only as a Prime Minister but also as a woman and a
mother. But, if there were problems and difficulties- and they exist also-
there were successes and achievements too. APPLE, which was
inaugurated yesterday, is one such achievement. For the first time, through
this satellite APPLE, not only those who are present here but lakhs of
others in different parts of the country are able to listen and watch today's
function and thus participate in it. This is not a small achievement for a
nation which only a few years back was enmeshed in the mire of
colonialism.
      You may ask that if we can perform such big tasks for which we are
all proud and happy and congratulate our scientists and engineers, why is it
that we do not accomplish other lesser jobs? Why cannot we control
prices? This is a moot question. The prices are still high and I know the
difficulties you face, specially my sisters who have to run the homes. I
would, however, like to tell you that though prices have not come down, the
rate of increase in prices has certainly been controlled to some extent and
the situation is improving gradually. There are many reasons for the rise in
prices. One is less production and we are engaged in increasing it. But
another reason is-- we have some selfish people in our country, as
elsewhere also, who try to take advantage out of such problems. In trying
to satisfy their self-interest, they forget the overall interest of the country.
Even today, hoarding, blackmarketing and profiteering are going on,
because those who indulge in these anti-social activities had received
encouragement a few years back and have still not come into our net.
Although in some areas there has been some impact of the action taken by
us, it is still not as much as it should have been. People demand from us as
to why we do not take stern measures. But, if we try to take even slight stiff
steps, so many obstacles come in the way. Some steps have been taken
and these have had some effect; more such measures will certainly be
taken against the anti-social elements.
      Some shortages occurred because of the nature and the weather and
sometimes even because of our mistakes. However, we are making an all
out effort to increase production. In fact, agricultural production has gone
up. As you all know, agricultural production this year has been exceedingly
good. You may ask: If wheat production has gone up, why are we importing
wheat? This is because here, in the country, an effort is being made by
some people to purchase and hoard it with a view to raising the prices later.
This may cause suffering to many people, especially the poorest or those
who live in remote areas. This is why, even though we did not need it
immediately, we made the purchase as wheat was available easily and at
low prices abroad. As one should be prepared all the time to face
problems, we took this step so that we may protect our people from
difficulties.
     There has been increase in industrial production also. Our emphasis
has been to improve the infrastructure on which depends all production,
progress and development, whether of the farmers or of the factories.
There has thus been growth in energy, coal and rail transport system
though we have not been able to accomplish all that is needed.
      In these years, there has been considerable improvement in social
services like health, education and others. Even then it is not enough and
we cannot reach them to the people. Why? Because, while these services
increase, our population increases at a still faster rate. So, whatever may
be the number of new schools, colleges and universities, and, howsoever
many new hospitals and dispensaries are opened, the number of people
who need them is always more.
       Whether it is a question of inflation or population or any other
question, the job cannot be completed unless there is fullest co-operation
from all of you. The Government has heavy responsibility which, through
your vote, you have entrusted it with; but in a democracy the ordinary
citizen also has an equal amount of duties. The atmosphere gets vitiated if
people are spendthrift and keep on buying things whatever may be the
price and whether they need a thing or not. I would even say that in these
difficult times anyone who acts against the interest of the society acts
against the nation. How to check these elements? Laws and rules are
made but they cannot always be fully implemented because it is not for the
government alone to implement them. At different levels, many people
contribute to complete this work and the slightest lapse anywhere can
dislocate the entire programme and the policy. We want your co-operation
in this also. I do not mean in the least that you take law in your hands. I
want to say that you should create such an atmosphere in the society that
people who want to do wrong things are not able to prosper and are
identified and made to feel ashamed before others. If you create such an
atmosphere, you will see how quickly the situation can be reformed.
       Whatever we do now, like this purchase of wheat from abroad, some
people raise their voices against it. Who are behind them? Voices are
raised by people because they are provoked to do so by others. What are
the forces behind them? It is these forces that want that the prices of
foodgrains should go up in the market, not that the farmers should get a
higher price.
       There are many such things which either get stuck in the courts or
some other obstacles come in the way, because of which they remain
unresolved and get delayed. We have to create a new atmosphere in our
society so that everybody may understand his duties. Like the freedom
fighters I just mentioned, all of you have also to act as soldiers to safeguard
the freedom. You have to involve yourself in this task with the same spirit of
sacrifice and service. This is not someone else's work, not of any
Government or of any political party only. This is the work of the country, of
the common citizen of India, of the poor, of the backward, of the middle
class, in fact, of all the people. In the conditions of today some people may
earn profits, but if the country does not become strong, they will not benefit
from profits for long; they will not be able to remain happy for long. We
have to keep all these matters in view.
       In today's world, not only in our country but in other countries also,
wherever I have gone or where others have gone and have described the
situation, we find there is violence, crime and lawlessness everywhere. We
are not concerned with what happens in other countries, although it does
influence the situation here. We have to see that we bring about
improvement in our own attitudes. We should spread our own humanism
and bring back again basic moral values in the society, which is the
foundation of all religions, from which not only we, in India, but I think, the
entire humanity has departed to take a wrong road. With all this wisdom,
knowledge and capability, instead of using it for good causes, how is this
power being used? We see that big powers are using their resources not in
development work, not in helping the poor, but in increasing their
armaments - bigger and bigger and more sophisticated ones. What for? For
the annihilation of people, or, destruction of houses, farms and fields or
nations. This is being done knowingly by the human race. Is it the path
India should follow? Time has come when every Indian must consider this
matter in depth and understand his responsibility.
       Before we tell others anything, we have to set things right in our own
home. In this country where peace used to prevail, where people always
lived together amicably — though sometimes small quarrels take place why
do disturbances take place on petty matters, sometimes in the name of
languages? These are the things which come in the way of our progress
and development. We have to remove these from our path. If there is any
cause behind it we have to find it and root it out. We have to create an
atmosphere in which no impediment comes in the way of our development
and progress. This is the message of our Independence Day, this year and
every year.
      We have reached one stage in our progress, but the journey is still
very long. Stockpile of armaments is increasing all around us, posing
increasing danger not only to India but to the entire region and, I think, to
the whole world. When there is danger, everybody suffers but burden falls
more on those who are poor and have shortage of resources, commodities,
money or the like. Therefore, while others have to be vigilant anyway, we
Indians have to be more vigilant and alert.
       We have to give a new direction to our society. We have to learn
many things from our history and heritage. If there are superstitions or
other evils, we should not have the least hesitation to remove them. We
have to develop our own strength. Everyone has his share of problems and
difficulties, individuals as well as countries. You all know what I have
suffered as a mother, but, for me much bigger is my duty towards you who
are like my children. And, that is why these things can hold back neither me
nor you. Time waits for none. Our children are growing, whether you help
them or not. Their's and other people's demands are increasing, and rightly
so, because if some people are getting things, why not the others — the
poor and the backward.
     At this time, all of us must develop the feelings of unity and strength.
We have always strived for friendship with our neighbouring countries and
others. But, when they spurned and attacked us, we did face the
aggression with courage. And, I congratulate and express gratefulness
again on your behalf to our jawans and officers of the Defence Forces for
the way in which they kept our borders secure, and, I know they will
continue to do so. But our effort is that there should be no war; there should
be friendship with our neighbours and with far-off countries. Nobody need
consider it as our weakness. It is not because of any weakness; we do it for
the sake of our ideals. It is our effort that those ideals should guide our
country.
      It is our policy that all regions of the country should progress and
develop — including the hill regions, the desert areas and the people living
in the forests. In the Five Year Plan, there are schemes for everyone —
farmers, workers, students, harijans, adivasis, poor people and those
belonging to middle class. Millions of new opportunities for employment will
open up for people and I have confidence that our youth will take full
advantage of them. They will also, I am sure, find new avenues for
self-employment. It has been our constant effort to push forward schemes
that are beneficial to the farmers and the workers.
       There was some misunderstanding because recently an Ordinance
was issued which prevents strikes in essential public services. I want to
assure the workers that this Ordinance is not against them. It has never
been our intention and we will never do anything to suppress them or
create difficulties for them in any way. But it is necessary that the public
services are kept going, not because that these are governmental
programmes, but because it is in the interest of the good of the country.
These things are required by the common man, and are needed for the
strength and security of the nation. Workers have always discharged their
responsibilities and I have confidence that they and our farmers, our
intellectuals and other sections will continue to discharge their
responsibilities.
      Today is a special day, being Raksha-Bandhan. This is not a religious
festival. It is a social festival for cordiality and for friendship. This is the day
when people extend their hands of friendship. What for? For protecting
each other. On this day we seek the co-operation of all countries in
maintaining peace and in protecting the humanity. To our own countrymen,
we say that they should celebrate this day not only in the manner of
brother-sister relationship but see how they can protect Mother india, how
the unity in the country could be further strengthened and how each
individual can be a protector of the nation.
       Earlier, I had told you about a slogan. Now I want to say that the flag
under which we are standing is not just a piece of cloth. This is a symbol of
the sacrifices made in our struggle for freedom, later, of the sacrifices by
our brave soldiers on our borders in various wars, and now of those who
with their hard labour are engaged in the struggle for India's progress, and
also of our promising youth. Our flag and our National Anthem are no
ordinary things. They unite the country and bind it together. That is why I
want to say that 'the glory of the flag must be protected even at the cost of
life'."
1980,Indira Gandhi,INC,At a Turning Point,"Free rendering of the Independence Day speech delivered in Hindi from the Red Delhi, August 15, 1980",Selected Speeches of Indira Gandhi: January 1980-December 1981,NA,"After a few years I have again the privilege to unfurl our dear national
flag from this historic place.
      This should have been an occasion for rejoicing, but my heart is full
of sorrow. The incident which has taken place in Moradabad, not very far
from here, has inflicted an injury to our country. Our sympathies are with
the families of all those who have died or have been injured or have
suffered in some way. On behalf of all of you I offer my sympathies to them.
I should like to say that whoever has played mischief or is guilty, whether
he is an official or a non-official, will be very severely punished. At the
same time, I urge upon you that we should not allow the feeling of
communalism, casteism or of revenge to spread.
      It is the duty of everyone, in every city or village, to use all our energy
to maintain peace and law and order. The poison of communalism has
been there in our society for many years. We had thought that the
martyrdom of Gandhiji had eliminated this poison but we see how easily it
bursts out again.
       You know that from my childhood I have been taught that special
attention should be given to the weaker sections in our country- whether
they are weak because of their numbers or because of poverty and
backwardness. Our first duty is to protect them, help them and to raise
them up, because only then can there be peace in our society. We have all
to get on to this task. We have to think why these things, which had been
controlled or were in check, have again emerged, particularly during the
last three years. Besides communalism, casteism has surfaced in a
powerful manner. There must be some conspiracy and some kind of effort
that on every issue there is some agitation or some clash or violence, so
that no work is done.
       Violence and lawlessness have spread all over the country. If we do
not succeed in putting a stop to it, we shall not be able to accomplish
anything. It is like a river which breaks its banks and overflows in every
direction. Its water then can be of little use or beneficence. It can only
cause harm to the people. Such is the present state of affairs. Such groups
were encouraged and a climate was created in the country so that no could
grab anything they could get.
     We know that in a poor and backward country everybody has
demands to make. Some of these can be just demands, the people need
those things. But the question is how the demands should be put forward.
Can agitatations, which impose burdens on others, take our country
forward? And if the country cannot march forward, then how can the
demands be satisfied?
      We have to stop this lawlessness. We have to remove the
weaknesses that have crept in at every level, not only among the youth, but
in the entire society and in the administration.
      We find that the discipline, the spirit of working together, the spirit of
marching together, the spirit of sacrifice and the spirit of service which were
there earlier have disappeared now. People say that so many months have
gone by but nothing has been done, but when water is spilt, can it again be
collected easily? I assure you that it is my earnest endeavour to bring about
improvement in the administration so that it may accomplish its tasks with
dedication, patriotism, courage and speed.
       Corruption has gone up and I am amazed at the extent of its increase
at every level. We must root it out, whether it is in bureaucracy or in politics,
whether it is in high places or low. Whoever it may be, we have to check
this vigorously so that the instruments for implementing our policies are
sharpened and take our programmes forward.
      One of our main tasks is to see how to strengthen the services,
whose duty it is to protect society. They should be enabled to do their work
better and win the confidence and friendship of the people.
     We are not unaware of the difficulties which we are facing today.
There is the problem of Assam, where a powerful agitation has been going
on.
     I regard the children and students of Assam as my own children. I
have sympathy for them. It is our earnest effort to remove their difficulties
which are genuine and have substance. But I would also tell them that it is
not correct to hold the country to ransom and cause suffering to the nation.
I believe that there are some sections, small in number but determined to
do mischief, who want to take undue advantage of this agitation or for that
matter any agitation anywhere else.
       At some places, anti-social elements come to the surface; at others,
anti-national elements raise their heads. If this evil, this poison, however
small, is not combated it can spread and cause great damage. I have no
doubt that the people of Assam and other parts of the country will not allow
this poison to spread and will bravely fight the evil forces, agitation or no
agitation.
      Prices have risen and I know fully well the agonies of our people,
particularly the difficulties and burdens on housewives and on women. But
you also know the reasons why prices have gone up.
      The prices of some commodities like oil, diesel and fertilizers are not
wholly in our hands. But there are other commodities the prices of which
should be under check. But how can the prices come down if there are
agitations, if so much of money has to be spent on maintaining law and
order and on fulfilling the demands of some sections of the people?
      I appeal to you all, to the entire society, to sisters and brothers, to old
and young, to realize that they also have some responsibility in the matter.
Of course, it is the responsibility of the traders at this time not to take
advantage of the difficulties and the helplessness of the people. It is also
the responsibility of the people not to buy non-essential goods. Each in his
own way should see what he can do in this direction.
       If something improper is being done, if the ration shop is not being
run properly, or if the traders are raising prices without reason, people
should see what they can do. I can assure them that the government will
fully co-operate with them in this task. But unless there is full backing of the
people, this rampant evil cannot be easily curbed.
      At the same time there is no problem which we cannot solve if you
help and co-operate. If we had recorded some achievements earlier, it was
not because of any outside support, but because of the support and
co-operation you gave us. We were able to consolidate the nation's power
and did not allow it to be frittered away. You and we were thus able to
achieve some remarkable things.
     If agricultural production or industrial production increased, it was
because of the sweat and labour of the Indian people. Today, we have
again to revive the spirit of working hard.
      The farmers of India are our very backbone. The country cannot
survive without them, nor can we achieve self-reliance.
      Cultivators are today in distress because of rising prices and the
shortage of some inputs. We are trying our best to help them in every
possible way.
      After the terrible drought of last year, the rains have been fairly good
so far this year. This has brought some relief. But many people have
suffered because of floods. I offer my sympathies to the flood-affected
people.
      We have to increase the agriculture production in all possible ways so
that our needs are met and foodgrains and other essential commodities are
taken to the people in remote areas, whether they live in mountains, in
forests or in deserts.
      Similarly, industrial workers constitute the foundation of a modern
nation. We can help our agriculture and strengthen the country only if our
factories are kept running and industrial production goes up.
      Our problems are many. But India is not the only country which faces
an economic crisis. It is a world-wide phenomenon. Even the bigger nations
are facing all the problems that we face. But this is no excuse for us.
       No single country or a group of countries can help us. We have got to
stand on our own feet and march towards the goal of self-reliance. And I
think that one of the major causes of the lack of discipline and selfishness
that we see around us is that we have given up the tried and tested path
during the last three years. Our basic policies and objectives and our ideals
which had inspired us to march forward were repudiated and new ways
were sought out. We would have understood if they did find a new way, but
they went in different directions. This was the reason why all those who had
come together broke up and our speed slowed down.
       Wherever there is poverty and backwardness, internal danger is
always present; but, today there is external danger also. You are not
unaware of the state of affairs around our country, of the massive arms
build-up that it going on. Earlier, the danger came only from one or two
directions; but today the vast ocean is also full of all kinds of military
concentrations. So the peril to us has further aggravated.
      Our policy has always been that of friendship and it will continue to be
so. We extend our hand of friendship, especially towards our neighbouring
countries. The Government and the people of India know very well that
nothing comes out of confrontation. It is only through co-operation and
friendship that everyone can solve problems and help each other.
      Whosoever tries to weaken us, puts pressure on us or is hostile to us.
we shall face them unitedly, not through weapons, not through war, but on
the basis of our strength, our stability, our unity and our ideals.
       It has been our desire to show to the world that the countries of the
entire sub-continent and those outside can live together and work together.
But again, there is confrontation between countries. As I said earlier, no
one can help a country as large as India. We have to stand on our own
feet. Any help can at best be marginal. If we fall, nobody can lift us. We
have to rise ourselves.
      Our country can ensure its security on its own. It cannot depend on
others. This is why we lean neither towards this country nor that, neither
towards this bloc nor that bloc.
      We are Indians and India is our concern. The building up of India is
our endeavour. Whatever is our policy, whatever is our direction and
whatever steps or programmes we undertake, they are all designed only to
make the people of India strong and to raise them above poverty and
backwardness. This is our only objective.
      I wish to assure our neighbouring countries that our people desire
friendship with them. We do not want war. We know that there cannot be
agreement on everything. There are bound to be differences among
nations as among individuals. But wherever there is similarity of views, we
should help each other, work together and co-operate with each other. If
we are prepared to do that, much of our expenditure could be cut down and
we can become stronger. But if anybody threatens us, we are prepared for
it.
       Present here amidst us today are the brave jawans of our three
Services. No praise is too high for them. They are constantly engaged in
the service of people, whether in war or peace. We, the citizens of India,
are also soldiers of a kind, whether we put on a uniform or not. It is our duty
to further strengthen our defence forces through unity among ourselves.
      I see before me a large number of children, the hope and promise of
India. What kind of future do we want to build for them? We have to work
today for that future. If our young men, our farmers and workers, our
middle-class and housewives and people of other professions get lost in
the worries of the day and cannot come out of the present day crisis, how
shall we march forward and complete the journey?
        More than 28 crore people of our country were born after
Independence. They have no conception of the appalling poverty that
existed in India before Independence, the insults and indignities which were
inflicted upon Indian citizens, our religion and our culture. Almost a
miraculous change has taken place during these years.
      All our problems have not been solved but, one by one, many
problems have also been set right. If your co-operation is forthcoming,
many more will be solved.
     When our Government was formed, I had said, “Let us forget what
happened in the past. Let us again be united.” We may have different
policies and cannot adopt identical programmes. At the same time, no
obstacles should be created in the way of building up of the nation.
      Democracy can function only when the Government and the
Opposition parties accept each other and try to work in harmony. This does
not mean that the Opposition has no right to oppose. That right is inherent
in a democracy. But no attempt should be made to stop the functioning of
the Government.
      Who suffers—the Government or the people—when work stops? And
when the people suffer, the worst hit are the poor, particularly the women.
Who will suffer if the schools and colleges are closed? Certainly the
children whose years of education are wasted. We should consider all this.
      We are at a turning point in the life of our country. Either we gain all
or we lose all. Of course, it is the responsibility of the Government to
implement programmes but it is equally up to the Opposition parties and
also to you who are citizens of India. We should understand these
problems.
      During our freedom struggle, we marched forward unitedly and in a
disciplined fashion. We had then no thought of our own selves, nor of our
demands. Were there no demands then? Was there no agony or suffering
when we were fighting for independence? There were few employment
opportunities in those days. Availability of goods was meagre, people were
pushed around and there was discrimination against us in our own
railways. But Gandhiji turned all the suppressed and illiterate people into a
strong force which shook the entire world. That power is still within us. Only
a fraction of that power is represented at the Red Fort today and the rest—
the vast masses of the people are spread in the four corners of the country.
      We are a powerful force, a force for culture, a force for wisdom of the
kind hardly seen in any other country. Shall we fritter away this asset? We
have a precious heritage. Shall we throw it away? We have to consider all
this.
      Our goal is to make India great. We want to make India strong. We
do not ask for anything from the world. All we seek is peace. All we seek is
to strengthen our freedom. All we want is to establish true democracy in our
country— democracy not for the few but for the poorest of the poor, so that
their problems are solved, so that they can have two full meals a day and
be usefully employed and preserve their self-respect.
       It is these things we want for our country. Only when we are able to
provide these things can we say that the vow which our leaders had taken,
the pledge Jawaharlal Nehru took for the first time at this spot under this
flag, has been fulfilled.
      Independence, the dream which Gandhiji shared with us and said we
should do or die to reach it, has been realized. But we have to go ahead. If
we stand together, there is no task which we cannot accomplish, no
problem that we cannot solve and no danger that we cannot face.
     I call upon you once again to rise and march ahead. We have fallen
down sometimes, we may fall down again, but we shall rise and move
forward and reach our destination.
      Brothers and sisters, I appeal to you again to look to the future and
not to the present. The future of India, your future, is bright and shining.
Sometimes its very glitter can dazzle our vision, but we have to move
forward to that glorious future and raise our country to a much higher plane."
1979,Charan Singh,Janata Party,Pledge to go ahead,"Independence Day speech from the ramparts of the Red Fort, New Delhi, 15 August 1979","Charan Singh, selected speeches, July 1979-December 1979",NA,"We are today celebrating the thirty second anniversary of our
Independence. It was through the sacrifice and endeavour of Mahatma
Gandhi and other leaders that the country won its Independence after 200
years of British rule. On this occasion, it is proper that we pay our homage
to the Father of the Nation and other colleagues. However, just paying
homage will not be enough.
       The recent change in the Central Government was brought about in a
peaceful and democratic manner. A variety of things are said by people in
this regard. They say this is an SVD Government and ask how will it run?
But I would like to tell you that the Janata Government also was an SVD
Government. It had one label and yet it was an SVD Government with
many constituents. I would not go into details but would only mention that
some persons tried to discard the ladder with the help of which they had
stepped up to the seat of power. I had publicly expressed my disagreement
with my closest ally, Shri Raj Narain, on 24th of June. But the events that
took place after that forced me and my colleagues to leave that SVD
Government. Today, the Congress, the Janata (S) and our friends in the
Socialist Party, the Peasants and Workers Party of Maharashtra and the
Communist Party members, who had expressed themselves in favour of
this Government in the last week of July, together have a strength of 200
and more; call it SVD or what you like. The day, the other people or the
parties or leaders are able to form a larger party and challenge us and the
moment we feel that we are in a minority, we will not hesitate even for a
minute to step down.
      I and my colleagues do not want a mid-term poll which is very
expensive and creates lot of problems. But I think, no party wants a
mid-term poll. If, however, we have to go in for one, we will come to you to
seek your vote and confidence. I have every hope that in that event, the
Congress, the Janata(S) and other partners, I have mentioned, will be able
to form a united party which will be able to secure majority throughout the
country.
     Among the number of problems facing this country, the most serious
is poverty. Of the 125 nations of the world, our position is 111th which
means that there are 110 countries which are more affluent than us. Three
years ago, our position was 104th and during this period we have slided
down to the 111th position. This speaks of the level of our poverty.
      The second problem is of unemployment. From the time the Janata
Party took up the reins of power, 25 lakh more young unemployed have
registered their names with the Employment Exchanges. Unemployment
thus is on the increase. In the rural areas, both the educated and
uneducated are unemployed. In the cities too, the educated unemployed
are on the streets. Therefore, we have to eradicate unemployment.
       The third problem, we face in the economic field is the growing
disparity between the poor and the affluent. This disparity existed even at
the time of the British. In a small measure, this disparity exists everywhere
and it will be impossible to erase it completely. But that Government alone
will be considered good which minimises this disparity instead of letting it
increase further. Since Independence, in our country the gap between the
rich and the poor has increased and economic power is getting
concentrated in the hands of a few people.
Besides, social tensions also persist. I would not like to go into the reasons
for this. But the poor, the Harijans and the weaker sections are not feeling
secure. The minorities, that is the followers of religions other than Hindu,
have also begun to sense similar tension. The reasons may be historic and
need not be elaborated just now. It will be the endeavour of this
Government to eliminate the root causes of these continuing tensions and
establish peace and prosperity in the country. We will be deemed to have
succeeded only if no communal riots are reported for one year or for the
tenure of this Government.
      Friends, one immediate problem before us is price rise. In the last two
Five Year Plans, investment for cement, coal and power production was
meagre and in the last six months of the Janata Government, that is from
January to June 1979, these sectors were handled indifferently. Coal,
power, rail movement are critical sectors which have an impact on the total
economy. In addition, there have been strikes and ships held-up at ports
unloaded for as long as one month and even 45 days. The result of all this
has been the rise in price level. This Government and my colleagues in the
Departments will make every effort to see that production increases. They
will not be confining themselves to Delhi, they will go to the power plants
and to the coal mines.
      As long as production does not increase and the prices keep going
up, this country will never be able to progress.
      Another thing to be noted is that the prices of even such commodities
as foodgrains etc., which are not in short supply are also increasing. In this
connection I would appeal to the retail and wholesale traders that they
should desist from being greedy and earning profits which will only hurt our
people and our country. We are determined not to allow black-marketing
and profiteering that has continued so far; we will not permit it to continue
further.
      Friends, all of us know which sections of our people deserve
Government help most. But before I go into that, I would like to tell that
despite the rise in prices of certain commodities, we are not short of food
grains; our warehouses are full and for that, we should be grateful to the
farmers. The farmers will continue to work hard, even if the rainfall is scanty
or there is no rain. Therefore, so far as foodgrains are concerned, the
country will not face any shortage. Another silver lining is that we have no
shortage of foreign exchange and this can help us import things needed by
the country.
      I was referring to the sections which deserve greater attention from
the Government— the harijans, the tribals, the landless, the unemployed or
underemployed and 50 percent of our farmers who have got an hectare or
less of land. These poorer sections have so far been neglected and the
Government will pay special attention to them. According to the latest
estimates of the Planning Commission, 48 percent of those living below the
poverty line are in the villages and 41 percent in the towns. These are the
ones, who do not get even frugal meals to feed themselves. You can ask a
question as to why there is hunger when our silos are full of foodgrains.
The reason is that they do not have the purchasing power. Even if there is
plenty of food around, a man will remain hungry if he does not have the
money to buy it. Therefore, the Government will pay the utmost attention to
the poor and the hungry, 41 percent of whom live behind the big palaces
and bungalows in the cities and 48 percent of whom live in the villages. If
we can not give them the attention they deserve, the Government will not
be fit to remain in power.
      It will be our endeavour that everyone in the country finds
employment. For this, we have to pay special attention for increasing
agricultural production and establishing cottage and village industries.
When the Britisher's came here first, 25 percent of our population was
engaged in such industries. Today, despite big plants and factories, only 9
percent of the population is engaged in industries. Therefore, despite lakhs
of cars and large number of skyscrapers in Bombay and Delhi and the
number of people who have televisions and radio sets, I feel that we are
today, poorer and weaker than the time of Jahangir and Aurangzeb.
       To my friends in the cities, I would say that I am not inclined to
answer the criticism appearing in the newspapers or the comments that
various people make. I would like to say only that trade, transport and
industries can develop only when there is purchasing power with the
people. If the villagers, the unemployed and the poor do not have the
purchasing power, our industries will not be able to develop and the country
will not be able to attain affluence. Only that country is considered affluent
which has a larger percentage of people engaged in non-agricultural
occupations. In our country, however, only 10 percent of the population
was engaged in industries in 1951 and this percentage remained static in
1961 and again in 1971. Industry cannot grow unless agriculture also
develops. There is no other way. We will, therefore, attempt to encourage
cottage and village industries in the rural areas.
      Our womenfolk today break stones on the roads. What were their
forefathers engaged in? They were independently engaged in small
industries or were craftsmen. These crafts were lost during the time of
British and we too continue to be indifferent in this respect. Our emphasis,
therefore, will be to establish cottage industries in the villages. We will also
strive to increase farm production. It will also be our endeavour to assist the
rural people to diversify to other occupations because prosperity cannot be
achieved if majority of our people continue to depend on land.
      I would like to draw your attention as well as the attention of my
colleagues and public workers to the teachings of Mahatma Gandhi.
Mahatmaji used to say that “ends don't justify means"". It is as though you
can adopt any means to achieve your objectives, howsoever noble. To be
able to achieve noble objectives, your means should also be equally noble.
You, and especially the public workers and all of us should keep in mind
this advice; otherwise we will not be able to root out corruption. Corruption
knows no bounds. A country where people are corrupt, will never be able to
progress whosoever may be the leader of the party or whatever be the
sound programme he might follow.
       Mahatmaji also used to say that for a public worker, there is no
private life different from his public life. To him, life is one and there is no
compartmentalisation. If man's public life is not clean, you can well imagine,
his private life cannot be any better either and he cannot truely serve the
country.
      The third thing, Gandhiji always emphasised and which we have
tended to forget, is that ""rights flow out of duties well performed”. All
around, you will find people asserting their rights, their demands to secure
better wages and allowances. This is all right. It is necessary that people
should have their rights but their rights emerge from their duties and
responsibilities. How do we get our rights if we do not carry out our duties?
There is need for hard work and enterprise. If you want to be prosperous,
you will have to put in hard work. You will pardon me, if I say that we are
not prepared to put in hard work. If you look at the other countries, you will
go that people start working in their factories, schools and offices at 8 in the
morning till 5 in the evening, getting a break of 40 minutes in between.
There are very few strikes. The emphasis there on demands is much less.
In Japan, if a worker is annoyed, he only bears a black band on his arm
and does not think in terms of striking work.
       If other countries have become prosperous, it is because they have
shown greater endeavour and enterprise. We want to earn more, have all
the comforts and enjoy life without having to pay the price for it, without
which nothing really in this world can be obtained, either by a person or by
a nation. If the West today is more affluent, if Japan and Israel where the
cows living in arid land, still give the world's best milk yield, are prosperous,
it is because of the hard work and enterprise of these countries. If our
country is to progress, we will have to put in hard work and show enterprise
and when I say that, I include myself and my ministers. Only through our
ceaseless hard work will this country be able to advance.
      Coming to the foreign policy, we continue to adhere to the old policy
of not aligning ourselves with any particular bloc. This will continue to be
our policy because we consider it to be beneficial to the country— we will
not be particularly inclined towards any country however big it might be. We
believe that in the world peace can be achieved and people can find
happiness only by following the preachings of Mahatma Gandhi. If not
today, the world will reach same conclusion the day after tomorrow.
       So far as the countries of South Asia are concerned, our relations
with them have improved, barring some cases, where too, we hope, there
will be improvement in our relations.
      In this connection I would like to mention our neighbour, Pakistan
whose people, till the other day, were part of us. Our information is that
Pakistan is trying to manufacture nuclear bomb. Against whom are they
making this bomb? They are friends with China; and with Russia they have
no disputes. As for Afghanistan, it is a small country and Pakistan has no
disputes with it either. If, therefore, I and my colleagues as also my
countrymen reach the conclusion that this bomb is aimed at us, is aimed at
India, then our conclusion will not be far from the truth.
      It has been our decision and it remains our decision so far that we do
not want to manufacture nuclear bombs, or join the race for nuclear
weapons. However, if Pakistan sticks to its decision and continues in its
efforts to manufacture the bomb or stockpiling of these bombs, I and my
colleagues will probably be forced to reconsider the entire question.
     With these words, I would like to appeal all those democratic forces,
who believe in secularism, to cast aside their petty differences, and come
forward to help me and my colleagues and my Government."
1978,Morarji Desai,Janata Party,A New Revolution,NA,"Prime Ministers of India's Independence Day and Other Speeches (Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru to Dr. Manmohan Sing), Vol 1. Edited by K.V. Singh. Vista International Publishing House, Delhi, India",NA,"Sixteen months have passed since the people gave the mandate to
the Janata Party to run the government. Last year when I addressed you
on the same day, I had spoken about the problems facing the country and
the tasks ahead. During the last one year from August 15, many things
have happened and are happening at home and abroad. The first task was
to restore the freedom of every citizen, the freedom of the press and the
independence of the judiciary. This has been done. These freedoms have
been restored. I have every faith that they will remain inviolate. It is
necessary that the people should be fearless, strong and dedicated, and
should do everything with the good of the country in mind.
      We have to work hard and get rid of many ills inherited from the past
and not only to regain but even excel the past glory of a happy and
prosperous India which had a place of honour in the world. It does not take
much time for weaknesses to creep in but it certainly takes time to remove
them. This has been my experience. But I have no doubt that we should try
to remove the ills as fast as we can. We cannot and should not rest till we
achieve our cherished ideals. We have to march forward together. It is only
then that we can accomplish the task.
     It is clear that things have improved in many ways. But even then
complaints are loudly voiced that prices have risen, and there is growing
unrest. But it is my experience that those who complain are the very people
who do nothing to improve matters but only worsen matters. On this day I
do not want to enter into any controversy about this as it may make our
task even more difficult. But one thing is clear : conditions on the price front
have not deteriorated. Prices which were going up for 10 years are not
rising now. It is also clear that the prices of some commodities have even
come down. We want the prices to come down further but unless prices of
all commodities come down, it will not benefit the growers and production
might fall. This general reduction should be our aim in every field and we
are engaging in this task.
      During the last 10 years our economic growth has been 2 per cent
but last year it was 5 per cent. We do not want to boast about this so long
as the progress does not satisfy everyone. But it is a fact that there has
been progress despite obstacles. For two years, the people were gagged,
their minds were almost closed and it was natural that when they got
freedom there should be some unusual activity. There have been strikes in
some industries. We have to find solutions for these. But whatever
solutions we find, we should keep in view the interest of the entire country,
and not of any particular section at the cost of others. We have to make
people understand this and only this way can we move forward.
       At some places people indulge in rowdyism and then blame the
government. It is true that the Government should look after this and we
are trying to do that. But whatever we do has to be according to the law
and cannot be autocratic. We have to take the people with us. This is the
path we are following, and we are getting results - good results. But I can
well understand that the people will not be satisfied unless results are
apparent in all spheres. Doubts arise in the public mind on many
occasions. I consider it the duty of every worker to remove the doubts. We
can make the progress that we want only if there is contentment and peace
in the country and every one feels that he should do nothing which might
harm the country or his neighbour. We are engaged in this task, the results
are coming and I am sure that soon we will be able to bring about a
situation when all of us will move forward together.
        But it so happens that our old ills crop up and create problems. It is a
matter of shame for all of us that there should be any atrocities on Harijans.
It is a disgrace for the country. But it is only by working together that we
can eradicate the ignorance and the evil which have entered our society
over the centuries. I have no doubt about this nor about the fact that we
have to take stern action against those who indulge in wrong deeds over
this matter. All of you must have heard of the incident outside my residence
the day before yesterday. It is a matter of shame for those who indulged in
such action. Unless they understand this they will continue doing these
wrong things. They had come to see me. They had assured the police that
they would be peaceful and would not disturb the peace. In the beginning,
they were somewhat peaceful. Five or six of them saw me. They said that
the land had been given to the Harijans and other backward poor, was
pasture land, and should be taken back and converted into pasture again.
This is what the farmers demanded. These grazing lands were given in
1970. There is some other land also in the grazing land. I do not agree that
his (giving of the land) has created any difficulty for anybody. But the
farmers insisted that these lands not be given to those people. A few
thousand people had gathered from nearby villages a few days ago and
had decided to create trouble. This trouble they created the day before.
       I told them I could not agree to their demands. The land had been
given to Harijans, it would remain with them and nobody could take it back.
This has to be understood clearly. They asked why were special privileges
given to Harijans? These privileges should be given to all the poor people
alike whether they were poor Harijans, Brahmins, Rajputs or others. I told
them that the Constitution gave certain privileges to Harijans because they
had suffered for centuries and for no fault of theirs had been forced to live
in a miserable condition. The responsibility was ours, of the entire society.
It was necessary to give them some privileges to remove their difficulties
and to enable them to live on par with others. They said the Constitution
must be amended. I said “How can you say this?"" Then they were angry
and they would have it done. I said ""if this is your decision and you are bent
on creating trouble, you please go. I will not talk to you"". They taken went
out and incited the people outside and what did they do? All of a sudden,
they became unruly. They had some lathis and arms with them when
forced police starting firing. But we must understand that if the crowd is
bent upon creating mischief, harms others and listens to no one, then there
is no way but to open fire. Nobody is happy to resort to firing. But it is for
the people to tell such element that so long as they indulge in such wrong
acts, the people would criticize them and support the Government when it
deals with them sternly. I believe such things will go on happening so long
as the people do not express themselves clearly. Therefore, it is necessary
to face such a situation and I am confident the people will always support
us, they are supporting us. But it needs a lot of fearlessness, discipline and
dedication to the interest of the country.
      The task we are engaged in now is vital and it is
necessary to complete it more speedily. It is therefore that we are
continuously engaged in improving the efficiency of the administration. I
believe, there is no example in the world of the way in which the
administration had been distorted. But why should I find fault with the
Administration. The fault was of those people who were running the
administration. Those at the helm of affairs issued orders and the people
did not have the strength and courage not to do wrong things. They should
have refused wrong order, and resign from the service. It is not very easy
to give up jobs. We have not yet reached the stage when it is possible to
take up another job after giving up the previous one. This makes people
anxious.
       We, however, have to create within ourselves, the force which can
prevent misuse of the administrative machinery. We want to strengthen the
administrative machinery in the manner, that it works fearlessly. In this task
we have also to enlist the cooperation of all. This we are doing. We are
happy that our efforts are producing some results. But we have to make all
efforts in the direction so long as this machinery does not become fully
efficient and the people are not convinced that the administrative
machinery is there for the service of the people and not for passing orders.
I am sure that we will get all cooperation from the people in fulfilling this
task.
      Many disturbances take place in our country. At places Hindus and
Muslims quarrel among themselves. We have also to ensure that this does
not happen at all. We can be proud only if such incidents do not take place
anywhere at all, and everything in the country goes on in an orderly
fashion. This is the only country where secularism has flourished for
centuries. In difficult times of the British, this concept was perverted and we
were forced to adopt wrong practices, which continue to with us even
today. In order to eschew these practices, all of us have to work with
dedication. These are people in the country who create an atmosphere of
violence. I have been meeting the leaders of the opposition regularly to
fight this violence and to find a way out. I am happy that the leaders in the
Opposition too, are giving serious thought to the problem. I am happy that
they are taking the problem seriously. But they too, at times, find
themselves helpless because of compulsions of politics. I can foresee
some difficulties it but we have to carry our work forward. The opposition is
as necessary as the ruling party for the proper running of the democratic
order. That is why we do not want weak opposition. The opposition should
be strong but they must keep in the mind the interest of the nation in view
and work for it. I agree that this is what their hearts also but it takes time to
give up old habits, which are difficult to give up. The measures, I am sure,
will succeed and I am grateful to the opposition for the cooperation it is
extending me.
      You all know that we have a good image in foreign countries and
among our immediate neighbours. The prestige of India has gone up in all
countries but some people in the Opposition say things are to the contrary.
They are not ashamed to say it. I am unable to understand how this
Government, the Janata Government, is selling out country to foreign
hands. Those who were doing this previously are today saying this. I do not
know with what face they do so. The prestige of our country has gone high
in every land and our relations with all countries are on the basis of
equality. I can go any country to ask for help, my visits are meant to
strengthening fraternal relations and I have not asked for any other thing
from any country I have visited. Why should I ask anybody. I have no doubt
the prestige of the country will go up in the time to come and it will become
strong, which is possible only if we are able to stand on their own feet. If
any friendly country comes out to help us we will accept it and should be
grateful for it. But there should be any compulsion for us to ask for
anything. But when we get help, we should be prepared to help other
countries. That is why we are working steadily in cooperation with other
countries and are giving help to other as a part of our duty. This is the
reason why our relation have improved with our immediate neighbours like
Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Burma, Afghanistan and Iran.
      I am happy and grateful to these countries for the cooperation they
are giving. I am convinced that our relations with Pakistan would also
improve. We are also working in improving our relations with China. They
also have shown their willingness for this. We welcome it and are
convinced that our relations with that country also would improve.
      You can also share this conviction and we can move forward with
great confidence. We have to remove whatever uneasiness there may be.
This cannot be done without discipline. I have full faith in discipline and in
the purity of means. This is what Gandhiji taught us. On this point I will not
make any compromise with anybody we will pay whatever price I have to
pay for it. The country can become strong only if it moves forward in a
disciplined manner and puts up pure means. This is exactly what the
Janata Party is doing. Some people say that the Janta Party is becoming
weak. It is wrong because only those say all this who want to see us weak.
I have a doubt about that the party will emerge stronger from all this. I invite
your cooperation, as also blessings, in this task. Jai Hind."
1977,Morarji Desai,Janata Party,A New Revolution,NA,"Prime Ministers of India's Independence Day and Other Speeches (Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru to Dr. Manmohan Sing), Vol 1. Edited by K.V. Singh. Vista International Publishing House, Delhi, India",NA,"Thirty years ago the British left this country on this day India became
Independent. Jawaharlalji unfurled our National flag at this very historic
place and on this same day Gandhiji fasted to bring peace to Calcutta. Ever
since on this historic day for the last 30 years, every year we have been
greeting the nation.
       During these 30 years we saw many ups and downs, passed through
many crises and also shared common joys and sorrows. We made some
progress, specially in industries. We made gentle headway in the field of
education, and we achieved some targets in agriculture as well. But, during
these thirty years, we were attacked thrice. We came out successful and
emerged stronger from these wars retaining our national pride. We made
progress, but the fruits of progress did not reach all specially 60 to 70 per
cent of our population, who could benefit from it only marginally. I do not
like to find fault with anyone. We all are to be blamed. But we should learn
from whatever had happened. If we do not ponder over it and continue to
repeat the same mistakes the very purpose of our freedom, which was to
improve the lot of our countrymen and to invest Indian culture with dignity
so that we could hold our head high in the world, otherwise our dreams
would remain unfulfilled. It was not possible either to full it during the past
thirty years.
       But the greatest drawback we have suffered from is that at we have
drifted from the path shown by Gandhiji a bid to emulate the West. Today
we lack a feeling of pride in our country's strength, and therefore, we have
moved away from that path. The situation the country deteriorated to a
great extent during the past six to seven years. Democracy was in danger.
Our prestige in the world went done. People were of the view that
democracy could not function in this country and that Indians do not have
faith in democracy. It has caused immense harm.
     An atmosphere of terror was prevalent and many excesses were
committed during the past two years. The Emergency that was imposed
was uncalled for. There should not be any doubt about it. But some people
commit mistakes. It is not so blameworthy to commit a mistake as to justify
it and continue to maintain it. The public had to suffer much during
emergency. An atmosphere of terror and despondence prevailed
everywhere.
      A new wind of change appeared as soon as the elections were
announced. Those who were detained were slowly released. The number
of those detained ran into thousands and was certainly over a lakh. The
feeling of helplessness began to disappear and the atmosphere of fear
began to melt away. I can not say that fear has completely disappeared.
Fear does not disappear suddenly. But it has considerably lessened. With
the formation of Janata Party in accordance with the wishes of the people,
a new era was ushered in for the first time. We had been fighting among
ourselves since the fifteenth century which had made us weak. We knew
only to split one into two and two into four, but we did not know how to unite
two into one. That is why we were placed in such a predicament.
      Even after Independence, this state of things continued in the
national parties and also other parties. Each of them continued splitting. A
change came about for the first time when five parties united into one.
What was more important was that all the constituents discarded their
previous ways and accepted the Gandhian way. They decided to take this
course and all of those who had been elected took an oath at Rajgath.
Thus started a new phase. This need was felt by us for some years past.
This unity of purpose adds to the responsibilities of all of us, particularly
those whom the people have given the reins of power with great
enthusiasm and hopes. Their duties to the people are greater than all the
other duties. They have to mould their lives in the service of the country in
such a way as to enable the people to march to progress and to become
fearless, and to raise the country to such heights as to make it the happiest
nation in the world within the occurs of the next 10 years. This task has to
be performed by all of us. There are many difficulties in the way. What has
been done during the last 6-7 years has been responsible for many trouble
and several shortcomings.
      I hope that our people will appreciate that it takes time to start any
new work but how can it be started without correcting the past defects. We
have undertaken this work, we have to work fast and have to remove those
defects within the shortest possible time in order to march forward speedily.
I hope all will cooperate with us in this task, the people will cooperate and
those who have been given the opportunity to administer the country, will
continue to serve the people. Not that, they will simply pass Orders. The
path is beset with difficulties.
     We have to see to it particularly that the backward classes, who are
not small but very large in numbers, do
not remain backward. They should breathe new courage, become fearless
and free from anxieties, and should attain equality with the rest. I would
rather wish that they forge ahead of others. We have to create such a
situation. Atrocities are being perpetrated on our Harijan brothers even
today, of course, those who used to defame, the opposition parties for the
past seven months, are engaged in this business even today. I am,
however, not bothered by it. We will work steadily in the hope that those
who make such derogatory efforts will have to correct themselves and
understand the situation. If the Harijans are attacked, no one will want to
deny it. Such incidents will continue until untouchability is completely wiped
out. We have not worked as much in this direction during the last 30 years
as we should have done. We are all responsible for it. We have to wipe out
this stigma completely during the next five years. We have been subjected
to much suffering because half of our people are poor and destitute. We
have to pay for our sins. It is not a small sin, but a very big sin that has
been committed in this country all along. Even today, we have not come
out of it completely, we have to expiate it and have to atone for the past. If
we do not do so, we will not gain strength necessary to make our country
happy. That is why we have to wipe out the stigma of untouchability
completely during the next five years. Not only that; we have to create an
atmosphere to instil equality in the hearts of all we have to work in a
manner that this feeling of equality is maintained.
      Government officers will have to change their attitude. They should
do so, I don't blame them as much as those we gave them orders. It will be
our endeavour to harness the administrative apparatus completely to the
service of the people. It will then really become the government worthy of
our administration. But the Officers will also have to recognise that they
have a duty. Those, who have gone astray should have remembered that
they are the servants of the people and are paid to serve them. They must
perform this service to the best of their capacity. If all of them
discharge their duties, repression will be a thing of the past. We can then
create an atmosphere in which such things will not be possible again. That
is why we have issued directives to all of them that they should serve the
people in such a manner. If they fail to do so, they will be punished. Let
there be no doubt about it. This is the manner in which we have to march
forward. Our tasks will be accomplished, only if we are able to inspire
confidence in the hearts of our countrymen. That is why we request the
people to be vigilant and fearless. Otherwise, laxity can overtake the
administrators.
       Administrators will never dare go wrong, if the people are awake and
express themselves without any fear. We want to create and maintain an
awareness of this power in the people. Therefore we want to turn our
attention to our villages, which have been neglected in the past. I do not
say that they have been allowed to languish completely, but they have
certainly not received the attention that should have been given to them.
Eighty per cent, of our people live in the villages which are plagued with
unemployment and underemployment. Many people run out to the cities,
where slums come up in increasing numbers. The responsibilities towards
them also go on increasing. No one can live decently in these slums. If I
live there, I will also become like them. There is no doubt about it. So, we
have to improve conditions of these slums. It is more important to avoid
their creation. So we have to develop our villages so that people may not
run upto the
cities. On the other hand we would like the urban dweller to go back to
villages to improve chances of better health and happiness. We have to
accomplish a tremendous job. The job is difficult but it is worth doing. We
can do it only when we strive hard for it. There is no cause for
hopelessness. Hopelessness kills a man. It finishes him. The atmosphere
of fear create helplessness. We have to get out of this atmosphere.
Therefore government has to instil courage in the people, so that they may
become fearless, I think this is the most urgent task before the government.
So long as this is not achieved, we cannot really be effective. I realize we
may not be able to achieve it full. There are so many difficulties.
       Janata Party has come into existence. It is a new party. If certain old
things linger in it, it does not mean that the strength of the Janata Party has
been impaired. The party will emerge stronger. It will continuously derive
sustenance and strength from the people. I am confident that nobody will
be able to break the party. We want people's help in this task. I request you
not to be misled by anyone. If you have any doubt or misgiving, you may
ask me. I will certainly explain things to you. I can assure you that wherever
any corrective action, is needed, I and my colleagues will take that action.
Therefore, you should be vigilant, fearless and stand by the right things.
You have the right to point out to us our mistakes. We will listen to you. We
will also tell you the correct position. Wherever mistakes are detected we
will remove thern. It is our duty to rectify mistakes and we want people's
assistance in this task. My dream that the whole of India should be like a
family is bound to come true. We are marching towards this goal with
confidence. Our country will really become one when we are transformed
into one family. Only then will India be able to cooperate with the whole
world and help it. We have to become competent to serve the world. We
have to serve others rather than be served by them. If we accept, such
service, it is only to enable us serve the world better. Only then, Gandhiji's
dream will come true. Gandhiji wanted Ram-Rajya in this country. Ram
Rajya means that those. Who run the Government should bear the
difficulties themselves but not allow the people to suffer.
      They should set an example to the people of their own lives of
simplicity. We should not forget that we have to serve the people all the
time. We should be people's servants and the people should keep us as
such. We want to create this power in the people. That is why I have been
repeatedly requesting the people to let us know our shortcomings. They
should point out our drawbacks without any hesitation.
       Once I had said that if I am on the wrong path you can pull up my
ears, and also those of my colleagues. We colleagues are all one. We are
not separate. All are combined to make us one. There is nobody, who is
high or low among us. But one should not forget that the people are even
bigger. This is what we have to prepare our people to realise. This is our
main duty, I have no doubt about this; But all these things cannot be
completed till unemployment is removed. We have to provide full
employment in our villages. Nobody should be unemployed or
underemployed. Only then production will increase and the cost of
production will go down which is very essential. If prices fall, the country's
prestige will go up. It is very essential to bring down prices. Some people
have been disappointed that even now this has not been accomplished.
But I would plead with you to remember that such messy conditions were
bequeathed to us that to bring about immediate result was impossible. But
we have taken certain steps and there have been some results. I know
their impact has not yet reached the people. But I am sure that very soon,
such an impact will be created and people will realise this. We have to
increase production which can be done by the people and government
together. We have to go ahead with full confidence, with cooperation and
with affection for each other. This is the lesson that every Indian has to
adopt in his life. Only then we will be able to make the country as great as
Gandhiji wanted it to be. We will then have Ram Raj, which will be free
from strife or sorrow, and where people will help each other. The basis of
our culture is that man should not think about himself alone. He should be
able to have consideration for others and share their joys and sorrows. This
foundation of our culture has weakened. We have to reinforce it with this
quality. I have every hope that people will cooperate in this. Therefore we
must move ahead with hope and faith. We should discard despondency.
We should take this pledge today. I have no doubt about our capacity to
march ahead. Nobody has been able to destroy India. Many civilizations
have disappeared from the surface of this earth. But our country has
survived. Poet Iqbal had said “Kuch bat hai hasti mit ti nahin hamari” (That
there is something which keeps us going). This is the beauty and
characteristic of our culture. We should never lose heart. Let us pledge
today to march forward. Then nobody will be able to stop us and we will be
able to serve the entire world.
Jai Hind!"
1976,Indira Gandhi,INC,"With Discipline, a Better Life","Free rendering of the speech delivered in Hindi from the ramparts of the Red Fort, New Delhi, on August 15, 1976",Selected Speeches of Indira Gandhi: September 1972-March 1977,NA,"Whenever I hoist the National Flag here, I am reminded of the historic
occasion when Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru had first unfurled the flag here. We
are reminded of the suffering and hardships through which we had to pass
and the hopes with which we had put up our flag. When we look back, we
find that we have advanced a good deal along the path we had chosen for
ourselves. We also find that we have committed mistakes. We have had
our shortcomings. And the farther we have come, the longer the road has
seemed to be. At every turn we have found that the difficulties have only
increased instead of decreasing and that if we have been able to meet
some demands, there are many more to take their place. But life is like that
and our effort has been to follow in the footsteps of the great leaders of the
past.
       Freedom is of various kinds. We deliberately chose the goal of Purna
Swaraj (complete independence) as any other freedom would not have
been real. Purna Swaraj does not merely mean the freedom to choose our
representatives, the freedom for newspapers to make as much noise as
they want, although they may be representing the views of a small minority.
What it means is that the fruits of freedom should reach every home,
specially the homes of those who cannot raise their voice and who do not
know what they want. We are trying to take our country towards this kind of
freedom. But, there are all kinds of difficulties on the way. It is also bound
to hurt some section of the people or the other. We want to improve the
standard of living of all people, big or small. But, I am sure you will realise
that if the “haves” get even more, not much will be left for the “have-nots”.
That's why our socio-economic programmes, though meant for all, have
specially the interests of the weaker sections as their objective, whatever
the reason for their condition- caste, economic or the regional situation.
     Thus, at every step, we have to confront some problem or the other.
But we have not faltered in our steps and I am glad to report that the
country has taken a big stride forward during the past year.
      There was one particular programme which called for action both on
the part of the Government and the people. The programme was based on
our feeling that there was a new wave of discipline and awakening in the
country. I don't claim that all our hopes were fulfilled. Still, we have taken
some concrete steps forward and the programme is still underway. It has
made marked progress in those parts of the country where the people were
more responsive. You must be aware that production has increased by
seven percent. Similarly, we have provided houses to seven million families
under our housing programme. Power production too has gone up to 2000
megawatts. The expansion of irrigation facilities too is going on apace.
Land reforms have not been as fast as we wanted. This is not a new
scheme, but new problems crop up every time in land distribution.
      In far off places, they escape our eyes with the result that sometimes
mistakes are committed. That is why I keep on saying, time and again, that
people themselves should bring to our notice cases of injustice. This should
be not merely by way of complaint but also to suggest to us how the
problem is to be tackled. We have received greater co-operation from the
people during the past year. This is not to suggest that nothing had been
done in the previous years. If we had not laid a sound industrial and
agricultural base, we could not have progressed as we did last year. At the
same time, it is also true that nothing could have been achieved without
discipline, howsoever strong the foundation. You would recall that
indiscipline was rampant in schools, colleges, factories and elsewhere. It
not merely affected production leading to greater shortage of the
necessities of life, but all around one only heard slogans of strike and
revolution.
      We too believe in revolution. I believe that Gandhiji was the biggest
revolutionary. But his was the path of non-violence, of peace, of friendship
and if we had strayed from that path, we would not have been able to
achieve Independence and lay the foundation of our democracy. We tried
to step up industrialisation and add to the country's strength in every
possible way. Howsoever people may try to denigrate our country, there is
no one who can deny that India was never as strong as she is today.
Without strength, we cannot improve the condition of the masses. We
imagined that once we had won the struggle for freedom, our
Independence would be secure. But, we had to contend with foreign
aggressions. More dangerous than these are, however, the secret
campaigns which are not visible on the surface. We could hear whispers
here and there even earlier. But last year, they turned into an open
challenge. These countries which did not help India preferred to support
dictatorial regimes, which liquidated hundreds, even thousands of people.
Not one of these countries talked about these killings. But, they had the
temerity to criticise us.
       You may perhaps, recall that this is not the first time it has happened.
When Gandhiji was alive, he was also roundly criticised. So was Nehru.
And before these sections had turned their attention to me, they had
switched over to India as the target of their attacks. Why should India
conduct an atomic explosion, they asked, as if this was going to pose a big
danger to the world. On the other hand, many of these countries were
spending billions on their nuclear arsenal without any excuse of an external
danger. They can keep on arming themselves, but we don't have the right
to do anything even for our economic development. When we started
setting up our steel plants, we were asked why should we need them when
our villages were still so poor. You know that steel is the basis of industrial
development. It is needed by farmers, factories and the people. If
Jawaharlal Nehru had not planned for steel production, we would have
been begging abroad for it. Today, we don't have to beg for anything,
although we still need a lot of things.
       Only a few years back, the prophets of doom said that India would
never be able to feed its millions. Today, we have had a harvest of 120
million tons of foodgrains and we don't know where to store them. It is true
that Nature had been kind. But we would not have reached this level of
production without the help offered by the Government to which the farmers
readily responded. Some areas, specially in the south, have suffered from
drought and in a few other places, rainfall has been too heavy. I
sympathise with the farmers who have suffered as a result. I know they will
be able to face the situation courageously with the help of scientific
advancement. We have to see that our Plan schemes reach the remotest
corners. We would also like to have special programmes for the various
regions, which should take into account their specific needs. We will be
able to march forward briskly only when we are imbued with the desire to
make the fullest use of our resources and not by demanding the setting up
of steel plants or big industrial factories.
      We have seen this year that some of our public sector undertakings
have registered a profit, although the big industrialists were never tired of
saying that the Government was not capable of running factories. Whatever
increase in production we have had is because of these factories and I am
confident that those which have been lagging behind will also catch up. So,
we have to be vigilant all the time to maintain the improvement. I would like
to congratulate our workers who have contributed to it.
       I will be leaving in a short while for Sri Lanka where, you know, there
is big conference of the non-aligned nations. The problems there too is how
to safeguard freedom- freedom to think, act and work for each country's
future. This is the main problem. If we cooperate and assist each other, we
can create a new strength. Poet Tagore has said that if the weak act boldly
and firmly, they can generate their own power. This has been our
experience also. What was our strength during the freedom movement?
We were poor and oppressed. And yet, when we came together and stuck
together, we created a force which was even mightier than any army.
       This is the strength we have to inculcate among the poor. The
problem is that there are some countries which are misled by others. They
are keen to seek assistance if they can get it. They don't care if this is going
to affect their freedom, for it cannot bring the strength. We have also
accepted assistance from other countries, irrespective of their ideologies.
But we were firm on one point. We were prepared to accept it only on the
condition that our freedom of action for our country's betterment will not be
eroded. But we are not prepared to seek aid on any terms. We have stuck
to this policy right from the beginning. Today, we are criticised, because of
some restrictions on newspapers and some arrests. The real reason is that
our critics cannot tolerate the idea of a poor country like ours marching
ahead without the assistance of others. My reply to them is only this: the
more they condemn us, the greater will be our resolve to stick to our own
path of progress.
       You have seen in the past how we have stood up to foreign
aggressions. The history of this country has been full of such struggles. We
have always stood for peace and tolerance, but we should remember that
ours is also a history of courage, bravery and idealism. You are all the
representatives of a resurgent India, the symbols of a new awakening. This
is important for all, young or old. Criticism or praise is a small matter in
one's life. There is only one question before us: How can we take our
country forward? This should be our aim, whether others like it or not. If the
younger generation is not imbued with the ideal of service to the nation, it
will prove to be our greatest weakness.
      We have to guard our frontiers and take pride in our armed forces.
But they can fight bravely if the nation is behind them. Let us take a look
today at our past and future and then decide the direction in which we have
to move towards progress. This is our own responsibility which we have to
discharge with the strength of our hands and the intellect of our minds.
And, if we have this resolve, no one can push us back. I am confident that
we will be able to add more to the discipline we have acquired.
      There is some speculation these days about the lifting of the
emergency that had been declared. No one bothers to notice that it has
already been relaxed for several months. What's the result of this
relaxation? Has any one of those released admitted that violence, strikes or
stoppage of work is bad for the country? Is it not that they are still bent on
the same path? What happens in future is not in our hands. It depends on
the attitude of those who are engaged in fomenting unrest and indiscipline
and in acts of violence and sabotage. They are encouraging forces which
have no faith in democracy and secularism or in the kind of freedom that
we stand for.
       We are again on the march and we have to see that the schemes
launched to remove poverty after so many years keep up the tempo that
has been acquired. Maybe, the pace is not as fast as we would like it to be.
Seven million houses in a big country like ours is not a substantial figure.
But it is still some achievement, looking at the fact that there was none
earlier.
      We want people to take part in schemes for their betterment of their
own volition, with a will to serve the country. Gandhiji always stressed that
there was no right which did not flow out of a responsibility. Only on the
basis of such rights can we achieve true democracy in which the poorest of
the poor will also be able to make himself heard in which no section will be
able to dominate others because of its social or economic privileges and
where the people will try to safeguard not merely their own rights but also
those of their under-privileged brothers and sisters. If we care only for the
rights of a few, we will only be relapsing into a situation which has proved
harmful in the past.
      Today, in this country, we need courage and vision to fashion a new
India. This will need united efforts on the part of all to lift our country to a
position of glory. We have to improve the living conditions of the masses
and to see that the future of our children is better and bright. My prayer is
that we all should march shoulder to shoulder on this great journey.
     Before I close, let me congratulate you all once again on this
auspicious occasion and wish you a happy future.
      Jai Hind! Jai Hind! Jai Hind!"
1975,Indira Gandhi,INC,Eradication of Poverty,"Free rendering of an address in Hindi from the Red Fort, Delhi, August 15, 1975",Selected Speeches of Indira Gandhi: September 1972-March 1977,NA,"This year there is one thing new; not only the people assembled here
are able to see me but people in 2,400 villages spread over in six States in
the country are able to participate along with us in today's historic function.
They also are able to witness this historic occasion and hear whatever is
happening. Something new has happened not only in the history of India
but, perhaps, also in the history of the entire world when rural programmes
have been started through the satellite at a time when TV has not covered
fully even the cities. For this achievement we are grateful to our young and
bright scientists, whose work and labour have enabled India to take a big
stride towards progress. Similarly, during this year our scientists performed
another great feat when they put a satellite in space. You all have heard
about the satellite, Aryabhata. All this is symbolic of the nation's progress.
       We have unfurled the flag here today and we do so every year
because it represents our urge cherished since pre-Independence days, to
unfurl free India's flag on the ramparts of the Red Fort. An opposition leader
once remarked : what is this flag, but a mere piece of cloth! Surely, this is a
piece of cloth but one for which thousands of freedom fighters had
sacrificed their lives. For this same piece of cloth our brave soldiers painted
the Himalayan snow. with their blood. This piece of cloth is symbolic of the
unity and strength of India. It is because of this that we revere this piece of
cloth and always keep it aloft. We are never to let it dip low and every
Indian, high or low, man or woman, young or old or child, has to remember
this always. This is a piece of cloth all right, but it is dearer to us than our
lives.
      Like the calumny about the national flag, misunderstanding was also
created recently about our Independence. Freedom is not a magic which
can independently eradicate poverty and remove our difficulties.
Independence only opens a door, which removes the stagnation of
centuries. That is all that Independence means. It does not mean the
licence to do whatever we may want to do. Rather it offers us an
opportunity to do our duty.
      Independence does not merely mean a Government by Indians. It
means that the Government should be capable of taking independent
decisions courageously. It must also mean that such a Government should
be capable of thinking independently in the interest of the country as well
as in the interest of world peace. All this together would mean
Independence.
       We became free not to destroy whatever we had or violate our
cherished ideals, but because we had to lift the people, who had remained
oppressed for centuries and also because we had to fight and vanquish the
evils that had crept in due to feudalism, casteism and superstitions, and
which were responsible for our backwardness. We must do away with them
and uplift the country to progress. It was for this that our great leaders
guided us and opened the door of Independence.
       Since we became free, much has happened in the country and we
have made a lot of progress. I have referred to the Aryabhata and also to
the other communication satellite, but apart from that we have made great
progress in every direction, including agriculture, industry, education and
health. It is true that the benefits of this progress have not reached the
poor, nor could that happen immediately. We have first to lay strong
foundations for the country and all these years we have been busy laying
those foundations. All of you know the difficulties that we encountered and
all of you, who are assembled here and the millions who are listening to my
voice as well as those who are able to see me in the distant States, have
gone through difficult times and faced difficulties courageously. And,
because you had courage, hope and faith, you were able to surmount
those difficulties.
      The path we chose ourselves was the path of democracy. But, what
does democracy mean? Like freedom, democracy too does not mean that
everybody is free to follow his individual path. People can opt for
themselves policies, they can follow a different line of thinking, they can
raise their voice of protest, but all this has to be done within a certain set of
rules. They cannot adopt a course that would cause pain to others or
weaken the country or allow alien influences to condition our policies and
tamper with our course. I have just now said that we take our decisions
independently. For some years, and particularly at the present juncture,
false propaganda and rumours are being indulged in, but I wish to reiterate
that our policies are not the policies of one or the other power bloc.
       We do not belong to this or that bloc, nor do we belong to any third
bloc. We go ahead keeping in view only the interest of India. I want to make
it clear that we have never allowed any other country to interfere in our
affairs. We are not letting it happen now and we will not let it happen ever.
This does not mean that we do not want friendship with other countries. We
want friendship with all, particularly with our neighbours, with whom it is
necessary to have friendship and co-operation. Our endeavour is to
develop friendship and co-operation even with those countries who are not
our neighbours, because in the world of today we have to move together
and help each other. Because we are not moving together and because
quite often we let tensions arise, the world is not able to progress the way it
ought to, and science and new discoveries are not able to benefit millions
and millions of people who must benefit from them. Amid all tensions,
disputes and misunderstandings, our policy has always been to remove
misunderstandings, and wherever there are disputes, try to settle them
through discussions and conciliation, rather than war.
      Within the country also we have followed the same policy.
Unfortunately, some people thought that they had to adopt a different
course. This different course did not represent any particular policy
because people subscribing to different points of view had joined hands
together. These people did not see eye to eye with each other either
regarding the country's foreign policy, or its policy at home, and yet they
joined together. It cannot be claimed, therefore, that the agitation was
started on the basis of some policy.
      We saw that very many evils which existed earlier spread further.
They increased instead of decreasing. Why did that happen? Why did
indiscipline spread? The students were exhorted to stay away from schools
and colleges, the workers were asked to stop work in the factories. Thus,
whether one was in administration or in any other profession indiscipline
infiltrated everywhere. Everyone thought of taking advantage of the
opportunity and serving his own selfish interests. Everyone forgot about the
country and did not keep in mind the direction we had to follow, the
programmes we had to implement, the long journey we had to make the
difficulties confronting us, and the dangers we faced.
       Despite the progress that we had otherwise made, the last year, as
you all know, was a year of economic difficulties. There was inflation,
increased unemployment and scarcity of essential commodities. This
situation prevailed not only in our country, but in the entire world. We did
not lose heart and we boldly faced the situation. We took strong measures
against black-marketing, hoarding, smuggling and corruption, and these
measures started to have their impact on rising prices.
       But these measures did not make our opponents happy. On the
contrary, it somehow infuriated them further. They decided, therefore, to
launch all over the country the Gujarat and Bihar type movements, aimed
particularly against the Central Government. The opposition consisted of
many parties, including the factions, who did not believe either in
democracy or in non-violence. You can very well visualise what would have
happened to the country had such an agitation been allowed to be
launched. Would it not have added to the misery of the people? Would it
not have weakened the country? Such would have been the consequences
at any time, more so, at a time when in a changing world we are faced with
all kinds of dangers and the people are greatly concerned with their survival
and progress. You can very well imagine the impact of launching of such
an agitation at such a time would have had on our children and on
everybody else.
      We, therefore, had to take certain stringent measures after careful
thought. We took these measures with a heavy heart but we were helpless.
In a way, it created an unusual situation, but in a sense these measures
were taken to arrest the unusual situation that had continued for some
years. You have seen the impact these measures have had. The prices
started falling, and we witnessed a new wave of discipline. The students
who were not prepared to sit for their examinations took them voluntarily.
The people in every walk of life also applied themselves to their tasks.
      Some prices did increase recently but this price increase is a
common phenomenon during the monsoon. There have been natural
calamities also. In Bihar, U.P., Punjab, Assam and at some other places
there were serious floods. I have deep sympathies with the flood-affected
people, and we are making all efforts to provide relief to them as soon as
possible.
       But, with all this we can claim that the rate of price rise, which had not
been controlled even last year, has been totally arrested this year. The rate
of increase in unemployment also had been halted last year but
unemployment exists and it can be removed only when we accept
discipline and increase production. It will be removed when all students or
teachers, traders or consumers, writers or artists or those belonging to
thousands of other professions--would stop thinking only of themselves.
Only when they become an instrument of change in their profession and
community, the country will truly be able to progress fast.
      It is our earnest endeavour to look after those members of the
opposition who do not happen to be outside. I have written to the Chief
Ministers to instruct their officers to ensure that no injustice or excess is
done. All law-abiding citizens must always be helped. Whether it is the
police or other officials, they must act as friends of the people. If any
person sincerely realises that he has committed a genuine mistake, he
should be helped to be reformed.
      The present occasion is similar to the one when with great hopes free
India's flag was first unfurled, as you might recall, not here but at the India
Gate in New Delhi. We had felt that a new opportunity had come our way.
Soon after we were engaged in solving a number of problems; evils like
indolence, corruption, inefficiency creeped in. Since we were busy tackling
more important issues, these evils got a chance to grow. Today, we have
an opportunity to eradicate them, set right our national policies and work
unitedly as one man to build a new India. Every nation is faced with some
problems. Whatever the problems, India has always tried to solve them
during peace and war, with patience and courage.
       I see a large number of our brave soldiers, of Army, Air Force, Navy
and police in front of me. People at times tend to refer to the police in
inimical terms. But they too are sons, brothers and fathers, as they also are
from among the people. If sometimes they err, they should be directed to
the right path and create an atmosphere of friendship and cooperation.
      We have always been proud of our brave soldiers, and we always will
be proud of them. They brave the seasons and guard our frontiers with
determination. They know that it has never been our policy to attack any
country; our policy has always been that of friendship. We have always to
be vigilant but we will not launch an offensive, except against aggression.
      Today, a new opportunity has presented itself to us to move forward,
particularly on the economic front. With the co-operation and help of the
people, the pace of progress can be accelerated. I have been receiving
offers of co-operation from groups of people, including students, and I am
glad that they are now concentrating upon their studies. Many of them are
simultaneously devoting themselves to social service. The workers are
engaged in increasing production. The farmers, as always, are engaged in
hard work. I am glad that the rains have been good this year and their
labour will certainly yield a good harvest.
       All of us have a duty to perform. We have the duty to work for the
advancement of our community and bring about in it a new awareness. We
also have to consider what each one of us can do, not only in of his or her
own field, but also in respect of tasks concerning the community. Take, for
example, the question of cleanliness of your house, its vicinity and the
roads. It is not the duty of the Government or a Municipality or of certain
officials alone to ensure cleanliness. It is the duty of the entire public, of
each and every citizen. Similarly, there other things to take care of. There
should be no wastage; we may buy only what is absolutely necessary; we
should not hoard. If the prices go up, housewives should try to find out why
it was happening and whether they could check it. Whenever there has
been a collective efforts, they have always succeeded. We have also to
save our forests by planting more trees. The people have also to ensure
the success of the family planning programme. There are many other
activities, which may be called governmental activities that affect each one
of us, as also the future of the country. All of us should work together to
make these programmes a success. We have to show a new way to our
children.
      We were not happy to declare emergency, but we had to under the
compulsion of circumstances. But, every dark cloud has a silver lining.
Stringent measures were taken just as bitter pills have to be administered
to a patient in the interest of his health. We should use the opportunity to
cleanse the political, economic and other aspects of the national life, and
bring some charm and freshness to it. We have learnt a lot from science,
but we have to learn much more. We are no better or worse than other
countries. Every country has its good points and bad points and so have
we.
      But, India has also its tradition of honouring sacrifice and service. Its
special characteristic has been to develop spiritual strength. While we may
learn many things from other countries and not close our minds to new
ideas, we cannot ignore the roots we have in our culture. Our culture
stands for a synthesis of the spiritual and scientific values to evolve a new
man. This is the demand of times and the need of the society.
       Many years ago, Jawaharlal Nehru had said: ""Freedom is in peril,
defend it with all your might."" I would reiterate Freedom is not endangered
by our not allowing some people to speak out. It is not a good thing to
impose this restriction and it has to go. I have emphasised this on two
earlier occasions. But freedom is imperilled when we forget to understand
the true meaning of freedom and of democracy and when we don't realise
where the interests of the nation lie. If we have to save our freedom we
have to bring about once again the unity, determination and courage which
will enable all to work unitedly and increase production.
       It is the endeavour of the Government to remove obstructions that
hamper progress. At the same time, we have to consider how these
hurdles were created. The obstacles came because some people were
bent on exploiting the situation to their advantage. Had those people not
taken undue advantage, there would have been no need to curb their
activities. All of us have to ponder over these problems. Real freedom will
come when we remove poverty from the country. Real democracy will
come when socialism and secularism are fully established. Some people,
who in the recent past kept raising slogans of democracy, did not believe in
socialism and were in fact indulging in communalism.
       Now is the time for us to think afresh over all these problems. We
have also to understand the functioning of the Government. Some people
accuse me of concentrating all power in my hands. But the orders that I
may give have to pass down to Ministers and then on to big and small
officers at various levels and finally to the patwaris in the villages. In the
process, the orders are sometimes implemented and sometimes not. At
times, some people inadvertently modify these orders. At other times, they
get altered deliberately. Some people exploit the orders to their advantage,
while some others are always busy preventing their implementation. All
these things happen, and this is the one main reason why we could not
implement some of our major policies.
       I meet not thousands but millions of people. There would hardly be
any person in the world, who would meet such a large number of people
coming to me almost every day from all corners of the country. I receive
many reports every day, but the country is so vast that it is not possible to
get all the information. Some information comes late and some does not
come at all. Therefore, all of you, wherever you might be, have to bear in
mind that it is our duty to defend democracy, I have to see that the
programme of eradication of poverty moves vigorously ahead, despite
attempts by powerful elements to obstruct it. I have to ensure that the
streets, the villages and the cities remain clean and beautiful. I have also
announced the 20-Point Economic Programme. There are many big and
small tasks to complete. Until and unless everyone of us does not accept
his or her responsibility with regard to these tasks, the danger of mutilation
of these programmes will always remain.
       There is a new thinking today and the people should ponder over it
deeply. They should not be swayed by slogan-mongering. They should not
vacillate and be misled. Instead, they should move resolutely and keep
their objective in view. When that is done, as I have emphasised many a
time, no one would be able to stop India from marching ahead. No one,
within or without, who is opposed to India becoming strong, can prevent it
from marching ahead. We have, therefore, assembled here today to take
the pledge to work hard, to make sacrifices and to serve the nation, in order
to achieve real freedom and democracy. This pledge has to be taken by all,
both young and old, in order to build the nation that may draw from our
tradition and also benefit from the modern knowledge.
        We are gradually developing our resources, but our greatest assets
are our courage, morale and self-confidence. Only when these remain
unwavering, will we be able to build India of our dreams. Only then will we
be able to serve the poor, provide adequate employment to the people of
all religions and classes, and keep our pledges to provide them with their
requirements. I ask you all to have confidence in yourself and in the future
of the country. Ours is not an easy path; it is full of difficulties, bristling with
thorns. It is not a path of rest and respite, but of hard work. But, if you move
on this path you will be able to find a new world, you will achieve a new
contentment, because you will realise that you are building a new India and
creating history."
1974,Indira Gandhi,INC,Towards the Bright Future,"Free rendering of an address in Hindi from the Red Fort, Delhi, August 15, 1974",Selected Speeches of Indira Gandhi: September 1972-March 1977,NA,"In our long history, the people of India have passed through many
vicissitudes and undergone many sufferings, but today the economic
problems influence us all. Thus, while I am happy on our Independence
Day anniversary, my heart is also full of sorrow and anxiety. I am aware of
the difficulties you are facing. Floods and droughts have further added to
the sufferings of the people already burdened with economic difficulties. My
sympathies go out to you all.
       The most important question today is that of rising prices and scarcity
of essential commodities. You are also aware of the circumstances which
have brought about this situation. But, this should not lead us to believe
that nothing has been achieved during all these years. In one sense, it is
the progress that we have made and the crises and challenges that we
have faced, which have contributed to our economic difficulties. At a time
like this, we should not be debating as to how and why these difficulties
have arisen. Instead, we should be thinking of the ways to surmount these
problems unitedly. In the past also, the Indian people tackled many a crisis
on a war footing and overcame them successfully.
       Drought and war have led to shortages of many commodities. There
has been good progress in our agricultural production, and you are aware
that it has even doubled or tripled. However, in the last four years the rate
of growth has not been the same as it was in the previous years. This year,
particularly, shortage of fertilisers and quality seeds further added to the
difficulties. Even so, the shortages are not unbearable. We may have to
modify our habits, change traditional ways and may also have to suffer a
bit. Once we accept this, it would not be beyond us to put up with the
situation. The most dangerous thing would be to give up hope and to feel
that nothing has been done or can be done.
      At a time like this, everyone has some responsibility or the other. Of
course, the first responsibility lies with the Government and we are not
overlooking this factor. You must have observed that for some time past,
we have taken stringent steps to reduce Government expenditure. Many
programmes, although beneficial to the people, but not considered
essential, have been abandoned. Many things are in short supply and the
Government is devoting its attention to reducing their consumption in order
to conserve them for essential purposes. It was never our intention to
freeze or reduce wages or dearness allowance. All that we want is that a
part of it may be set aside and not be spent. The money, so deposited, will
also fetch attractive interest. When there is greater spending, the money
supply increases and if production is not proportionately increased it leads
to serious consequences.
      You are all aware of the unavoidable and essential expenditure the
Government had to incur on giving relief to the drought-stricken people and
on war. On the other hand, there were some other unavoidable items of
expenditure which led to further inflation. We are at present engaged in
containing inflation, and to some extent we have succeeded. If you would
understand the issues involved and extend us your co-operation, we would
be able to succeed in greater measure and save the situation.
       Our farmers have been giving considerable help. There is often a
discussion whether priority should be given to the agriculture or industry.
Now, there is no question of differentiating between the two. We have to
see that both prosper simultaneously. Our farmers feed the country, and it
is only through their toil that this country has survived through the
centuries. Therefore, it is natural that they should be given all help so that
production increases and the standard of living of villagers goes up. It is
their duty to utilise every inch of land for agriculture and it is the duty of us
all not to do anything to spoil the fertility of the land.
      The demand for chemical fertilisers has gone up, and now there is a
shortage of fertilisers. The shortage is not only because production has
lessened but because the demand has gone up. Today, even the small
farmer wants to use chemical fertilisers, and we are indeed happy that he is
prepared to adopt modern technology. But, at the same time, we have to
see whether we can utilise alternative sources. Now, even some of the
affluent countries of the world are taking to old methods. This is all due to
shortages. It is also because they have realised that satisfactory results
can be obtained only through a combination of the old and the new. When
the use of chemical fertilisers came into vogue, the farmer saw that
production increased through its use and he started using it in increasing
quantities. He gave up the use of manures, which he used earlier, for
instance, cowdung, green manure and waste. Now, to overcome shortages
and also to see that the fertility of the land remains at a high level, it is
necessary to use both types of fertilisers side by side.
       Similar is the case with shortage of other resources, like power. The
Government is trying to increase generation of power through every
means. There is shortage of oil and we have undertaken oil exploration.
But, still we have to discover alternative sources of energy, which can be
harnessed. Here, again, if we look at the West, we find that many of the old
methods are once again coming into vogue. This may not be a permanent
phenomenon, but it is essential now because we have to tide over the
difficult situation. We have also to see how we can harness solar energy
and wind power. Today, the discovery should not be confined only to the
scientist. Every individual, whether in the village or in the city, has to see
what new methods he can discover and put to use for the benefit of society.
On the one hand, the farmer has to see that agricultural production goes
up; on the other, our industries also have to be developed. If there are no
industries, many of our essential commodities cannot be made available
and even the farmer will not get his basic necessities. Whatever the farmer
needs- quality seeds, tractors or other implements- they are all
manufactured in big factories, the establishment of which has cost us
crores of rupees. The rich farmers, who have benefited mainly from the
new technology, should help to raise the standard of living of the villagers.
Greater the awareness in the villages, more the agricultural production and
greater the availability of things of comfort and entertainment.
      Today, when we increase taxes, who bears the burden?
Unfortunately, the big people avoid taxes through some means or the
other. Many of their names do not even figure in the income-tax list. All
businessmen are not bad, but through the misdeeds of some of them, the
entire community gets a bad name. Those who do not pay taxes or sell
adulterated food or medicines or those who hoard and earn black-money
are responsible for the misery of our country. This is a blot on India's name.
Some people exploit the people's difficulties for their selfish ends without
any thought for the future. It is not only a question of the future of others. It
is also a question of the future of their own children. So, when so many big
people and some of the people of middle classes like contractors, doctors,
lawyers and the self-employed do not pay taxes, what happens? The entire
burden of taxes falls on those people who are in the fixed income group.
       Sometimes, we are accused of imposing a land but are overlooking
the city-dwellers. There are so many rich people in the cities. Are we
overlooking them? Some measures have been taken. Taxes have been
raised and we are trying to see in what ways we can limit wealth. Unless
the people share each other's burden, the country will never be able to
improve.
       Just as the country is dependent on the performance of the farmers, it
is also dependent on the production capacity and discipline of the labour
and the management of the industries. Only through hard work can we
increase the production and only by overcoming the mutual differences can
we help our farmers and the entire country. Today, all classes are facing
difficulties. In fact, the whole world has always faced one difficulty or the
other. We all have to get together and overcome these. I am aware of the
fact that in times of great hardships, it is the poor who have to bear greater
burden because the rich have greater capacity for absorption and
sustenance. Similar is the case with the affluent nations. India may be a
poor country and thus the burden may have told upon her, but we also
know that Indians have not given up hope in any adverse circumstances.
On the contrary, the people have emerged strengthened through all
difficulties.
       Today, we have to see as to how we can rid the society of its evils. Is
it through violence or agitations? Can we remove the evils through fighting
against one another? The problems are complex, and we have to get
together and see how we can solve them. Of course, it is the responsibility
of the Government, but can't every individual citizen do his bit? Can't our
brothers and sisters refrain from buying things, which are not available in
the open market, but are available only in the black-market? Can't our other
brothers and sisters grow vegetables in pots and cans if they have no land
attached to their houses, keep their city clean, and help in eradicating evil
practices prevalent in their neighbourhood? Every single citizen,
notwithstanding the class he belongs to and his resources, can put in his
mite which will not only be in his own interest but in the interest of the
nation.
      Unfortunately, we are prone to lapsing into complacency when
something good comes about. But when there is some difficulty, we all give
up hope. Sometimes, it seems that the entire nation has adopted a
defeatist attitude. No problem has been solved by giving up hope. I have
enumerated some of the problems. There are other problems too. For
instance, our population is rising at a tremendous rate and the people of all
classes are demanding more of everything. Today, a cycle, a motorcycle, a
tractor or a transister is a common sight in the villages, although nobody
could even dream of it only some years back. All this is, of course, good. If
we are to raise the living standards of our people, we have to control our
increasing population.
      We are redoubling our efforts to strengthen our country. We will never
relapse into idleness. Recently, we exploded a nuclear device, through
which we gained more self-confidence. Some countries criticised us. There
were also some misunderstandings and some people utilised this
opportunity to denigrade us. But, we have made it clear that whatever
energy we have, nuclear or non-nuclear, we will utilise it for the benefit of
the people and will co-operate for its development.
      In the international field, there have been many incidents and many
new forces have come to the fore. India has always tried to maintain
friendship with all and, as you are aware, friendship has indeed increased.
You must have seen how we entered into agreements with our
neighbouring countries. This we did to lessen tension, and I think we have
set an example for the whole world. But all of our neighbours have, in spite
of our efforts, not learnt anything from our experience. Some of our
neighbouring countries are trying to threaten us even today. We hope that
peace will not be disturbed, and all the poor developing countries will be
able to devote themselves to the task of social and economic progress, and
their attention will not be diverted. But, life is such that no matter how much
our internal difficulties, we cannot afford to neglect the external dangers.
We have to remain ever vigilant.
       Our country has become stronger in the past few years. In our long
history, there have been difficulties, and you are aware of the problems we
have had to face- of the wars we had to fight and the millions of refugees
we had to care for. In spite of this, we kept on with our development
activities and we will keep on doing so. I only have to tell you not to be
disheartened, and have courage and faith in the country's future and in
India's people.
      Sometimes, there is discontent and unrest among the youth. This is
natural. But, how is this energy to be utilised? Should we dissipate our
energies or utilise them for some progressive purpose? The youth require a
strong India more than we, and the country also needs energetic young
men. Today, we have to dedicate ourselves to the task of tearing asunder
the dark curtain and to see the bright future of the country. No country has
been able to mould its future without passing through difficulties and
dangers. If we are to mould our history, we have to progress rapidly and
wean away from all such factors like poverty, disunity, social evils and
despair, which weaken a nation.
       There are many children in front of me and whenever I see them, my
mind is diverted to the other children living in the villages and the cities.
What kind of future are we to mould for them? Our age is a link between
our glorious past and our bright future. A great responsibility devolves on
us. Let us get together to shoulder these responsibilities and to turn into
reality the hopes that we nurture for our children. Due to our policies of
peace and friendship, of strengthening India and of bringing about unity
and socialism in our country, India has gained respect abroad. It is the
responsibility of all of us to see that this prestige increases. India is strong,
but not as much as it should be.
       India will become strong only when this mist of despair is lifted and
when every individual picks up courage. You can give the answer as much
as I, whether we can achieve this or not. The future of India depends on
each citizen as much as it depends upon me or the Government. I am
aware that when there are dark clouds, people forget what sunshine is and
what light is, but this does not mean that there is no sunshine or that light
has disappeared. Sunshine is there and one, who has the eyes to see and
also the strength of soul and mind, can progress himself and help his
country to progress in that direction.
       This is the lesson we have before us today, because we know that
our struggle for freedom was not won easily. We had to make sacrifices,
and only after passing through the days of darkness and despair did we
come to the 15th of August, when our tricolour was unfurled for the first
time. That tricolour is not a mere piece of cloth. Why do we respect our
flag? In fact, every country respects its flag. Its brave soldiers are ready to
lay down their lives for it. Why? Because it is the symbol of the country's
strength, its hopes and its greatness. This is the reason that this piece of
cloth commands so much respect. But, the real respect cannot be made
manifest merely through words or merely by unfurling the flag. The real
respect lies in creating an atmosphere for our flag to remain high. We keep
it high during war, but we have to see that in our national, political, social
and economic life we do not do anything whereby the respect of our flag
diminishes in any way in the eyes of other countries and even our own. We
all have to think over this and decide for ourselves as to how we can keep
our flag flying high, and how we can strengthen our dear country. We shall
have to decide the steps we will have to take for creating a bright future for
our children and for the youth.
      August 15 is a day of sacrifice. At the same time, it is also a day on
which we can peep into our future. Unless people of all classes, religions
and languages are united, we cannot achieve anything. Communalism and
casteism can only weaken us. In some respects, their influence has
weakened, but in other respects it has increased. Now, if we have been
able to lessen these influences why cannot we eliminate them totally? Why
cannot we give justice to those who have remained oppressed and to
whom justice has been denied all along?
      When I started my speech I had said that my heart is full with sorrow
and anxiety, but I want to tell you that this sorrow has in no way
overwhelmed me to the extent that I cannot visualise the future. There is
sorrow, there are anxieties and burdens. But, along with these, I can also
see a bright future, not a distant one but a near future. I can also see how
we have to move step by step, so that we can reach our goal. I have faith
that all of you will be able to march forward with the same confidence and
strength so that by the next 15th of August we are able to eradicate most of
the evils of today and overcome most of today's difficulties and take the
country from darkness to light. To all of you who are here in front of me in
Delhi and to those listening to me on the radio in all the corners of the
country, I once again extend my greetings and my good wishes for the
future. I will once again tell you that we are all soldiers of India, whether in
uniform or in civies. Like soldiers, we have to stand straight and march
forward with courage and determination."
1973,Indira Gandhi,INC,Spirit of Determination,"Free rendering of speech in Hindi, Red Fort, Delhi, August 15, 1973",Selected Speeches of Indira Gandhi: September 1972-March 1977,NA,"Once again we gather at this historic place to celebrate the
anniversary of our Independence to pledge ourselves to defend our
National Flag and to serve our beloved people. Our Independence day falls
during the monsoon when the sun and shade intermingle, which is
symbolic of the intermingling of joy and sorrow in the life of a nation as
much as in the life of an individual. Ours is a country of farmers. We
welcome the rains because the farmers and the entire country depend on
this. Our irrigation and power resources and many other programmes
depend on the rains. But today, we are under clouds of different kind, the
clouds of difficulties and sufferings.
      Our country is suffering from some shortages. The prices have risen
and and have risen tremendously. We do not wish to conceal this fact, but
we should also try to understand as to how these shortages came about.
You are aware of the drought, which has affected us during the last to
particularly in Maharashtra, Gujarat and Rajasthan, but in Mysore and
some other States too the drought has been on an unprecedented scale,
which has not been witnessed during the last 50 years. But our people did
not lose heart.
       I have toured those areas and can vouchsafe for the courage and
fortitude with which they have faced the drought. The foreigners who went
there to see the conditions were surprised to see the people's courage and
determination to face this challenge- whether they dug the land or broke
stones or were busy in constructing dams. They sang as they worked. No
one complained. If they asked for something it was only the means to
rehabilitate themselves. We have to spread this spirit of determination
through the entire country.
      The areas producing millet, maize and groundnut were particularly
affected by the drought. Thus, the shortages began, the prices increased,
the chain reaction of shortages was set in motion, the demand increased
and the prices rose still further. There were reasons for the price-rise in
some cases but in many cases there was no justification for the price-rise.
The drought had not affected only our country, but large parts of Asia and
Africa as well suffered drought and had to import grains on a large scale.
Thus, the prices of foodgrains rose in other countries and affected the
prices in our country, too. The prices have risen not only in these countries
but even in the affluent and advanced countries of the world.
      The same story of shortages, sufferings and complaints would be
revealed if we go through their newspapers or talk to the peoples of those
countries. This does not mean that the causes for price-rise in these
countries are the same as in India. In fact, they are totally different. But
national boundaries cannot check the economic winds. These affect the
prices in our country, as these countries have to import the required goods
which lead to higher prices in these countries and which in turn affect the
prices of goods in our country. Thus, we should see our problems in this
wider perspective.
      Some people accuse the Government of extravagance. They ask as
to where all this money is going? Where has this money gone? Massive
amounts have been spent in providing relief to one crore people affected by
the drought and you are aware of the huge amounts which we had to
spend earlier to look after the refugees from Bangladesh. Then came the
war. All this could have been compensated by a good harvest, but it was
the other way round and a terrible drought not only wiped out the harvest
but even the wells and rivers went dry and inflation increased.
      The Government is making all efforts to cut down expenditure. We
have effected a reduction of Rs. 400 crores in the expenditure
contemplated earlier under various programmes for each Ministry and the
State Governments and every department of the Government has been
asked to cut its expenditure on non-essential programmes or to temporarily
shelve them. Some of the essential public services may be affected by this
reduction but we cannot help it.
       These are hard times, and as in a family, so in a nation we have to fix
priorities. India is a large family and we have to mobilise our resources and
use them judiciously. In this context, the main responsibility is that of the
Government but in this the public is equally involved to ensure that they too
reduce their expenditure to the minimum.
      We all feel annoyed when we hear of black-marketing and shortages,
which the people are facing. But the same goods are sold at higher prices
in the same shop behind the counter. I have absolutely no doubt that those
who hoard or who sell goods in the black market should be dealt with
severely and awarded stringent punishment. These people, however, do
not belong to a different category. Things are sold in the black market
because there are people to purchase them. If the people are not prepared
to buy at black market price, the traders would not be able to sell them.
       We have seen that for whatever reasons, some people have
obstructed the procurement of foodgrains. If there is a fire, the only
question is how to put it out and nobody questions how and where from the
water is to be obtained. Whatever be our food policy, whether it is liked or
not, is it not the duty of everybody to see that what is procured and
distributed to all equitably or who need it, so that nobody starves? This is
the responsibility of the entire community. We are accused that we have
taken over the wholesale trade in wheat. Some people think that this has
led to shortage, but no one can prove that grain would have reached the
shops if we had not taken this step.
     According to the information received from various sources, it has
been proved that had we not taken over the wholesale trade in wheat it
would not have reached the people and would have gone into the black
market depriving the weaker section of the society. Only those who could
have afforded a higher price would have got it. The middle class and the
urban people have faced difficulty, but we have been able to give grains
anyhow to those who needed them most. I do not, therefore, accept there
was anything wrong in this policy.
     Another question is that why do we not pay more to the farmer? If we
now pay higher price for the wheat it will further affect the price of other
commodities. The farmer, no doubt, would have got more but it would have
caused more hardship to the other section of the population. We all have to
swim together. Thus, some people may benefit but the rest will suffer.
        During the struggle in Bangladesh, when the people were rejoicing, I
had warned that the country would have to pay a heavy price for it in terms
of economic and social tensions. And so it happened, and the Government
is fully prepared to meet this challenge. I assure you on this occasion that
the Government is determined to solve the problem of shortages, rising
prices and take strong action against anti-social elements. Some steps are
being taken. Programmes have been chalked out and others will be
initiated. But no one can do miracles alone, no Government can solve all
problems by itself.
      We have democracy in our country under which people have got
many rights and have to bear many responsibilities. Unless everybody
shares responsibility in this matter, the situation cannot improve. As I said,
if some people sell at a higher price and others are prepared to pay that
price, then this malady cannot be checked. The people have to be alert.
      It is necessary that the Government reduces its expenditure but it is
also incumbent on the people to cut down their expenses. I do know that
there are people in our country who are too poor to reduce their
expenditure as they are not getting enough even today. There is a vast
number who can hardly make both ends meet. In our present-day society
the standard of living has gone up. Certain consumer items not heard of
earlier have become daily necessities. Who should decide to make due
with the minimum?
       Fortunately, there has been good rain this year, but it would take
some months for the new crop to reach the market and we have to make
arrangements till that time. We seek the people's cooperation to manage
with the stocks in hand and with what is being imported to stall any serious
situation. All the housewives and others should scrupulously avoid waste.
This would enable us to tide over the difficult months ahead.
      The people should not take the law into their own hands to deal with
the hoarders and profiteers but inform the concerned authorities. We have
to create an atmosphere against hoarding. Some people think that it is only
through agitations and bandhs that their grievances could be heard. But
here does this lead to ? The work stops, there is disorder and violence and
the very items we need become scarce. The prices go up. If there is loot
there will not be proper distribution; prices will further go up and there will
be strikes. You must have seen in Delhi and other places how people have
to face difficulties.
      It is the farmer who feeds the people and who forms the backbone of
our economy. It is his bounden duty to increase production and make it
available to the Government so that equitable distribution is ensured. First,
we have to increase production, procure foodgrains and then distribute it
among the people. In this we all have to co-operate.
      Action has been taken to step up arrangements for increasing
production of power, agricultural products and the situation is steadily
improving. Along with the demand for personal freedom, we have also to
ensure that there is no violence and the people maintain law and order. If
there is a clash, it is the common man who has to bear the brunt.
       Employees also form an important section of the society. Our
progress, specially industrial growth, depends upon them. They too have
demands. I realise that strike is an instrument to achieve these demands.
But, there are times in the life of a nation when individual demands and
individual needs have to be set aside, in the larger interest of the country
and the society. We hope that no factory will be closed. Mill-owners and
industrialists, whatever their difficulties, will bear them anyhow and see that
the mills and factories continue to function. In the same manner, I would
request the employees to solve their problems through mutual discussions
and negotiations. But under no circumstances should there be a let-up in
production. This is the time to take such a decision and act with a sense of
responsibility.
      Similarly, the common man has also to understand and realise his
responsibilities and obligations. Certain things we can tell and other people
can also think and tell us. Our democracy does not mean that you only cast
your vote. The people of the country voted for us in the elections and we
have tried to take such steps which would enable even the smallest man to
have confidence and raise the prestige of India. This has happened. But
even after this can we say we have all carried out our responsibilities?
      Our ancient scriptures teach us to maintain equanimity during trials
and tribulations, amidst stresses and strains, and not to lose our
perspective in joy or sorrow. But, what actually happens is that any happy
development sends us into ecstasy, while a small difficulty is enough to
plunge us into despair. The question is whether we want to be a nation of
those who cry, complain or quit in the face of difficulty or a country of the
courageous, who squarely and boldly face their trials and privations. This
question has to be answered today in our country by the young and the
aged alike.
      In this gathering today, there are many freedom fighters of yore, old
in years no doubt but young at heart. Their zest for life and enthusiasm is
as intense as of any man in his thirties, forties and fifties. Today, we seek
the co-operation of these young veterans to guide us, to imbue us with their
courage and determination.
       Rains or no rains, the country must forge ahead. The programmes
have to be completed. In war or peace, we do not wish to slacken the pace
of our progress. Some people counsel a 'Plan Holiday'. This is dangerous,
for, this implies mortgaging India’s future to present comforts, ignoring
completely the country's poor. There cannot and there will not be any 'Plan
Holiday'.
      When I last spoke to you here, I had mentioned the changes coming
about in the international scene. These changes continue and new
friendships are giving a new complexion to this scene. This continent is still
to reach the kind of peace and adjustments it should have reached. People
blame us. I will not repeat here the story of the prisoners-of-war of which
you are all well aware. The Government of Bangladesh and our own have
made some proposals, generous proposals, which have been hailed
throughout the world. Negotiations are continuing and will be resumed in a
few days. But, should these negotiations fall through, the people of India,
the people of Pakistan and the whole world will know that the Governments
of India or Bangladesh cannot be blamed for this. They will know who is
responsible for the prisoners not going back to their country and who is
creating obstruction.
       We have together faced many a hurdle. Sometimes we came out
flying colours, sometimes success eluded us. Now we face our acid test as
a nation and if we are able to tackle it resolutely and courageously, we will
have a future ahead of us burnished and bright like gold tried by fire. And,
so will be our people.
      I will repeat my question today : What kind of a future are we aiming
at? We want a people whose hopes will never be shattered. We want a
people whose voice, the voice of peace and friendship, is echoed in all
corners of the world. Our great leaders held up to us the ideals- of a new
world, of a new vision- and we have to fulfil their promises. But that is not
enough.
      A new generation has come up. I hope this new generation will be the
harbinger of a new light. They will be disciplined and brave and will show
the veterans present here that they are second to none. They will build a
New India."
1972,Indira Gandhi,INC,Fight Against Poverty,"Free translation of speech in Hindi from the ramparts of Red Fort, Delhi, August 15, 1972","The years of endeavour: selected speeches of Indira Gandhi, August 1969-August 1972",NA,"Twenty-five years ago our National Flag was unfurled for the first time
here at this spot. The entire nation awoke into a new life that day. Last
night we paid our homage to those thousands of people whose services
and sacrifices led us to freedom. Different types of people took part in our
freedom struggle. Many among them were great revolutionaries but most of
them joined the non-violent non-co-operation movement. It was the
sacrifices of all of them which roused freedom consciousness in the country
and forced the British to quit India. There were several others like men of
the Garhwal Regiment, the Naval Ratings of Bombay and the I.N.A. who
made many sacrifices for the cause of our freedom. There were so many of
them that it is rather difficult to name them all. Most of them are no more
with us now and we pay our homage to them. We also express our
gratitude to others whom we are fortunate to have in our midst today. It is
their selfless service and great sacrifices that brought us freedom.
      Twenty-five years ago when we unfurled our flag here it was not the
end of our fight but a beginning of a new fight— a fight against poverty and
a fight to make freedom a reality for our teeming millions. All of us are
partners in this great struggle and have to go a long way to achieve our
objectives. We have to ensure a better life for our children and find more
jobs for our young men. During the last 25 years we have covered a long
journey, a journey not of comforts alone but of many hardships, difficulties
and dangers. But, as you know, we are today stronger than ever before; we
are more resolute and united and our democratic institutions have taken
deeper roots.
      However, we have to see that the pace of our progress is accelerated
and we fulfil our pledges. As you know we have made some progress and
have a number of achievements to our credit. But I regret to say that there
are some people in our country who even question these achievements.
They even questioned the desirability of our celebrating the Silver Jubilee
of our Independence. This is a strange attitude and very difficult to
understand. Can't they see the progress we have made so far? Perhaps
they can't or perhaps they don't like it.
      There is a mighty upsurge in India today and we all should try to gear
ourselves to meet the challenges before us. We should strive for unity and
strength to achieve our objectives. Any temporary difficulty or our failure to
do things should not lead us to believe that there has been no progress.
We do make mistakes sometimes but these cannot nullify our
achievements. While we criticise ourselves for our shortcomings, we should
not overlook our many achievements. We have to do some heart-searching
and decide what the shape of things should be.
        Almost every year, as you know, we face droughts in some parts of
the country and floods in others. These bring misery and sufferings in their
trail. But the impact of such tragedies today is not the same as it used to be
years before. Previously, whenever there was drought in rural areas there
was hardly any assistance from outside. But things are quite different now.
We take immediate steps to rush aid to the affected areas and face the
calamity unitedly. We cannot stop these calamities. We cannot prevent the
vagaries of nature but we can always face them unitedly. A significant
development we see is the increasing self-reliance among our people and
a belief that they alone are the masters of their destiny. This is our greatest
asset and a source of our real strength.
       As you know we have made considerable progress in the fields of
agriculture and industry. Twenty-five years ago when we became free our
condition was really bad and we were full of anxiety. We were faced with so
many problems and it looked as if we would not be able to solve them.
Many people thought that India would not be able to preserve her
independence. But these people were proved wrong. We were successful
in solving our problems one by one. During these years we have made
significant progress. Food production in the country has increased, a large
number of new factories have come up. All the critical and complex
problems were solved one by one. Production of steel and electricity has
increased. Many heavy machines, which we were formerly importing, are
now being manufactured in the country. The development of heavy industry
has enabled us to manufacture other machines indigenously. It is true that
our production has not kept pace with the increasing demand. The more we
produce the more we need to meet our demand which is largely due to
rapid increase in our population. So we are always faced with the problem
of how to meet the demand which is increasing day by day. Some people
do not see things in proper perspective and try to belittle the achievements.
Such persons who close their eyes to the realities are no friends of the
people.
       I would like to take this opportunity to thank our Armed Forces for
their heroic and courageous deeds. These brave soldiers and officers of
our Army, Navy and Air Force have made great sacrifices to safeguard
freedom of the country which has been attacked five times. I firmly believe
that the freedom of India will always be safe in their hands. We express our
gratitude and sympathies to the families of our brave soldiers and officers
who lost their lives in the fighting. All of us including our army and police
have to make a united effort to uplift the country. We fully realise that the
real strength of a nation depends on its progress, on its ideology, on the
unity of its people, on the readiness of its people to make sacrifices. We
see lot of tension in the world today. The real question before us is whether
we want to fritter away our energies in useless agitations and quarrels or
whether we want to look into our future and act to make it really
prosperous.
      Today we find restlessness among our youth and others. This
restlessness is not peculiar to us alone. This is a universal phenomenon
today. Maybe, in India it is because of unemployment, maybe, it is because
of poverty, but why we see this restlessness among youth in other
countries where there is no unemployment or poverty. To my mind this
restlessness is because we are emerging from one age and entering into
another. And when such great transformation takes place it is bound to
result in some restlessness, sorrow and suffering. We cannot remain stuck
to the old order nor can we wish that there should be no change. We want
to play our part in this change. These changes are of various kinds. In India
we have poverty and it is necessary that we implement our development
programmes speedily to eradicate poverty and create conditions conducive
to these changes. We have done a lot of things in this direction but we
have still to do much more. To meet the unemployment problem we have to
enforce programmes to remove it as soon as possible. It is not possible for
me to go into details at the moment but these programmes have been
explained in the Parliament and placed before the people at other forums.
Some of these have already been undertaken and others are still to be
taken up. These programmes have been designed to meet both the
immediate and future conditions. There are many problems which we must
solve. We cannot wait passively for their solutions. We ourselves have to
shape our future. We want that every Indian should have a hand in shaping
our destiny. It is true that we are now free but, as I said earlier yet to make
this freedom real for our teeming millions. We have to build a society in
which each individual can enjoy full freedom- economic, social and political.
In fact, we have to build this kind of world society. We cannot isolate
ourselves from the world today. We do not covet anyone's territory. We do
not want to interfere in others’ affairs. We want others also to follow the
correct way like us. I think we have in the last few months shown the world
something. You all know how we last year met the aggression against us.
Our forces fought heroically and achieved a real victory. In fact it was a
victory of an ideology, a way of thinking and the world could see it. This
victory has given strength to India and has created unity and enthusiasm
among our people.
       We have never made an attack on anybody, nor have we tried to
pressurise anyone. In fact, there are some who have tried to pressurise us.
But, as you know, we have resisted all such pressures. We carefully
choose our own way and do not get swayed by the currents. As you know
there is not any readymade way. We ourselves have to make it, step by
step, and it is possible we may sometimes make mistakes or grow
complacent but it has to be of our own making. A nation's character like an
individual's is built the hard way. The real strength of a man is his character
and only a man who works hard is a man of character and not the one who
leads a life of ease and extravagance. We do not want a nation which only
loves ease and comforts. We want a people who love working hard for their
livelihood, a people who struggle to create better opportunities of life not
only for themselves but for others also. I think our freedom will be complete
only when we are able to create such conditions for our people.
        I strongly feel that our independence would not be complete so long
as we do not completely eliminate casteism from our society. We all must
think as equals, citizens of India, an ancient country, which gave to the
world a unique culture and high ideals. We have to show the world that we
still value those high ideals whatever be our religion. There are many
religions in India. If we follow our religion sincerely there can be no quarrels
among us. No true religion teaches us to suppress those belonging to other
religions. Toleration of others' views has been our tradition. We must
maintain and strengthen this glorious tradition so that the entire mankind
benefits from it.
      I mentioned about our old revolutionaries and freedom fighters who
are still in our midst today. We want inspiration from them. We want their
blessings in shaping the future of this great country. To the young
generation of India, I give my good wishes. It is they who are to build the
India of our dreams. They are the custodians of the honour and security of
India. Let us pledge ourselves to build a clean, progressive and a great
Bharat.
         The way this country will move forward is not yet known and I cannot
tell it. But I know that an inner force, a new life is struggling to be born. With
its birth, humanity will find a new way, a way to peace and co-operation
among mankind which will make the world one family.
      We have to remove not only economic poverty but the penury of our
thinking. We have to bring about a new way of thinking. Our young men
sometimes go astray and make mistakes but they have the strength to
deliver the goods. It is time we make the best use of all the strength and
knowledge that we possess to take the country forward so that it is able to
help the rest of the world in moving along the correct path.
      Recently, as you know, we have tried to come to an agreement with
our neighbouring country. People ask me if I trust that country or not. My
answer to them is that I trust only one country and that is India. We have to
trust our people, our unity and our strength. We want that there should
always be friendship and peace in this sub-continent so that we can march
forward speedily."
1971,Indira Gandhi,INC,Need for Unity,"Free translation of speech in Hindi from the ramparts of Red Fort, Delhi, August 1971","The years of endeavour: selected speeches of Indira Gandhi, August 1969-August 1972",NA,"The month of August has a great significance in the life of our nation.
Every year we meet here not merely to see each other but to salute our flag
which is a symbol of our independence. It is also a symbol of our heroes
who laid down their lives for independence and of those who are willing to
sacrifice their lives even today.
      Many of you who have assembled here and millions of others in their
homes, fields and factories today want to know how far the country has
moved towards its goal and how far from it it still remains. Truly speaking,
the journey of a country never ends. However fast and long we may move,
the distance always remains to be covered.
      Many significant things have happened in our country during the last
year. First of all, I must thank you for proving wrong what many of us here
and abroad were saying about India and its people. In the biggest election
ever held anywhere you have shown that the people of this country are fully
aware of their rights and their duties. Despite many a difficulty, you did not
desist from exercising your vote even at places where there was risk to life.
You did not vote for a person or even for a party but you voted for the
progressive programmes and policies which had been put by us before
you.
       Since then, as you know, we have been trying to do things and have
taken some preliminary steps towards achieving those objectives which we
had placed before you. Poverty is a terrible condition which brings
frustration to the people and weakens the country. Therefore, our first task
is to remove poverty. We have to remove social and economic disparities
to achieve our objectives. As you are aware, we have taken some
significant steps in that direction and are striving to remove obstacles in our
way.
       In the last session of Parliament we passed a Bill for amending the
Constitution. This disturbed some people. There was some misleading
propaganda to the effect that the land and other properties of the people
would be taken away. Some members of the minority communities felt that
their rights might be affected. I have said it before and I wish to reiterate my
assurance here today once again that we will not take away anything from
anyone. We only wish that the benefits of affluence which some of us enjoy
should also accrue to those who have nothing so that the strength of the
nation grows. There is already a ceiling on land which varies from State to
State. We hope this problem will be reviewed and appropriate action taken
to give relief to our landless farmers and other weaker sections of the rural
community so that they too can play a useful role in the life of the
community. They have to be partners in our efforts to improve life in our
villages. There is also a proposal to put a ceiling on urban property. We
are, therefore, determined to implement our programmes one after the
other. Some of these programmes have already been implemented, while
others are still to be implemented.
       After the General Election, when your representatives assembled
here in Delhi, you had, like us, very high hopes. We thought that we would
be able to make progress rapidly. However, suddenly and for no fault of
ours, we were burdened with a problem which we had never imagined. But
you know that the people of India have been able to carry many burdens
and will continue to do so in future as well. We know that the inner strength
that our citizens have, whether they are soldiers or civilians, old or young,
will enable us to surmount all the difficulties that may come in our way.
      I do know that quite a few things have happened that have disturbed
you. At the same time many things have happened that have strengthened
our hopes. The brave manner in which our people faced many difficulties,
carrying various burdens and coming to each other's help, is a matter of
pride for all of us. We, as citizens of India, have to see that we defend not
only our own rights but also the rights of those who are unable to raise their
voice. This, obviously, is not a Government responsibility but a
responsibility of every citizen. As you know, we still suffer from the age-old
disparities and inequalities. These disparities give us a bad name and
weaken the country.
      The removal of economic disparities is, of course, the responsibility of
the State but it is the people who have to remove social inequalities. The
great responsibility of uniting India and strengthening it lies with the people.
       Another problem which we, and particularly my sisters, face today is
of rising prices. The price spiral affects all of us and it should be our
endeavour that the prices of essential commodities remain at reasonable
level. Why do prices rise? Sometimes, when a commodity is in short
supply, there is a rise in its price and one can understand it. But many
times when a particular item is taxed, other items which are in no way
related to it also register rise in prices. Who raises these prices and why?
Obviously, they are the unscrupulous dealers. You have to be alert and
organise yourself to see that this does not happen in your locality. You
must realise your responsibility as citizens whether it be about price rise or
any other matter.
       As you all know, India has faced many challenges. But the challenge
that confronts us today is such as has never been faced by any country in
the world. All these years while we had been striving to give our people
their rights, things had been going on just the other way across our
borders. Elections were held there just as elections were held in our
country. As in India people there too came out in large numbers to vote but
whereas we have been trying to fulfil our promises, a great tragedy has
happened there. As a result of the atrocities inflicted on them over 7.5
million people, many of them wounded, sick and starved, had to leave their
homes and take shelter in India. We have always kept our doors open for
refugees. But they are not merely refugees; they are partners in a
movement which is very significant. It is a movement similar to the one we
had in our own country, and also in many other countries to secure the
rights of the people. We cannot overlook the heavy price these people from
Bangladesh are paying for the freedom of their country.
       We have thus to keep the wider issues in view and surmount all the
difficulties that may come in our way. We cannot overlook the bigger issues
just because there are some difficulties. We have to face these difficulties
and do our utmost to overcome them. We must also be aware of the factors
on account of which we in this country have adhered to the principles of
democracy and to our constitution and have been trying to give concrete
shape to them for the good of our people at a time when nations around us
have bid goodbye to democracy and constitutions. We must continue to
maintain our traditional values. We have to safeguard our freedom and
democracy and make them really meaningful for our people.
       As you know, it has always been our policy to carry our people with
us. Our foreign policy has always been of seeking peace and friendship.
We hate war and do not indulge in sabre-rattling. We do not raise slogans
which can hurt others. It is because we know that the real strength lies not
in words but in our strengthening the country both economically and
politically. This is how we look at things. We do not threaten anyone nor are
we scared by anyone's threats. We are confident that India can and will
face any emergency with courage and determination.
      You are aware that there have been floods in some parts of the
country and severe drought in some others so that even drinking water is
not available at some places. Despite all this, enough food has been
produced in the country. There is some shortage of pulses and oilseeds.
On the whole, there is no shortage of foodgrains. But we have to feed not
only our own people. Just now, we are also feeding a large number of
people from another land.
       Every lover of freedom and of humanity is bound to raise his voice
against events in Bangladesh, India has to see whether the steps that she
takes or the slogans that are raised here strengthen the people of that
country. I assure you that India and her people will always support the
cause of freedom everywhere. The people of Bangladesh have our full
support. This is time for us not to feel disheartened, however great the
crisis. There never was any reason for feeling disappointed. We have
proved that we have faith and self-confidence and that we can stand up to
any crisis, and make whatever sacrifices are necessary. There is no reason
for us to doubt that we have a bright future.
      As we see today, a wave of change is sweeping this country and also
other countries. No one can remain unaffected by this new wave of change.
This wave will engulf all of us. However, we do not have to fear it because
we are swimming with the current. In fact, we are giving a direction to this
current and we know that we are ready to face whatever the future may
bring us.
       On this auspicious day our fullest sympathies are with those who
have to undergo suffering either because of floods or drought or poverty or
any other kind of injustice. I say to them: Be courageous and lend us your
hand. We will do everything to help them and take our beloved India
forward. For all of us this is the time to be ready to face whatever
difficulties, sufferings and dangers there may be.
      The people of India may be poor or illiterate. But this has been a land
of heroes and such has been its history. There is no reason for us to fear or
to withdraw from the path we have chosen. Only one thing we have to keep
in mind—that we adhere firmly to our traditional policy of secularism.
       Recently, we entered into a treaty with the Soviet Union. Some
people think that as a result of this treaty there has been a change in our
policy. I can assure you that there has been no change in our policy
because it is the right policy. It is not as though we cannot ever change our
policy. But the policy we have so far followed is the one most suited to
conditions that have so far existed and is based on principles that we value
most. Today we see that many countries, whether they admit it or not, are
inclined towards this policy. In fact, for countries like India no other policy
can be of any good. Therefore, we have to stick to the basic values
whether they flow out of our traditions or from our present-day politics.
      In our day-to-day work we do make mistakes. However, we should be
bold enough to accept them and always ready to correct them. We have
made many changes in our policies and would continue to do so whenever
necessary so that we are able to put our poor people on their feet and
make India strong. World history tells us that a country does not progress
through the barrel of a gun. A country makes progress only when its people
are served well, when they are strong and when the Government is run
with their consent.
      Whatever our party or political ideology, we should be united for the
defence, unity and territorial integrity of our country. Today we should have
only one slogan and that should be : Let us be one, let us be courageous
and let us march forward.
       Whether in uniform or without it, all of you should regard yourselves
as soldiers of the land and be determined to lay down your lives, if
necessary, in the cause of the country. We are all soldiers today and shall
fight for freedom and the advancement of humanity."
1970,Indira Gandhi,INC,A New Awakening,"Free translation of speech in Hindi from the ramparts of Red Fort, Delhi, August 15, 1970","The years of endeavour: selected speeches of Indira Gandhi, August 1969-August 1972",NA,"Independent India today enters the twenty-fourth year of her freedom.
Every year, on the banks of the Yamuna, at this Red Fort, the people and
those who serve them meet one another, and derive strength from one
another. The country has witnessed many changes in the past one year.
There has been a rethinking by the various political parties and the people
on various issues. All of them have been trying to clarify their policies and
looking for new paths. The people had an opportunity to strengthen
democracy and to take stock of their progress.
      The past year had been a year of great revival of activity. Earlier,
many programmes had been left unexecuted either because of war,
drought, economic recession or other reasons. We are again marching
forward but certain forces are perturbed by the speed of the progress we
are making and are opposing the steps we are taking. However, I know that
the people are aware of what is going on, of what is right and what is wrong
and what is good and what is bad. The people have the capacity to
discriminate between good and evil. Herein lies the value of democracy.
Real power vests in the people.
      Ever since I was elected to this office I have been touring the four
corners of our country. And never before, as in the last year, have I found
our people so alert, so awakened, and so aware of their rights. Never
before have I seen them so hopeful and so ready to welcome the new
changes. This is both a good sign and a great challenge to us. We have to
face this challenge.
      As I said earlier, many programmes which could not be implemented
are being carried out now. Production in both agriculture and industry has
increased and is continuing to increase. Nationalisation of banks has
thrown open new avenues to the people, particularly to the youth of the
country. Though it is more than a year since nationalisation of banks took
place, the fruits of nationalisation have started accruing to the people only
during the last few months. As you know, the implementation could be
started only after the matter was cleared by the Supreme Court.
      These days we hear strange slogans being raised. Some people talk
of violence. But I want to tell them that violence has so far not solved any
problem. However noble our objectives may be, if we adopt wrong means
we cannot achieve these objectives satisfactorily. I had thought that the
debate between violence and non-violence had already been settled in our
country. During our independence struggle we had disproved the belief of
those who felt that we could not achieve independence through
non-violence. We proved to the world that it was possible to free our
country by means of non-violence.
      I want to assure you that even economic progress and all big
changes can be brought about in our country through non-violence. It is our
duty to rise above ‘slogan-mongering' and unitedly find out ways and
means of doing some solid work. Some of our young men think that they
have discovered a new way of revolution. I can understand the
disappointment and restlessness which is felt by them. I do believe that
restlessness is not always a bad sign. But I appeal to them to first see in
which way the interests of their country can be best served, whether these
interests can be served by raising slogans and by indulging in destruction
and sabotage.
       We are today facing some big and difficult problems. Price increase is
one. This is, in fact, a big problem. When prices rise, the common people
feel the pinch, particularly those belonging to the fixed income groups, as
also the workers. We are very much exercised over it. However, you have
also to appreciate the fact that when a nation goes forward prices move up
to a certain extent. Doubtless, it is our duty to ensure that the prices of
essential commodities are stabilised and there is a balance between
incomes and prices. At the same time, we know that when prices of
foodgrains go down, our peasants and those living in rural areas are
adversely affected. This adds to their burden. We have therefore to weigh
every issue very carefully and then find a middle path. Thus, if there is any
distress it will be evenly distributed and no one individual will suffer more
than another. We are seriously exercised over the problem of the “haves”
and “have-nots”, between those who have everything in excess, whether
urban property or anything else, and others who have very much less. As
already announced, we are going to take some action in this matter.
       With our march forward, we will have also to be careful that there is
no setback to our production. Any slowing down in our pace of progress will
considerably affect our ability to help the poor and the down-trodden. I
know that many people feel that the country is not going ahead with
sufficient speed. I am, however, confident that the path we have chosen is
bound to accelerate our progress and, by taking new steps, we would be
able to forge ahead.
      This is not the time for minor changes here and there. We have to
bring about great changes. Gandhiji and Pandit Nehru have shown us how
big changes can be brought about through the strength of the people.
       When I was thirteen years old, my father gave me some advice in the
letter he wrote from jail. He told me not to do anything secretly and not to
do any work which it might be necessary to hide from others. By adopting
this principle in our struggle for freedom, Gandhiji could give it a non-violent
character and it became a source of strength for the weakest among us. All
parties, organisations and the people should work in the open so that the
people are able to understand them and help and co-operate with them.
This is the essence of democracy.
      It must be admitted that our economic condition has improved
considerably. Along with progress our problems have multiplied, for
progress creates problems and sometimes problems show the way to
progress. Our problems are like a mountain which we climb. We cannot
afford to look back and see how far we have climbed. We have only to think
of how much more remains to be climbed. For that purpose we have to rally
together.
       This is the approach we have to adopt in the matter of price
stabilisation and in creating employment opportunities for our youth. Where
price increase is inevitable we have to put up with it. Many employment
avenues have been suggested, some within the Plan and some outside the
Plan. I hope our young men will take advantage of these and explore new
ways so that they can stand on their own feet and be self-reliant. The youth
in advanced countries have shown how self-reliant they can be.
      We have started implementing youth employment schemes. Some
young men are receiving assistance from the banks. Some get assistance
from other sources. All these schemes will serve as effective instruments
for providing employment to the unemployed young. It must be realised that
everybody cannot at once get job suited to him. We are on a journey which
is long and arduous and we can reach our destination only step by step.
Already many steps have been taken on this journey with courage and
enthusiasm. When our young men join us in this march they would be able
to take us all forward more speedily.
       Undoubtedly there is need for economic and social transformation. At
the same time there are certain difficulties which come in the way of such
transformation. Recently, there was a new problem. A new slogan had
been coined : “Land Grab”. I do not want to say anything at length about
this on this occasion. I will confine myself to only saying that some people
have too much land whereas some have no land at all. This is not just. We
have taken a few steps in this direction which have given relief to some
people. It is our duty to see that the Acts which were passed with this end
in view are immediately enforced. Whether this is done by the Central or
the State Governments, implementation must be done honestly and
effectively. The Central Government are doing their best to persuade the
State Governments to implement these reforms speedily and thereby
discharge their responsibility. Necessary legislation which has not yet been
passed will soon be passed. But, however strongly we may feel about it, it
would not be just possible to give land to everybody. The problem before
us now is how to distribute the fallow land that is good. We are
concentrating our attention on this and I hope that this will be done more
expeditiously.
       We still face yet another problem, which is frequently and widely
discussed. That is the problem of communalism. One of the many great
qualities possessed by our country, not from the modern period but from
time immemorial, is that it has treated all religions on the basis of perfect
equality. We have equally respected the different philosophies and creeds
of all the religions. This has not meant the individual departing from his own
religion. But we have always given shelter in our country to others,
irrespective of their faith.
      I have often asked myself as to what is really Indian. Our ancient
saints and sages have told us that Truth is one but there are several paths
to reach it. We have always accepted this fundamental truth. If we forget it
we will weaken ourselves, and if we remember it we will go from strength to
strength.
      This is an age when the people of one country learn from the
experience of other countries. This is not a sign of weakness but the sign of
a new age. We can learn a great deal in the field of science and technology
and use this knowledge for the removal of poverty of our people. Change is
the law of life and the changes taking place in the world today are of
entirely different kinds. Basic changes are coming about. That is the reason
why there is so much turmoil, turmoil not peculiar to our country alone but
which is sweeping the whole world.
       The cardinal principle of our foreign policy is world peace. If there is a
dispute between two parties, they should settle it by mutual discussion
without taking recourse to force. This we have been repeating for years
together. Recently, two developments have given us great happiness. One
is that President Nasser of the United Arab Republic has accepted the U.S.
peace proposals for West Asia. Perhaps a complicated problem will be
solved by this. President Nasser has displayed courage in accepting these
proposals. Similarly, Soviet Russia and West Germany have met together
and signed a non-aggression pact. The point which India has been
repeatedly stressing in pursuit of its foreign policy has, it seems, been
accepted by them. I hope that the result of these two recent developments
will prove beneficial to world peace.
      Unfortunately, in another area, war is still continuing. There, it is not
only continuing but it has further enlarged. Many people who have nothing
to do with it— innocent children, old men and women have also been
engulfed by it and they are undergoing tremendous suffering. Our heart
goes out to them in sympathy.
       In the United Kingdom, a step which the new government has taken
after coming into power has caused us some anxiety. This is their intention
to give some arms aid to South Africa. We know that this aid would give
encouragement to the South African Government's policy of colour bar and
apartheid. It would also prove dangerous to the independent countries
adjoining South Africa. We have raised our voice against this and we hope
that the United Kingdom would reconsider her policy.
      I come here every year and meet the people. It seems to me that the
assembly gathered here today is larger than in previous years. This may be
due to several factors including hopes roused in the hearts of the people,
as also the realisation that the struggle is a long and difficult one in which
they should participate. It is not enough that we enjoy the facilities and
comforts which are available in an independent country. We should equally
share the miseries, sufferings and burdens that are there. If we look at our
problems from this point of view, then we would be able to solve them.
      There are many people in our midst who do not have strength
enough to bear any more burdens nor can they march in step with us.
Every year we remember them on this occasion. So long as we are not in a
position to render more help to these people we will not be able to
accomplish anything, however laudable our programmes for their
betterment may be.
        I realise that the Harijans, the tribals, those living in the mountains
and forests and those on whom the burden of poverty is the heaviest have
been the least cared for after Independence. There are many reasons for
this state of affairs. In some cases, even if there is a programme for their
uplift, the benefits cannot reach them owing to lack of communications. We
shall do our best to help these people, however great the difficulties.
     We are determined to solve our problems, however complicated they
might be. Ours is a great country, but sometimes we are lost in trivial
matters. I am a member of a political party. Most of us are members of this
or that party. Even if you take all these parties together, they are very small
compared to the totality of the people of India. We have always to keep the
general good of our country, its problems, its development and its progress,
before us and not that of any party and have to relegate small matters and
small objectives to the background. Ours is a great country and, therefore,
we have always to adopt a high and noble outlook. Gandhiji tried to place
this picture of our country before us. Young as we then were, we could not
understand this and were sometimes angry with him. We felt that perhaps
we knew more than he did, just as our young men feel today. But now we
have started realising the true significance of Gandhiji, and it may be
several decades before people will realise what a great man was amidst
us. As we realise the extent of his greatness, we should try to shape our
thoughts and actions accordingly so as to better serve our country. This is
the objective we should keep before us. To provide material comforts to the
people is the duty of both government and society. But there is a higher
objective to be achieved. We want to provide facilities to the people to
increase their strength so that all might join in uplifting the country and
making it really great.
      I had referred earlier to our foreign policy. With the interests of our
country uppermost in our minds, our policy has been to maintain friendship
with our neighbouring countries and to arrive at agreements with them, by
sorting out differences and seeking new ways of co-operation. At the same
time we realise that the stronger our society and the greater our unity, the
more strongly would we be able to stand up to other nations. You know that
our brave defence forces, whether they belong to the Army, the Navy or the
Air Force, and whether stationed in the mountains, the plains, the deserts
or on the sea coast, are ever prepared to face every danger. Part of their
strength lies in the strength of their arms. The other part lies in the strength
and the support of a strong and united people standing behind them. The
defence forces will be relieved of much anxiety with the knowledge of
strong support assured from a united people. Today, on my behalf as well
as on your behalf I offer my good wishes to the Armed Forces, whether
they are stationed here or are far away from us.
       I also offer my good wishes to our peasants and workers, students
and intellectuals, traders and government employees and to the women of
India, whether they live in cities or in villages. As a servant of this country, I
renew my pledge that, with your co-operation I will continue to struggle to
eradicate the poverty in our midst. Gradually, our people are getting
nation-and-civic conscious. As they come to realise their duty towards the
building of a glorious future for India, they would be prepared to make any
sacrifice. Our people are brave and have shown great courage, particularly
in times of difficulty. Sometimes, however, when we have felt there was no
danger, we have tended to relax and become complacent. But, the present
age is a perilous age, not only for our country but for the whole world.
Whoever is weak may come to grief. Therefore, it is our duty to remain
united and overcome our shortcomings and failings.
     We have to take determined steps to move forward. All of us should
ask ourselves a question every day. Have you done anything for the
country? Have you done it honestly and industriously? If you are able to get
honest answers to these questions, you will soon find that we are able to
accelerate the pace of progress of this country.
      Thousands of years ago, Gautama Buddha said: “I am not concerned
with what others are not doing. My only concern is with what I do or do not
do”. Every citizen should have this ideal before him. Everybody should see
that he pursues correct path, that he serves the country and society, and if
he does that the society would gather strength. We have to make full use of
that strength and knowledge. And I hope that our young men, who are now
restless, will become a great source of strength to our society and will be
able to give a new leadership to the country. I have full faith in them.
Sometimes some of them are led astray but most of them wish to become
an asset to their country. So all of us who are now not so young should
help these young men.
    We are citizens of an ancient country which is now becoming a
modern one. We would like to build up this country in such a manner that if
India's name is mentioned anywhere or if her citizens go anywhere, there
goes with them a new light, a new strength and a new ideology."
1969,Indira Gandhi,INC,New Horizons,"Free translation of speech in Hindi from the ramparts of Red Fort, Delhi, Independence Day, August 15, 1969","The years of endeavour: selected speeches of Indira Gandhi, August 1969-August 1972",NA,"We have assembled once again at this historic place. This day is a
milestone in our history and gives us an opportunity to look back on our
achievements and failures. At the same time it gives us an opportunity to
look ahead and see which way we want to go and which way we are going.
       I give you my best wishes on this day. This is the day when we think
with gratitude of our great leaders and the martyrs who laid down their lives
and sacrificed their all for the good of the country. We think of Mahatma
Gandhi, the Father of the Nation. We think of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose,
whose name is linked with this Red Fort. And what Shri Jawaharlal Nehru
has done for this country can be seen from one corner of the country to the
other.
       The Jallianwala Bagh massacre took place fifty years ago when a
large number of men, women and children, young and old alike, fell victim
to a storm of bullets. That was a turning point in the freedom struggle of our
country. We observed the 50th anniversary of the tragedy this year. Soon
after the massacre, we had pledged ourselves to complete Independence
on the banks of the Ravi. And then at Karachi, at Lucknow, at Avadi and at
Bhubaneswar, we took one big step after another along our chosen path.
      We all know what has happened in the country during these years
and the progress we have made in many directions. The production of
food-grains has increased. By the abolition of Zamindari we have tried to
relieve the distress of our oppressed peasants. The progress in the field of
industry is not merely confined to the expansion of existing industries but
includes the setting up of many important new industries after the
attainment of Independence. Our effort has been to establish big industries
only in the public sector and to abolish monopoly; but we know that we
have been successful in this only to a limited extent. Anyhow, some very
big industries have been established in the public sector; and more are
coming up. There has been some criticism of this sector, but if an honest
appraisal is made, we will find that on the whole these enterprises are
doing very well.
      Our peasants particularly are well aware of how they have benefited
from these projects. Their needs of water, electricity and many other things
have been met. We also know that there are a few industries which are not
running as satisfactorily as they should, but we are doing our best to
improve their condition. These industries are not the property of the
Government but of the people. The earlier they start yielding profits and the
better they function, the more the masses would benefit from them.
      Our country is forging ahead in every field. Of course, there have
been crises in the life of the nation. The wars on our frontiers, droughts,
communal riots and other disturbances—all these have done some harm to
the country. But these difficulties and calamities have also added to our
experience. We have learnt a lot from them and they have made our will
stronger and our steps more resolute.
        Today we can be sure that we have conquered the darkness. For the
first time in the last three or four years, there is brightness on the horizon.
Whereas many areas, cities and dwellings are bright with this light, we
cannot afford to forget those households which are still engulfed in
darkness. How can we forget those peasants whose lands have no
irrigation facilities; how can we forget the crores of Harijans and Girijans
[hill people] and members of backward tribes who live in mountains and
jungles and whose houses are still denied this brightness. We had given
them hope and assurance that after Independence they would have a
better life, but I am afraid their hopes have not been fulfilled.
       To accomplish these unfinished tasks, we will have to move more
resolutely towards the goal of socialism we have set ourselves. This path
has been chosen by the people of India through the democratic process
and it continues to have their approval. One very significant step in this
direction has been taken only recently. You all know what it is the
nationalisation of banks. I am fully conscious of the tremendous and
spontaneous reception it has received from the people. A large number of
people— big and small— came to meet me, wrote to me and sent me
messages, to tell me that this was a right step in the right direction.
      There still are many people for whom we have to do something.
Ricksha-wallas, tonga-wallas, stone-breakers— all these people come to
me. These are the people who are undergoing the worst hardships in our
big cities. We have to enable these people to share this new light and to
infuse in them a new hope for a better and richer life. No single step can
remove all their difficulties, but a beginning has to be made in improving
their condition or in helping them to change their professions. We have also
to solve the unemployment problem and to provide equal opportunities to
all.
      Our society, the Government, and the people, all of us have to unite
and help these down-trodden people and to assure them a new life. We are
forging ahead but sometimes suspicion and anger are created against the
minorities, giving rise to violence. This also disturbs our unity which, in turn,
disturbs the peace in the country. We all know that if peace is disturbed our
production cannot increase. Every section of the people has some
problems and difficulties and as we go ahead some new difficulties crop up
and we have to face them. For this we want all our strength, and this
strength can be conserved and utilised only when we work together to
solve each other's problems and difficulties.
       When banks were nationalised some rumours were set afloat that this
step was directed against a particular section of our society. I want to make
it perfectly clear that we do not propose to do anything against anybody.
We want all of us to march forward together. But I want to assure the rich
and the capitalists that the step that we have taken is not directed against
them. It is only in the interest of the people, and a measure which is in the
interest of the masses is in their interest also.
      I am pained to learn that some voices have been raised against the
step that we have taken. It has been said that banks were nationalised at
the instance of some foreign power. I want to make it perfectly clear that
whatever steps we are taking are at the behest of the masse and in the
interest of our democracy. I know that the spirit of democracy is well
entrenched in the hearts of the Indian people. I am also sure that they will
never do anything which may result in any harm to our country or which
may compromise our Independence.
      When Mahatma Gandhi started the freedom movement, a great
revolution took place in our country. But he brought about this revolution
with great humility and with the co-operation of all. He emancipated the
country from the clutches of a foreign power. The revolution that took place
has not ended yet, because in a fast changing world, our country and
society have to keep changing constantly.
       The path we have chosen is the right path. It is a path forged by our
history and culture. But why is it that, in spite of the considerable progress
we have made, the minds of some people are still disturbed and there is
dissatisfaction. Something seems to be lacking. Man wants something
more than progress and material advancement, and there comes a time in
man's life when a revolution emerges from his heart, from the innermost
recesses of his being and when he can recognise his soul more deeply and
can view his surroundings more clearly. Such a time has come in the life of
India today. There is a rush of fresh air caused by the sudden opening of a
door. Those accustomed to living in a closed atmosphere are worried by
the blowing of this breeze; but there are many others who are tired of
suffocation and would welcome the new strength and life they receive from
this breeze.
      Twenty-two years ago India awoke in freedom in the middle of the
night. My father declared on that memorable occasion that it was a tryst
with destiny. We have again reached a similar turning point and the future
is unfolding before us; we have to adopt new paths to take our country
rapidly ahead.
      This is the year of the Gandhi Centenary. We have not only to keep
the programmes of Gandhiji fresh in our memory but also to remember the
basic ideals and principles of Gandhiji and to familiarise the new generation
with them. Another great man is to visit our country in the near future. All of
you must have heard the name of Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan. He was the
greatest disciple of Gandhiji. Our people called him the Frontier Gandhi and
showered upon him deep respect and affection. I have no doubt that when
he visits India we will welcome him with the same affection.
      This is the age of science. This is also the age of the youth. They
have to follow new paths. They do not have to look towards anybody else,
because those who look towards others for guidance are left behind. We
have to show a new path to our young people. I know that they are
endowed with courage and determination. It is only by cultivating courage,
hope, self-reliance and self-confidence that we can make progress and
carry our masses forward.
       The tricolour we salute is a symbol of our democracy, of unity and
peace, of development and progress of our country. We have to cultivate
all these qualities in ourselves. It is our duty to preserve the honour of this
wheel of peace which was given to us by the great Ashoka.
      Standing before you here today, I can assure you that whatever I am
and whatever work I do, the paramount thing is that I will always work in
your interest, in the interest of the masses. In this connection I want to give
you the talisman which Gandhiji gave us. He had said that if you are
assailed by doubts while taking a step you should always think of the
lowliest and the weakest of our countrymen. If an action is going to improve
the lot of the poorest and the weakest then it is the right action, and if you
proceed on that path all your doubts will be removed. It is in this spirit that I
want to go ahead. We have made great progress but we have forgotten the
common man. Wherever we go we find brave slogans and nobody cares to
find out how these slogans are going to benefit the poor and the needy.
       Today we have taken a new turn. A new dawn has set in. I believe
that if the youth, the peasants and the labourers, whether they are in the
cities or in rural areas, follow this new path, they will bring about a new
wave of enthusiasm and produce a new spirit of sacrifice. We should
always think of the masses, of the poor people of the country. Only by
raising them can we raise ourselves. If we have strength and if we have
compassion in our hearts, then alone can we realise the difficulties of
others and sympathise with others; then alone can we accomplish big tasks
together. I have every reason to believe that the people of India will always
stand together in unity.
       Today, I give you all my good wishes. We have taken steps in a new
direction; new vistas have opened before us; and a cool and fresh breeze
is blowing about our faces. No one need be afraid of this fresh breeze. All
of us should march forward with courage. If we can do so, we can certainly
achieve something big.
       We have been a peaceful nation. At the same time we are aware that
peace does not mean weakness, that peace is achieved by strength,
self-reliance and self-confidence. I want every Indian cultivate these
qualities. Mahatma Gandhi produced freedom-fighters out of a poor and
defenceless people. We can further strengthen that spirit, because today
our people are more knowledgeable, more competent and more
determined than in the past.
      Many children are sitting in front of me. They are the citizens of
tomorrow and we expect great things from them. We want them to have
equal opportunities. We have to reduce the disparity between the high and
the low, between the rich and the poor, between one section of society and
another. We have also to reduce the gap between what we are and what
we want to become. Now let us raise the national slogan together. Jai Hind."
1968,Indira Gandhi,INC,Need for a National Perspective,"Free translation of speech in Hindi from the ramparts of Red Fort, Delhi, Independence Day, August 15, 1968","The years of challenge: Selected speeches of Indira Gandhi, January 1966-August 1969",NA,"Every year we assemble at Red Fort to celebrate Independence Day.
We have a long history behind us. But new India is only twenty-one years
old. During these twenty-one years, we have faced many problems—
drought, floods, famine and shortages. At the same time, we have seen
large development projects take shape before our eyes. These are our new
temples. In the midst of hopes and disappointments, we have continued to
march forward.
       Our people have faced innumerable difficulties with courage and
fortitude. I congratulate them for the courage displayed by them in facing
multifarious problems. We owe our strength to the sacrifices and the hard
work of our great leaders.
      On this day we take stock of the past and look at the future with hope.
Undoubtedly, we are a great nation. But let us not forget that we have a
long road to traverse. I have no doubt that if we follow the path shown by
our great leaders and hold fast to the principles laid down by them, we will
be able to achieve our goal without delay.
       It is a matter of regret that in this land of the Buddha, Akbar and
Gandhi, there should be violence. It is inevitable that in a country of the
size of India there should be differences among various sections of the
people. These differences should be settled across the table. It is the duty
of every citizen to assist in this process. We should help create conditions
in which violence does not thrive; we should not allow riots to take place. A
vast majority of our people are peace-loving. Why is it that a handful of
people are able to disturb peace? Harijans and people of other minority
communities have sometimes suffered atrocities. Several lives have been
lost. There has also been a loss of national resources. All this has
weakened the nation’s strength. There has also been an attempt to create
differences and doubts, which have the effect of undermining the
confidence of the people.
      Let us resolve on this day that we shall give no quarter to such
deleterious tendencies. Undoubtedly, the Government has a duty to
perform. But political parties, social organisations and the citizens of India
have also a responsibility to discharge. The reconstituted National
Integration Council has taken certain decisions which are being
implemented. I have every hope that we will succeed in creating a new
climate of peace and national integration in the country.
     Peace is the foundation of our progress. During the last twenty-one
years, we have strengthened this foundation. We are beginning to stand on
our own feet. After centuries of neglect, we are emerging; we are moving
towards self-reliance.
      We have witnessed a revolution in agriculture. We have had a
bumper crop. However, some parts are affected by drought, and some by
floods. Our hearts go out to those who have suffered as a result of drought
and floods. We are making every effort to relieve their suffering.
      Our bumper crop has been the result of a planned effort. Our kisans
[farmers] have made good use of the agricultural inputs provided to them.
Higher yields have not been the result of good rains alone. The revolution
in agriculture will impart strength to our economy. Industry will also benefit.
        The successes we have had should not blind us to certain problems.
Let us not forget that agricultural inputs have been made use of only by
farmers who enjoyed irrigation facilities. A vast majority of kisans do not
have irrigation facilities and were, therefore, unable to make good use of
agricultural inputs. This disparity between kisans possessing irrigation
facilities and those without irrigation facilities is growing. We have to ensure
that the ‘dry' farmers receive all possible assistant from us so that they can
play a useful role in stepping up agricultural production.
       Our industrial progress is to some extent dependent on agriculture.
Improved agricultural production has had a beneficial effect on our industry.
I have every hope that we will continue to make progress in this field. Last
year I had said on this occasion that India would soon emerge from her
difficulties. The dark days are ending. We have not solved all our problems.
But if we continue to march forward with determination, we will be able to
usher in a new era.
       As we make progress, we are faced with the rising expectations of
people. Several sections of people and several unions have made certain
demands. Some of these demands are just and need to be met. We have,
however, to realise that workers, teachers and office employees can voice
their demands but a vast majority of people who are illiterate, unskilled and
much poorer are unable to give expression to their demands. We cannot
ignore them. In taking a decision on the demands of organised sections of
the community, we have naturally to consider what effect the acceptance of
even just demands will have on those whose demands are unrepresented.
We have also to weigh very carefully what overall effect the acceptance of
demands will have on the general economic condition. I, therefore, appeal
to my brethren, be they workers, teachers or others, to view their demands
in the national perspective. We are fully seized of their difficulties and we
have all sympathy for them. Let them compare their own difficulties with
those of other sections of the community.
       When we talk of indiscipline among workers, I would like to say that
industrialists and moneyed businessmen cannot escape responsibility.
They cannot ensure discipline if they continue to make big profits and draw
fat salaries. I would appeal to them to give thought to this problem and find
a solution. We should be able to reduce the disparity between the rich and
the poor. If we want our country to prosper, we should subordinate
personal gain to the national good. We should develop a spirit of sacrifice.
Our aim should be more production. Every section of the community should
realise its responsibility to the nation. Then and then alone can we have
discipline and devolution of responsibility. We should also develop a spirit
of co-operation. We should not forget for a minute that our chief aim is to
eradicate poverty.
       We have the problem of unemployment among engineers and other
educated people. We are trying to solve this problem. We have to consider
how we can set up new industries and provide employment to a large
number of people. I would appeal to the educated people not to hankers
after government jobs. They should try and create new opportunities for
themselves. There is ample scope for them in our developing economy.
They should develop a spirit of self-help and self-reliance.
       We have invested hundreds of crores of rupees in our public sector
projects. This money does not belong to capitalists or industrialists. It is
public money. Profits made by public sector undertakings are spent on
public welfare—for building roads, schools, hospitals, etc. It is our duty to
ensure that public sector projects are run efficiently and successfully and
yield profits. The entire Indian public is a partner in these enterprises.
Workers and managers employed in public undertakings have a special
responsibility. Public sector undertakings suffer from many deficiencies. We
do not want to hide these deficiencies. But it does not mean that all public
sector undertakings are badly run. Some of them are being run very
efficiently.
      Our progress is dependent on national unity, on peace and on
economic and political stability. We have witnessed political changes in our
country recently. The prophets of gloom in India and abroad predicted that
our democracy would collapse. But the soundness of our democratic
structure has been fully vindicated. The Indian electorate is fully aware of
its democratic rights and I have every hope that it will always exercise
these rights with discretion and for the national good.
       Our actions produce repercussions in the international sphere. We
are living in a fast-moving world. Each country is trying to cultivate and
maintain friendly relations with other countries. No nation severs relations
with another even if there are differences between the two. Even friendly
countries do not wish to be involved when there are disputes.
      India has always followed a policy of non-alignment and of judging
every issue on its merits. Other countries are also taking to this policy. Old
alignments are weakening.
      The Soviet Union recently decided to sell arms to Pakistan. This
decision caused us concern. In our view it was an unfortunate decision. But
we should not be unduly perturbed. We should not present to the world the
picture of a grumbling, discontented and scared nation. We are a strong
nation. During the last two years, we have taken steps to make the nation
stronger. Our troops are guarding our frontiers with courage. No matter
what other countries say, we should have faith in our own strength. In the
present-day world, real strength is not military strength alone. We have to
have a sound industrial base and a united nation. We should not lose faith
in our ability and capacity to defend ourselves.
     Are we succumbing to pressures from any nation? I want to declare
categorically that India shall not succumb to any pressure. Men of strong
conviction never succumb and we have a firm conviction and a strong
determination.
       We have had differences with Pakistan. Perhaps, these differences
are due to the fact that we have had close relations. Sometimes brothers
develop serious differences. aggression and of hostile propaganda. We
have been the victims of aggression and of hostile propaganda. In spite of
this, Pandit Nehru and Shri Lal Bahadur Shastri offered a No-War Pact to
Pakistan. On this day, I once again commend a No-War Pact for Pakistan’s
consideration. A No-War Pact will be of mutual advantage to both and will
afford us an opportunity to face internal problems and to make progress.
      Swami Vivekananda had said, ""Blessed are those who take birth in
this Great Land.” It is equally true that blessed is the nation where great
men are born. One such great man was Mahatma Gandhi. In October this
year, we begin the centenary celebrations of his birth. Gandhiji had
enunciated some noble principles which are as valid today as they were
during his lifetime. These principles will have validity even in the future.
Gandhiji had dedicated his life to the service of Harijans, the poor and the
backward people. He sacrificed his life to maintain unity. We have to learn
a lesson from his teachings and the noble principles enunciated by him.
       Naturally on this day we think of the youth of India. They are the
backbone of India. The strength of the nation depends on their strength.
There is ferment in the minds of the youth in India and elsewhere in the
world. There are many reasons for this ferment. Perhaps one reason is that
traditional methods cannot provide a solution to problems of the new age.
We can provide leadership to the youth only up to a point. From that point,
they have to carve out a new path for themselves and for the nation's
future. They will have to face many difficulties and challenges. They have
either to climb the mountain of difficulties or cut through it. There is no other
way. Our hopes are pinned on the youth of India. They can impart strength
to the nation in many fields. I have every hope that they will engage in the
mighty endeavour of building a great nation. Their energy and their
enthusiasm will be a source of inspiration and encouragement to the entire
nation.
       Brothers and sisters, the welfare of each one of us is indissolubly
linked with a prosperous India. We should forget our own difficulties and
only think of making India strong and prosperous. We should face unitedly
the many problems facing us. No matter where we are— in the plains, in
the hills, on the borders or the sea-coast— we are all citizens of this great
country. We should not do anything, wittingly or unwittingly, which will lower
the prestige of the country. We should so conduct ourselves that the future
generations remember us for laying the foundation of a strong nation for
ushering in a new era.
      I congratulate you all on the occasion of the twenty-first anniversary
of India. I congratulate the kisans who, through their hard work, have
solved the food problem to some extent. I congratulate the industrial
workers for their effort in increasing production. congratulate all others who
have faced difficulties with courage.
    I call upon the people to join hands in making this ancient land a
modern, powerful and prosperous nation.
       Gandhiji's selfless service has left an imprint on history. He will be
remembered for all times to come. We should draw inspiration from his
teachings and his noble principles and make an effort translate his dream
into reality.
    On this day, as I speak to you from the ramparts of Red Fort two
names that are associated with Red Fort come to mind. Netaji Subhas
Chandra Bose had exhorted the ‘Indian National Army' to march to the Red
Fort. He had also given us the 'Jai Hind' slogan. Pandit Nehru carried this
slogan to every nook and corner of India. Today this slogan has become a
symbol of our unity and strength. Jai Hind."
1967,Indira Gandhi,INC,Towards a Better Life,"Free translation of speech in Hindi from the ramparts of Red Fort, Delhi, Independence Day, August 15, 1967","The years of challenge: Selected speeches of Indira Gandhi, January 1966-August 1969",NA,"For the second successive year, I have unfurled the National Flag on
Red Fort. You will recall that last year we were drenched in rain on this
occasion and there were earth tremors. The tremors were said to be a
warning of coming difficulties. While on this day last year we stood in rain,
there was a severe drought in many parts of the country. The people were
faced with immense difficulties. Today, at this time, there is no rain here,
but India is having an excellent monsoon. Let us hope that we have the
required rainfall and the country will new turn. Let us hope there will be no
more drought and food shortages. Let us hope that we will begin a new life.
       The people in the drought-affected areas have faced innumerable
difficulties with great courage and fortitude. This is not surprising. Our
people have always been known to overcome difficulties. Our people have
gone through difficult times in the past; they have faced many aggressions.
      Why has the Red Fort been chosen for this ceremony? Because it is
in Delhi, which is the door-step of India. The banner of freedom was raised
here on many occasions. When the last battle of freedom was fought and
the country was partitioned and there were riots, the message of unity and
independence went out from here.
       The people of India have survived many crises. Today, there is a
feeling of despondency in the country. Only a few days ago; we observed
the 25th anniversary of the Quit India movement. Twenty-five years ago
there was gloom in the world. The world was in the midst of World War II.
At that time, Gandhiji gave us the ‘do or die’ message to achieve
deliverance from foreign rule. There was not a ray of hope of India
becoming free. But in a short period of five years our dream came true.
From this we have to learn the lesson that gloom is not perpetual. The
darkness will end soon and the dawn is near. We will soon overcome our
difficulties. We need courage and determination to do so.
       Much has happened during the last twenty years. Perhaps we could
have achieved much more. Nevertheless, our achievements are many. A
new generation has been born. It is not aware that India lived in slavery. It
is not aware of our freedom struggle. It is not aware that the poor and
hungry masses of India fought the mighty battle of freedom and won.
      Some voices are raised that there has been no improvement in the lot
of the Indian people. Publicity is given to it in India and abroad. But if we
look around we will find that, while milk, sugar and other articles of daily
necessity were cheaper in the past, there avenues of progress for the
people. There were few facilities for the education of children. The living
conditions of farmers and other rural folk were not satisfactory. Their
children did not attend school. They did not own bicycles. The spirit of
enterprise was lacking. We have definitely made progress during the last
twenty years. Maybe the pace of progress has not been fast enough, but it
has been continuous.
       Rural folk are aware of the difficulty of having to wade or swim across
swollen rivers and rivulets during the monsoon. The current flows most
swiftly in midstream and it is there too that the water is deepest. India is in
a somewhat similar situation. We are in midstream. I have no doubt that,
given courage and determination, the people of India will be able to cross
the deep waters and reach the other bank. We cannot afford to look back;
we cannot afford to wait even for a single second. We must continue our
progress. We must cross the swollen river. Once across, our progress will
be easier.
       Violence has no place in India. We must fight communalism, linguism
and casteism if we have to make speedier progress. Regionalism also
poses a danger. One can understand the desire of every State to make
progress but no individual or State can make progress in isolation. We
must keep the picture of a united India before us all the time. We have
faced many challenges and many difficulties in the past. We have always
overcome them. Today we are faced with food shortages not in one State
but in many parts of the country. Food shortages have created a new
problem and new doubts in our minds. We may recall that when India
became free, we were assailed with doubts whether we would be able to
form a stable Government and maintain the unity of the country. After the
partition of the country, there was aggression on Kashmir. Later Gandhiji
was assassinated. Our great leaders left us one by one. However, side by
side, the people of India gained strength. The vast mass of people living in
every part of India are the nation's real strength.
     We have undoubtedly made progress in the economic sphere. We
have set up new industries. We have increased agricultural production. We
have to maintain the rate of progress in the agricultural and industrial fields.
      We have made every effort to reach food-grains to deficit areas. You
are aware that West Bengal, Kerala, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and many other
parts of the country are faced with food shortages. Through the efforts of
the Government and non-official organisations, the needs of the people
were met to some extent. I would like to congratulate the people of these
States for the courage with which they faced difficulties. They have upheld
the honour of India. They have shown that a free nation is capable of
overcoming difficulties.
       The people of India are faced with many other problems. There is the
problem of rising prices. There is a demand for higher wages. This problem
is not confined to India. The whole world is faced with the problem of rising
prices and the demand for higher wages. It is a vicious circle of rising
prices, higher rents, higher wages and again higher prices. It is our
endeavour to break this vicious circle. We want to stabilise prices. We have
all to co-operate to solve this problem. We have to make sacrifices. We
should restrict our purchases of consumer goods. It is not an easy problem.
The poorer sections of the community are the worst sufferers. I have the
greatest sympathy for them. We have to find ways and means of solving
this problem.
      I know that everyone wants an increase in his wages. People are also
worried that they can buy very little even with increased wages. We have to
find a solution to the problem of people's needs. We have limited
resources. We have to consider ways and means of augmenting our
resources. If we can increase our resources by suffering hardship, we
should not hesitate to do so. Then our difficulties will end soon.
      Our Constitution envisages the formation of Governments by different
parties in different States. Today we have Governments of different
complexions. They have freedom to follow their own paths. It has always
been our endeavour to extend the fullest co-operation to them. Sometimes,
perhaps in anger, or perhaps because of their helplessness in the face of
difficulties, the States accuse us of discriminatory treatment. The charge of
discrimination is absolutely baseless. India is one nation. We treat all
citizens equally. All States are equal in our eyes. It is our endeavour to
ensure equitable distribution of food and other resources. We want to
remove the difficulties of all. Bu as our resources are limited, we can only
share what we have. I do hope that the people will appreciate our difficulty
and co-operate with us.
       We have taken up many projects for the development of the country.
We have spread education. Progress in such fields as women’s welfare,
development of communications and brought many changes. We have
opened up new vistas of progress. But as we progress in new fields, new
difficulties arise. All sections of the community are faced with difficulties.
Unrest is a world phenomenon, whether it is among students or other
sections. There are problems of race, language or other similar problems
facing various countries. We should not magnify our difficulties.
      Two years ago, our leaders put forward a proposal that education up
to the university level should be in the mother tongue so that the benefits of
education could reach everyone and the talents of the people could find a
natural outlet. Can we achieve this ? Even a good proposal sometimes
contains the seeds of danger. It is feared that this proposal might
encourage separatism. This proposal could prove beneficial if there is a link
language which can bind the people together and thus help maintain
national unity. Similarly, there is need to maintain links with the world. We
cannot afford to live in isolation in the present-day world. It will prove
harmful to our interests. Therefore, there should be three languages— the
regional language, a national link-language and an international language.
We have to keep in view the difficulties of the people in the matter of
language. We have to consider how the difficulties of the people in various
parts of the country can be minimised and how they can be helped in every
possible way. No one should have the feeling that something is being thrust
on him or that impediments are being put in his path.
       Sometimes we think that a particular view is beneficial to the people
at large. But there are people holding other views. In this matter we have to
carry the people with us. We cannot ignore the views of others. We have to
find a solution which is acceptable to all, and which does not weaken our
democratic structure or our national unity. The question of language
generates emotion and anger. If a proper solution is found, language can
become a force for national unity and national progress.
      Regional tendencies have been on the increase. The people of each
State think that if development schemes are implemented in that particular
State, India will make rapid progress. Unfortunately, our resources are
limited. We have to determine an order of priorities for different
development schemes. We must look upon all States as our own. There is
no need to feel upset if a development scheme is implemented in another
State. We should be patient. Gradually, all development schemes will be
implemented. We should draw inspiration from our past when we overcame
innumerable difficulties.
      We need peace for our progress. We want peace at home and
abroad. We stand for world peace. There are tensions sometimes. All kinds
of questions arise. There are tensions even in a family, between brothers
and sisters. We have always stood for a peaceful solution of all questions.
It has always been and continues to be our endeavour that all questions
should be solved through peaceful means. But if there is aggression on our
borders, we will meet it with all our might. A few days ago, I visited some
forward areas. Our officers and Jawans are guarding our borders with
courage. They are not deterred by adverse weather conditions. I have seen
them guard the snowy mountains. I assured them that the entire nation was
behind them. I conveyed to them the good wishes of the Government and
people of India. I have full confidence that the honour of India is safe in the
hands of our Armed Forces. Let us not forget that we have a responsibility
too. Our officers and Jawans are bearing hardship and are prepared to
sacrifice their lives to protect the territorial integrity of India. We should also
be ready to bear hardship and make sacrifices. We should keep in view our
objectives.
      What is socialism ? There are differing definitions. A simple definition
of socialism is that poverty should be eradicated; disparities between the
rich and the poor should be reduced; the backward people- be they
Harijans, adivasis or the hill people— should have equal opportunities to
make progress; and there should be equal distribution of national
resources. This is our socialism and this is our goal. We want to achieve
this goal rapidly.
       Sons and daughters of India— be you workers or kisans [farmers],
businessmen or industrialists, teachers or students, writers or artists— you
are all inhabitants of this great country. You should not forget this for a
moment. Through your veins runs the blood of heroes, and great men. Let
diffidence give way to confidence; let despair give way to hope. We will
then be able to build a strong nation; we will then be able to raise the
structure of a beautiful Bharat. We are capable of doing so. We have
embarked on an exciting venture. We shall face every difficulty— be it war
or famine— with courage and determination. We shall not let the nation go
under.
      My countrymen, join me with all your heart in raising the national
slogan. Let this slogan echo all over. Let it be a symbol of our national
strength. Let it guide us towards national progress. Jai Hind."
1966,Indira Gandhi,INC,A New Revolution,"Free translation of speech in Hindi from Day, August 15, 1966","The years of challenge: Selected speeches of Indira Gandhi, January 1966-August 1969",NA,"I greet my countrymen on this historic day from this historic place.
There are certain historic events which leave a deep impress on the life of
every individual. Our Independence is one such event. Independence Day
has special significance for us because on this day we began a new life.
On this day, nineteen years ago, the first Prime Minister of India,
Jawaharlal Nehru, unfurled the national flag from the ramparts of Red Fort.
On this day, he lit the torch of freedom and laid the foundation of
Independent India.
       On this day, our minds turn to our great leaders and to innumerable
people from all parts of the country who flung themselves into the freedom
struggle and made immense sacrifices. They were truly great men. We owe
our freedom to their courage, forbearance and sacrifice. The responsibility
of following the path shown by these great sons of India has devolved on
us.
        Standing here on the ramparts of Red Fort, my mind inevitably turns
to India's past—a past studded with achievements in the fields of science
and philosophy and in other fields. India was an advanced nation and had
provided leadership to the world. How can we forget India's glorious past?
It is for us to see that our record remains unblemished.
      On this occasion, we naturally think of the Father of the Nation.
Jawaharlal Nehru had once described Mahatma Gandhi as a magician.
Despite his belief in science and the new world, Jawaharlal Nehru felt that
the path shown by Mahatma Gandhi was the right path. Nonviolence', 'truth'
and swadeshi summed up Gandhiji's message. It is my firm belief that this
message still holds good.
      Non-violence means that we should live in peace and amity, and
entertain respect for one another's views. It also means that we should
entertain respect for nations professing different ideologies.
      Similarly, we want truth to pervade all our actions. Fearlessness is an
essential part of truth. We should be as fearless today as we were during
the struggle for freedom. We should not be afraid of making mistakes. We
should not be afraid of making changes. We should be willing to adopt new
paths and to imbibe new ideas. It is very necessary for us to have a
complete understanding of the problems facing us. Only then can we find
the way out.
      Swadeshi is the third part of Gandhiji's message. The country is faced
with economic difficulties. We can improve the economic situation by
imbibing the spirit of swadeshi. Swadeshi does not mean that we do not
import at all. It only means that we should exercise the utmost economy,
patronise our own goods and make full use of available resources. If,
however, it becomes necessary to import with a view to learning new
techniques, we should not hesitate to do so. The responsibility for
popularising the swadeshi movement does not rest with the Government
alone. Every citizen, be he a villager or a town-dweller, has to play an
important part in popularising it.
      We have accepted the socialist path because we feel that there is no
other way of eradicating poverty. Democracy is the base of our socialism.
Democracy confers many rights on the individual. These rights have
corresponding duties. Our greatest duty is to help the nation achieve
progress. We have launched many development programmes. The
purpose of these programmes is the removal of poverty. We have to wage
a relentless war against poverty. I appeal to my countrymen to join in this
battle.
      The peasantry is the most important wing of our society. Peasants
are the predominant section of our population. I appeal to them to adopt
modern techniques of agricultural production. I also need their
Co-operation in bringing about reforms in rural life.
       The role of labour is equally important. A great responsibility rests on
their shoulders to increase production for defence and for other purposes.
By increasing production, they will improve their own living standards and
also help the nation in its march towards progress.
      Our brave Jawans [soldiers] are guarding our frontiers. Our hearts go
out to them. Let us remember that our defences lie not on the Himalayas
but in every village, every town and every city. The peasant, the labourer,
the industrialist, the businessman, the team and the employee have all an
equally great responsibility in this task. Each one of them should discharge
this responsibility faithfully.
      Artists, writers and thinkers, too, have a responsibility. This is to show
the nation the right path. They should not hesitate to imbibe new ideas from
abroad. They should also see that our own ideas flow to other countries.
       We have to continue our march towards progress. There can be no
let-up. Many sections of our society have suffered from neglect for
centuries. There are the Harijans, the adivasis [tribal people], the hill people
and the minorities. We pay special attention to them. We have drawn up
programmes for their welfare. But much more remains to be done. I am
fully aware of their difficulties. Some of them suffered hardship during the
recent drought. Without their uplift, the nation cannot make much progress.
I appeal for their co-operation in the tasks facing the nation.
       Then, there are the women of India, belonging to all sections of
society and engaged in multifarious tasks. They carry the responsibility of
running the home, of bringing up the new generation and of braving the
difficulties arising from spiralling prices. Women constitute 50 per cent of
the country's population. For centuries, they have imparted strength to the
nation. For centuries, they have upheld the noble traditions of India. We
look to them again to maintain the high traditions of our culture. They
continue to be the source of the nation's strength. We look to them for
inspiration.
     Innumerable people participated in the struggle for freedom. Many of
them are not in our midst today. On this day, we pay our homage to them.
Some of our freedom fighters are old. We are benefiting by their
experience.
       A new generation of Indians is coming up. They were not witness to
the freedom struggle. They are not aware of the fervour which impelled us
to fight for freedom. The responsibility for the nation’s progress and
development falls on them as much as it falls on those who were
associated with the struggle for freedom.
       We are faced with threats on our borders. We are also faced with the
threat of poverty and backwardness inside the country. We cannot fight the
battle against poverty successfully unless we accept new ideas, unless we
do away with superstition, unless we work with dedication and
determination to attain progress, unless we are prepared to make sacrifices
in the face of difficulties. It is the duty of every individual to lend his
co-operation in this great task. No one can absolve himself of this
responsibility. We cannot remain idle spectators. We are all soldiers in the
fight against poverty.
      At the time of aggression on our borders, our young men, our
students, offered to lay down their lives to defend the country's territorial
integrity. They were ready to write with their blood a new chapter in the
history of India. The nation beckons to them again. They should be ready to
take up the challenge. They have to infuse new life into the nation. They
have to regenerate the nation.
       We are assembled at the historic Red Fort today. The eyes of the
entire nation are focused on us. We have the panorama of Indian history
behind us and we have the vision of a bright future ahead. Every citizen
should ask himself what he can contribute to the making of a bright future
for the country. He should ask himself whether the nation's policies and
programmes can be successfully implemented. On the answer to this
question depends our progress. If the people are assailed by doubts and
hesitation, difficulties will naturally arise. But if they are resolute in
accepting the challenge, the nation can face both external and internal
dangers and march towards progress. It is not an easy task; we never had
any illusions about it. We may have made mistakes. We may not have
moved with speed. But many of our difficulties are the result of the process
of change and development itself. If we had remained static, our difficulties
may not have increased, but we would have remained a poor and
backward nation. We have deliberately chosen the more difficult path of
change and progress.
      Let us recapture the fervour which characterised our freedom
struggle, and work with dedication for a new revolution which will energise
the whole nation and inspire us to answer the call of our motherland. I have
absolutely no doubt that we have it in us to achieve great things. But if we
stray from the right path, we will be heading towards ruin, and the sacrifices
of the great sons of India would have been in vain. Let us draw inspiration
from those who fought for freedom and kept the nation's flag flying.
       We extend our hand to all friendly nations. Our sympathies are with
the victims of colonialism. We will continue to raise our voice against
injustice and war everywhere. We want the subject peoples, the victims of
oppression everywhere in the world, to breathe the air of freedom and to
have full opportunities for progress.
       I take a pledge on this day to work for the nation's uplift and to fight
injustice everywhere. If we march unitedly as disciplined soldiers along the
path shown by Gandhiji and Jawaharlal Nehru, we can make India a great
nation. Let us all take this pledge.
       I call upon you to join me in raising the great slogan given us by
Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose. This slogan represents our strength. Join me
in raising the slogan three times. Your voice is the voice of a great nation. It
should reach the far-off mountains and every nook and corner of India. It
should inspire courage and self-confidence in every Indian. Jai Hind, Jai
Hind, Jai Hind."
1965,L.B. Shastri,INC,Invasion Will Be Repulsed,"From the speech at Red Fort on August 15, 1965","Selected speeches of Lal Bahadur Shastri, June 11, 1964 to January 10, 1966",NA,"A few days back, we were attacked by Pakistan in the Rann of Kutch.
We faced the attack adequately. We had made it clear that unless Pakistan
withdrew from Kutch completely, there would be no talks. This has been
achieved. Pakistan has withdrawn from Kutch. She has no troops, no police
and no posts in Kutch. India has complete civil control over the territory. An
Agreement to this effect was signed. India accepted the Agreement as she
was not in favour of disturbance of peace in any part of the world.
       Even while we were negotiating about the implementation of this
agreement. Pakistan invaded Kashmir. I use the word invasion deliberately.
It is absurd to say that civilian raiders have infiltrated into Kashmir from the
Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. Pakistan must bear full responsibility for the
attack. Pakistan had banked upon an internal revolt in the wake of that
attack. Pakistan intends to step up trouble in Kashmir. Under the
circumstances, there is absolutely no scope for talks. We cannot even think
of that. We want peace in Kashmir. But when we are attacked, it becomes
the responsibility of the Government to meet force with force.
      The people of Kashmir are facing the situation courageously. The
Muslims, Hindus and Sikhs of Kashmir have stood up against the raiders
unitedly. They are determined to throw out the raiders. The Kashmir
Government headed by Shri G.M. Sadiq has handled the situation with
courage. I congratulate the Kashmir Government and my brothers and
sisters in Kashmir for their valour. On behalf of you all, I assure them that
the nation stands solidly behind them, and our entire strength and
resources are with them. We will throw out each one of the raiders. Our
armed forces and our police are defending the border with courage. We are
grateful to them.
      A great responsibility rests on us. We must sink our differences.
There is no place for agitations, hartals and movements. We have to march
forward unitedly in order to remove the threat to our territorial integrity. If
there are disturbances in the country, how can we defend our borders with
single-minded devotion? We should eschew communalism and casteism.
      What is happening in Kashmir might not end in a matter of days. It is
not as if the raiders would withdraw in a day or two. It is difficult to say how
long this threat would last. Pakistan intended to annex Kashmir by force
and it is likely that she would make it a prestige issue. We have our
national self-respect too; we have certain responsibilities to discharge. I
want to state categorically that Pakistan will not be allowed to take even an
inch of our territory in Kashmir.
       I am confident that every Indian will heed my appeal for unity and
peace. We have to defend our borders and defeat the designs of those who
cast an evil eye on us. The honour of the flag under which we stand today
has to be upheld. We may perish, but we will not allow the honour of our
flag to be sullied. India will continue to progress and prosper."
1964,L.B. Shastri,INC,Building a Strong Country,"Speech from the Red Fort on August 15, 1964","Selected speeches of Lal Bahadur Shastri, June 11, 1964 to January 10, 1966",NA,"Brothers and Sisters: As I stand here today I recall how we took a
vow to plant the national flag on the Red Fort forty years ago when we
were volunteers in the national movement. It was our brave leader,
Jawaharlalji, who inspired this idea. We can never forget him. He was one
of the greatest leaders of the freedom struggle; and after winning
Independence he launched the massive task of India's reconstruction. For
seventeen years he worked unceasingly, day and night, to consolidate our
freedom.
       We all remember the joy and enthusiasm which surged through the
country on August, 15, 1947, when we regained our long-lost freedom. For
seventeen years, you witnessed every year the unforgettable scene of
Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru standing at this spot and unfurling the national
flag. We cannot forget the dignity and courage with which he led the
country. He became a part of our life. Now he is no longer with us. His
inspiring voice is mute but he has left us an invaluable heritage which we
must preserve. We have to surmount the difficulties that face us and work
steadfastly for the happiness and prosperity of our country.
       The food problem has become very acute during the last month and a
half. The States of U.P., Bihar, Bengal, Maharashtra, Gujarat and a part of
Rajasthan are facing food scarcity. I can assure you that we are doing our
best to meet this situation. We have rushed foodgrains from surplus States
like Punjab, Orissa, Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh and also from
imported stocks. Though we are not yet out of the woods, there has been a
perceptible improvement. We will have to intensify our efforts during the
coming months. We will also have to limit our consumption and help to feed
those of our countrymen who are less fortunate than ourselves. We should
not store foodgrains in excess of our requirements. I am confident that we
will face this problem with courage and far-sightedness. We will have to
stop lavish feasts during the coming two or three months. Ministers will not
participate in feasts and will not hold any parties. This may not result in
much saving of foodgrains but it will have a psychological effect and set a
good example before the people.
       The basic question to which we have to address ourselves is that of
increasing the production of foodgrains. I do not want to go into the details
of the steps we are going to take. Broadly, we want to assure a fair price to
the producers and procure grain without causing hardship. I am sure we
will be able to improve our position considerably within a year or two.
       I do not want to minimise the other problems that face us. The prices
of everyday necessities like cloth, oil, sugar and matches have risen. This
has naturally affected the farmer also. During the last 15 years we have
invested Rs. 20,000 crores in our development plans. Unless this huge
investment results in a corresponding increase in production, it is bound to
lead to inflation and high prices. We will have to devise steps to arrest
rising prices. There is no question of going back on our objective of
establishing a new revolutionary society but we will have to take firm action
to control prices. I am confident that the Government will be able to find a
way out of the present economic difficulties.
      I want to ensure that essential commodities are available at fair prices
during the coming years. I am not very much concerned about the prices of
luxury goods but I do want the common man to be able to get food, cloth
and articles of everyday use at a fair price. Every shop will have to display
a price-list and Government officials will have to enforce it strictly.
       We want peace at home and abroad. We have to pay particular
attention to our relations with our neighbours. The Chinese invaded our
country. Their attitude has not changed. Therefore we cannot change our
attitude either. In consonance with the principles laid down by Gandhiji and
Jawaharlalji we are always prepared to hold talks, consistent with our
dignity and self-respect; but our country is not going to bow down to any
threat of force or of an atomic bomb. We are confident of the
strength of our people, and are capable of facing every danger. I am happy
that President Ayub Khan has expressed friendly sentiments for India. I
welcome his plea for amity between India and Pakistan. We also desire
amity. Border incidents are not good either for Pakistan or for India. It also
does not redound to our credit that we are not able to stop the migration of
lakhs of people from across the border. I hope that we shall be able to hold
talks within the next few months and create an atmosphere of goodwill
which may lead to a settlement.
       We have friendly relations with our neighbours—Burma, Ceylon,
Nepal and Afghanistan. Some problems do crop up sometimes. I am happy
that the Prime Minister of Ceylon has accepted our invitation to come here
during October. I am confident that we will be able to find a solution to the
problem of the people of Indian origin in Ceylon. Our Foreign Minister,
Sardar Swaran Singh, is going to Burma, and I hope he will be able to
resolve the present difficulties with that country.
       Jawaharlalji showed us the path of peace. We will work for world
peace with all our strength. We will steer clear of alignment with power
blocs and pursue an independent policy. We adhere to the policy of
non-alignment, co-existence, disarmament, anti-colonialism and
anti-racialism. We are firmly opposed to colonialism and we want to see the
end of Portuguese colonialism. We cannot tolerate racial policies, whether
in South Africa or elsewhere. We stand for truth and justice, not in an
aggressive manner but with dignity and restraint.
      We can win respect in the world only if we are strong internally and
can banish poverty and unemployment from our country. Above all we
need national unity. Communal, provincial and linguistic conflicts weaken
the country. Therefore, we have to forge national unity. I appeal to all to
work for national unity and usher in a social revolution to make our country
strong.
      In the ultimate analysis, the strength of the country does not lie in
material wealth alone. A country is made strong by people like Gandhi,
Jawaharlal and Tagore; by the force of character and moral strength.
Therefore, I appeal to our young men to inculcate in themselves discipline
and character and work for the unity and advancement of the nation. If our
young men and women work in this spirit, I have no doubt that the future of
our country will be bright."
1963,Jawaharlal Nehru,INC,The Sixteenth Year,"English rendering of the Independence Day address, delivered in Hindi, Delhi, August 15, 1963","Jawaharlal Nehru, Selected Speeches, Volume 5 (1963-1964)",NA,"We are again assembled here today on this auspicious occasion of
the sixteenth anniversary of free India. Sixteen years ago today, we met
here, below the Red Fort, and our National Flag fluttered here for the first
time. We shall never forget that day when India attained freedom after a
long and hard struggle and great suffering. We were kind of intoxicated with
happiness and celebrated the day with fervour. We thought our days of toil
were over and we would be able to build our country. But, very soon, the
country was overtaken by a terrible calamity. In the wake of the partition of
the country, there were riots in Pakistan and on this side of the border.
These were ghastly events which shocked us and pained us. But we faced
the situation and gradually brought it under control. Then came the
assassination of Mahatmaji at the hands of an Indian. We could not have
suffered a more rigorous sentence. Nevertheless, we asked ourselves what
Gandhiji would have wanted us to do—would he want us to mourn and
bewail or fight those evil forces and ideologies which could destroy the
country. We faced them and triumphed over those forces.
        A fresh wind began to blow again across the country and we decided
to devote all our energies to build a new and prosperous India so that the
people could move forward and strengthen the nation. Big plans were
prepared which we have been implementing for the last 10 or 12 years. I
believe, and I think you will agree with me, that the face of India has
changed in these 10 or 12 years and is still changing. New cities have been
built, thousands of new factories have been set up. Projects have been
implemented and everywhere a measure of prosperity is discernible. No
doubt, we are still very far from our goal. But these achievements cannot
be denied. In recent years, our attention has, however, strayed from the
fundamentals. We became complacent and felt that our freedom was
secure and there was none who could threaten it. We had not yet grasped
that freedom is not secure by itself. We did not realize that freedom calls for
eternal vigilance, year in and year out, day in and day out. In the absence
of vigilance, dangers arise. We had become standard-bearers of peace in
the world and India was rightly regarded as a country which stood for
peace. We still stand for peace. But weakness goes ill together with peace.
Peace can be secured by strength and endeavour, not by complacency.
That way alone can peace be secure in the world and our voice can be
heard with respect.
       All of a sudden, aggression was committed on our borders last year
by a country which we had looked upon as a friend. This naturally shocked
us and we had to pass through hardships and difficulties. This also had its
good consequences, because we were shaken out of our complacency and
once again a climate of preparedness and sacrifice was generated. I still
remember how our people, the ordinary people, offered to the nation all
their possessions, cash, gold and silver. Those who had the least gave the
most. People forgot their mutual conflicts, put them aside and realized that
their first duty was to face the danger to the freedom of the country. The
spirit of unity manifested itself in the country, which proved that
notwithstanding the apparent differences, there is an underlying unity which
comes to surface at the right time.
       Our morale was high. We strove to prepare for defence and to raise
our strength, and the country did become strong. But popular enthusiasm is
not enough preparedness. Preparing for the defence of the country means
a thousand different activities to make the equipment and material which
the defence forces need. Backing this all, are the countless farms of India
which produce foodgrains and other foodstuff. Preparedness therefore
means all-round effort, everyone in this place striving hard to produce to
the limit of his capacity so that our economy is strengthened. We have
attended to these matters and some progress has been made and is still
continuing.
       But again the state of complacency is returning because the
hostilities have ended. In place of the unity and harmony that were
witnessed, the old controversies and conflicts which weaken the country
have reappeared. Unfortunately, this is our old failing, reasserting itself
when we are not face to face with danger. But we are facing continuous
danger on our borders and it becomes our first task to defend the country
against it. Other things can wait. Who will respect that country which cannot
defend its independence and its territorial integrity? Such a nation is even
powerless to make any progress. No doubt, at this moment the biggest task
facing us is to raise the strength of the country, increase production and
banish poverty so that everyone has an equal opportunity for progress, and
the millions of our people and our children have a chance to lead a better
life and to get the good things of life. But all this presupposes that we
uphold our honour and make our freedom secure. Any slackening in this
respect will leave the country disheartened, weak, powerless. A free
country which wants to maintain its freedom gives top priority to its
defences. Everything else comes afterwards. On this question there can be
no argument, although there is scope for discussion. We have to speak
with one voice. The unity of India, which is most vital to us, comes first—the
unity which manifested itself last year and early this year but which we
have been neglecting after the fighting stopped. It is unfortunate that again
conflicting and dissenting voices have begun to be heard and small and big
controversies have erupted.
        Ours is a free country and everyone has a right to free discussion and
criticism which one can freely exercise. But with rights go duties and
obligations. Anyone who neglects his duties cannot protect his rights. The
national duty today is to defend the country, to maintain unity and increase
the nation's strength, irrespective of religion or State. Everybody has his
rights but if we neglect this duty we weaken our claim to those rights. There
are several rights which cannot be fully operated today. All our citizens are
entitled to a happy life, to be freed of the burden of poverty and to expect
opportunities of progress for their children. We are marching towards that
goal and we that the day will come when it will be achieved. The fact,
however, remains that we are far from that goal and we can reach it only
when we fulfil our duties.
       When I say that the country is facing dangers on the borders, I am
not suggesting that something is about to happen. Rather that this new
situation that has arisen has created new dangers on our borders, which
we appear to have forgotten. Of course, we have to station our troops and
our Air Force to guard against this menace, but the Army or the Air Force
alone cannot protect the country. Nowadays, the defence of the country
requires all the people, men and women, to do something or the other in
that cause. The defences have to be strengthened by the endeavour of the
entire nation, by its unity and ability to work together, in farms and factories
or wherever we happen to be. We should all prepare ourselves to meet the
danger so that we could strengthen our country and thus strengthen the
Army.
       It is a strange world in which we live, a world which is changing. On
the one hand, there is a danger of a world war in which nuclear weapons
may be used. On the other hand, there are also some favourable trends.
Recently a treaty was concluded in Moscow on nuclear tests by the United
States, the Soviet Union and Britain. We and other countries acceded to
the treaty later. The agreement does not eliminate the danger of war but it
shows a way to bring war and warlike tendencies under control and to
ensure peace in the world. Seven or eight years ago, we had made this
proposal in the United Nations, which it has now given the shape of a treaty
in Moscow. We were the first to raise our voice for this kind of arrangement.
We are, therefore, particularly happy that our proposal has been acted
upon and hope that a move having been initiated, further progress will
continue to be made and the world would be rid of the nuclear danger.
Young men and women today face a life full of dangers as well as hopes. It
is a good thing that we live in such times because in a situation like this a
nation can become strong and courageous. Soft living is not good for any
nation because it weakens the people. I wish to congratulate the people,
particularly the young men and women and the children, that they live in an
age full of tests and trials more difficult than the examinations they have to
take in schools and colleges. The tests in life are harder and bigger and no
book can help us in facing them. To face these tests and trials and to
emerge victorious, we need character, a stout heart and mind. As the years
roll by and free India grows up, we have to grow in strength along with it
and never permit ourselves to become complacent. We may have two,
three or even a thousand different views, but so far as the unity of India and
its security and prosperity are concerned, we have to speak with one voice.
There is no scope for difference of opinion in this matter. We can argue
about the approaches and methods, but whenever we take any action we
should ask ourselves whether by that step we are serving India,
strengthening its unity, helping in the defence of the country or weakening
it. This should be our yardstick in whatever we do because often we are
carried away in the heat of factional controversies and weaken the country.
We should remember all this because the days to come will not be easy
ones. However we look at the situation, we are going to face a difficult time.
      After the attack on our borders, we were compelled to take certain
measures which we did not like. The military expenditure had to be
increased, more than double, and for has to go on for ever. Recently, when
aggression was that taxes had to be levied and increased. Nobody likes
taxes, neither the taxpayer nor the government. But when the country is in
danger, those who are talking about their profits and not about the danger
hardly serve the country. Money we can earn and spend, but the country
committed, everywhere, whether in our Parliament or in the country at
large, we rose to the occasion and despite the hardships, we faced it with
firmness and dignity. No matter how much we have to suffer, even at the
cost of our lives, we have to face the danger of aggression so that India
may live.
      Now, we have to face all kinds of dangers, internal and external, and
in so doing if we have to carry heavier burdens we should be prepared to
do so. When nations go to war, the people have to carry tremendous
burdens and sometimes a country is laid waste. We are not facing such a
war at the moment. Nobody knows what the future holds for us. But to avert
such a war we have to be ever vigilant and we have to undergo hardships.
      We have a reputation for being a peace-loving people. The fact that
we are expanding our defence capacity and giving military training to our
young men does not mean that we have given up our principles and policy
of peace. We shall follow that policy in any situation and try to resolve
disputes with other countries by peaceful means, if it is possible to do so.
We do not like war which can bring ruin to the country and cause hardships
to the people. But there could be no peace without honour, certainly not by
submission to evil, out of fear. If the people are seized by fear, they weaken
the country and tarnish its fair name. Thus. while we prepare with all our
strength for the defence of the country, we shall tread the path of peace.
Whenever we can solve any problem in the world, any issue concerning us,
we shall always resort to a peaceful course, but not to the detriment of
India's honour. To uphold that honour we shall prepare in full measure. This
preparedness does not merely mean arms and armaments. It means that
every man, woman and child in the country has to offer something, has to
be ready to work with determination and in co-operation with others. Very
few people in our country know how to march in step. Marching in step is
not in itself a virtue but it stands for working together. An army is strong
because the soldiers work together, march in step. They are disciplined
and follow rules. We have to teach to our countrymen discipline, the
outlook of a soldier.
       It would be a good thing for our future if we prepare ourselves in this
manner and when we are out of the present danger, we would be a strong
country with courage and confidence in ourselves. Then we would be able
to march and the road to prosperity with ease. Nations become great by
self-confidence, not by relying on others. You can be friends with others,
but you have to rely on yourselves. There can be co-operation with others,
but you have to do your own thinking and work with your own hands. Any
country which forgets this and is frightened and loses self-confidence
begins to decline, faces ruin and lowers itself. What greater indignity can
there be for India than that fear should grip us and we lose confidence in
ourselves? Whatever work is there, it is we who have to do it, although we
have friends in the world and we have to maintain that friendship and take
their help. The big countries in the world have helped us and we are
grateful for that, not only for the help but for their sympathy. We have to
march ahead towards our goal on the path we have chosen for ourselves,
and we shall attain that goal. We have to remember this principle and
ensure the progress of the country. Relying on ourselves and with the help
of friends, we have to solve our economic problems, and so change our
country that it would be able to stand on its legs.
       I particularly want that the millions of our children have an opportunity
for growth, for education and to serve the country and to serve themselves.
Let us build an India in which these opportunities are available and there
are no differences of high and low. This is our vision of India. Of course, the
Planning Commission and other offices of Government are working for this
purpose, but as you know the Government and the Planning Commission
can only show the way. The work has to be done by millions of our people.
If they cannot do it, neither the Planning Commission nor the Government
can achieve anything. Whether it is defence or development, it is the
people who have to carry out the work, not those sitting in offices. Our task
is to awaken the 450 million people of India and to show the path. It is for
them to march along that road and reap the benefit. Whatever happened
on our border this year was, I think, all to the good because it will
strengthen and fortify us. It would prepare the country for progress,
provided we do not lose heart. Our people have never trodden the path of
cowardice.
      I again congratulate you on the 16th anniversary of our freedom and
hope that you will remember the day. Free India is still a child, for what are
sixteen years in the life of a country ? Of course, ours is an ancient country.
I hope it makes progress, becomes strong and holds its head high in the
world. Let us remember these things, particularly the fact that we are all
brethren in this country; wherever we live, and whatever our religion, we
have to work together. Whoever forgets this fact does not serve the country
well."

1961,Jawaharlal Nehru,INC,Independence Day Address,"Speech, 15 August 1961, in Delhi, at the Red Fort, NMML, AIR Tapes, TS No. 7146, NM No. 1460.","Selected works of Jawaharlal Nehru. Second Series. Vol 70, (1 July - 20 August 1961)",NA,"Sisters, brothers and children, it is the fourteenth anniversary of
independent India. I congratulate everyone on this auspicious day. On this
day ideas and memories come crowding into the mind. First of all, there is
the memory of Gandhiji who led us towards freedom. We must not only
think of him but of the lesson that he taught us and the path shown by him.
If we stay away from that path, we will come to grief as we have done in the
past. Let us think of him and the millions of martyrs who toiled for India's
freedom, bore untold hardships and in some instances, gave up their lives.
      Then we must look back over the fourteen years which have gone by
and take stock of our achievements and failures, our progress and the
things that need to be done. We must look to the past because we learn
from our experience. But ultimately our sight should be on the future
because it is the millions of Indians who are responsible for moulding that
future. It is not fate, for it is we ourselves who make or mar our fate by our
actions. Therefore, we must think of the future. The people of India have
come a long way and overcome great obstacles. But the future is full of
more obstacles and the goals that we have set our eyes on are far away.
Yet the years gone by give us confidence and strength for we have crossed
many milestones. Each of the Five Year Plans has been a great step and
now we are about to start the Third Plan. We hope that by the end of the
Third Plan India would have progressed a great deal and become stronger
and more prosperous. It is the foremost duty of every nation to protect its
freedom. Unfortunately danger threatens on our borders and so we must
be constantly vigilant.
       Only yesterday, a small incident occurred and a small piece of Indian
territory consisting of a few villages which had been separated from India
for a long time, have once again been merged into India. They are Dadra
and Nagar Haveli. It is a small piece of territory and yet the smallest piece
of India's territory is dear to our hearts and so we are extremely happy that
it has come back to us. It also reminded us of the other small pieces of
territory here and there which need to be merged into India once again.
      It is not our policy, and nor do we wish to launch an attack on any
other country or capture their territory. These are outdated notions. We
have no desire to attack anyone or to interfere in their affairs, nor will we
tolerate an attack on our country. Gone are the days of territorial conquest
and empire building. This is a new age in which territorial integrity and
sovereignty of nations is sacred. This is the age of cooperation between
nations. Those who violate these principles do not belong in this age.
        You must try to understand the age in which we are living today.
Aeroplanes have become very common today. Man is trying to reach the
Moon and the stars. At a time like this, how can we barricade ourselves
behind our narrow frontiers and indulge in petty squabbles? We are on the
threshold of a new frontier, a new age and must prepare ourselves to fit
into it. On the one hand many of our young men are already prepared and
are trying to participate in the task of building a new world. This is
something for us to be proud of. But on this day particularly, I do not wish to
boast about our achievements in the last fourteen years of which we can
justifiably be proud. It would be better to focus our attention on our
weaknesses.
      You may have read our Vice-President's message which has been
published in the newspapers. He has laid special emphasis on the need for
discipline. Our armed forces are extremely disciplined, courageous and
inspire confidence. But there must be discipline among the millions in the
country because we have to foster the fundamental unity of India which
creates an unbreakable bond in spite of the tremendous diversities of
language, province, religion, etc., and India's myriad forms. We must
remember that we are one large family and any man or woman who does
something which hurts that unity or weakens us does harm to India. We
must respect our neighbour and his religion and cooperate with everyone in
the country. The sad thing is that we often forget this lesson and fight
among ourselves in the name of religion, province, caste, language and
what not. There can be arguments and debates among the people. But
anything which creates disunity and bitterness and barriers is bad, for it
poses obstacles in the path we are trying to follow. You must remember
that we have taken up a gigantic task of uplifting crores of human beings,
which has perhaps no comparison anywhere in the world. We are trying to
go from one age into another, from the old rut and way of living and mire of
poverty into a new and prosperous age. Prosperity and progress bring
other things in their wake which uplift the mind and the spirit. Love of ease
and comfort can take a country nowhere.
       People in India have had to face tremendous hardships in the last
fourteen years. We have progressed and there has been some relief. There
are problems and they will continue to be there and in one sense, we are
lucky to have them because a nation which faces no problems and
difficulties becomes ease-loving and soft just as the children of rich parents
become useless and weak. We do not need such weak people. We want a
strong and spirited nation in which there is unity and a bond of affection. If
you look at the India of today, you will see a strange picture. Big things are
happening all over the country and India is holding her head high once
more. Millions of children go to schools and colleges and learn about the
new world. They are preparing themselves to serve India and the world in
the future. At the same time, there is bitterness and hatred, quarrels over
small things, etc.
       Our attention is focused at the moment on the Punjab where the
people are courageous and have served India well in the past and during
the freedom struggle and will undoubtedly do so in the future too. But
unfortunately along with their bravery and courage, which have made them
famous soldiers, there is great bitterness and internal feud among them in
which their energies are frittered away. Similar things are happening in
other parts of the country too. Therefore though one of our major problems
is to implement the Five Year Plan and march in step, the most urgent
problem confronting us today in India is to create unity, a spiritual bond, an
emotional integration among the people. Recently, we had a conference of
people from the different states to deliberate over this matter and certain
decisions were taken. But that was only a step. This is something which we
must give first priority. All our progress and industrialisation and prosperity
will be useless if we fight among ourselves and are unable to cooperate
with one another. This is of fundamental importance. Therefore I feel sad
when such incidents occur in the country and people are perturbed about
the trends in the Punjab, I hope that the people will be sensible and nothing
untoward will happen. The people of the Punjab are emotional and
hotheaded but ultimately capable of understanding. So they will
undoubtedly be sensible and soon the mental fog which envelops us and
prevents us from seeing clearly will be removed and fresh air and light will
prevail in which the present problem will be solved. No problem can be
solved by violence and fighting or hunger strike. These are not democratic
methods of solving problems, for they create barriers among the people
and social chaos will result. We must build a structure of society which is
purely Indian and not a Hindu society or a Muslim, Sikh or some other
communal society.
       Therefore our urgent priority is one of mutual cooperation. There are
many religions in the country, some of which came originally from outside.
But we must respect all of them for they belong to India and have done so
for thousands of years. India has been famous down the ages for her
religious tolerance and respect for other ways of life. Emperor Ashoka has
had this message engraved on stone more than two thousand years ago.
We have slid back from that and fight among ourselves in the name of
language, religion, caste and what not. The caste system cannot exist in a
democracy. We must get rid of it for it has divided our society in the past.
Everyone should be welcome to follow his own religion but that does not
mean that there should be religious feuds which weaken the country. We
must remember that the greatest dharma in India is unity, cooperation and
tolerance and anything which comes in the way of that is wrong, no matter
what name it goes by. Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Christians and people of all
other religions belong to India and enjoy equal rights. They must march
forward together. How is that to be achieved if we squabble among
ourselves?
     As I told you, this is the age when man looks to the Moon and the
stars and soon he will reach them. Those who risk their lives for the country
contribute to its greatness. A country cannot progress by sitting still. Money
is certainly important but it is human beings who make money and not the
other way round. We need human beings and humanism in the country.
       Secondly, you will notice that there are constant reverberations of war
drums in the world and preparations for war. More and more lethal
weapons are being discovered which can destroy the whole world once
they are unleashed. In spite of that, the elder statesmen of the world do not
have the wisdom to put an end to this mad race for armaments. It is quite
obvious that the modern lethal weapons cannot solve the problems of the
world—they can only bring destruction and ruin upon it. There is no
question of winning or losing in such a war, for the world will become one
large graveyard. Anyhow, we must first try to manage our own affairs. What
should be our course of action when the world faces such grave dangers?
It is obvious that we should continue to follow our own path and try to throw
our weight on the side of peace. But how can we hope to have an impact
unless we create an atmosphere of peace in our own country? We vitiate
the atmosphere by internal squabbles and disunity. How then can we serve
the world? Therefore, it is my request to you and through you, to the people
of India, that you should understand the age in which we live and the India
that we are trying to build. India is trying to cross new frontiers and old
weaknesses have no place in that. The important thing is the attitude of the
people of India and whether they are in a mental rut or get out of it and try
once again to climb new heights of humanism. This is the real problem
which confronts India today. The Five Year Plan and other projects are part
of this. You must try to understand what we have to do. Nobody can make
us do anything if we are engrossed in our petty squabbles or election fever
and what not. Elections come and go but a nation goes on and so do its
principles. If a nation fails to remain on the rails, winning elections can
solve nothing. What we face today is victory or defeat of an entire nation.
That is why I request all of you, the people of India and particularly the
people of the Punjab, Sikhs as well as the Hindus, to look at this question
from this angle and not in a narrow minded, emotional way. Please
remember that wrong means can make even the right goals wrong.
       Gandhiji taught us this lesson that wrong means do not lead to the
right goals. Therefore I hope that in this historic age of ours the history of
India and the world will be written by the actions and hard work of the
people as it was done during the freedom struggle. The historians will put it
down later. At a time like this, we cannot allow petty issues to lead us
astray and forget the larger, more important things. No problem can be
solved by bitterness or feuds. This is my request. Let the people of India
eschew this path and look to the new shining world before us and take the
country towards it.
       More than fifty years ago, your elders dreamt of India's freedom
which came true. It is seldom that one's dreams come true in one's own
lifetime. But in that one moment, we realized that we still had a long way to
go. We needed to foster unity in this great land of ours stretching from the
Himalayas to Kanyakumari, and to make her people broadminded and
large-hearted and prosperous once more. It is no small task to try to uplift
forty-three crores of human beings and to get rid of the weaknesses and
barriers of the past. We want everyone to have equal opportunities. So long
as we cherish all our religions, we will progress but communalism is bad
because it creates disunity. We must get rid of anything which keeps us
apart. I would like to tell you that one good yardstick for measuring any
action of ours is to see whether it binds us together or keeps us asunder.
Children and grown-ups must understand that the most urgent priority
before us today is discipline of the minds and hearts, and anything that
militates against it, no matter what garb it dons, is wrong. Please remember
that.
      There are innumerable children sitting here. They are the future of
India for whom we are working today. We have to build a beautiful new
world for them and instil into them a sense of India's past greatness and
also the need to grasp the new scientific and technological advance which
occurred in the world. We must get rid of the weaknesses which create
barriers among us and live as one great family.
      I give you my greetings on this auspicious, fourteenth anniversary of
India's independence. I would like to draw your attention to the fact that our
President has not been very well for the last few days and all of us hope
that he will become well soon and continue to serve the country as he has
done throughout his life. Jai Hind! Please say Jai Hind with me thrice.
      Jai Hind! Jai Hind! Jai Hind!"
1960,Jawaharlal Nehru,INC,In New Delhi: Independence Day Speech,"Speech at the Red Fort, 15 August 1960. AIR Tapes, NMML.","Selected works of Jawaharlal Nehru. Second Series. Vol 62, (1 August - 31 August 1960)",NA,"Sisters, Brothers, Compatriots, yesterday you celebrated
Janmashtami. Today we are gathered here to celebrate the anniversary of
India's freedom. Thirteen years ago, this beloved flag of ours fluttered from
the ramparts of the Red Fort for the first time, heralding to the world the
birth of a new nation, of a new star in the firmament. We had celebrated the
occasion with great pomp and show, but in reality it was a day not so much
of rejoicing as of recalling old memories and a renewal of the pledges taken
and promises made in the past. Many of those pledges had been fulfilled
but many more remained, and we were confronted with new problems and
challenges. Therefore it was essential to march forward once again with
heads held high and a heart full of determination. We had reached one
destination. But our voyage was by no means over, and we went on, facing
all kinds of ups and downs, stumbling occasionally, falling, but gaining
strength once again from the memory of our beloved leader, Gandhiji and
the principles that he had taught us.
       So, we are gathered here today, not to witness some spectacle but to
recall the past, and to look to the future. We are here to reaffirm the old
pledges. It is true that we got freedom through incessant toil, sacrifice and
tears. But if you think that our work is over with the coming of freedom, you
are mistaken. The fight for freedom is never ending. We have to toil
incessantly and make sacrifices to hold on to it. The moment a nation
begins to relax, or becomes complacent or weak and fritters away its
energies in petty quarrels, its freedom begins to slip away. So as I told you
just now, today is not a day of some grand spectacle. It is a day to reaffirm
and renew our old pledges and promises, and to examine our hearts a little
to see whether we have fulfilled our duties or not. What is the first and
foremost duty before a nation or a people? Its first duty is to maintain its
freedom, because if you give it a second place, everything else slips away
too. Therefore everything must be measured by this yardstick. Anything we
do must be judged from the point of view of whether it helps us to maintain
our freedom and unity and contributes to the country's progress or not. If
any of us forgets this and gives greater importance to one's province or
community, caste or language, we will be ruined and take the country with
us on the path of ruin. All these things are good in their own place, the city,
street, province, family, etc. But if we attach greater importance to any of
them and place them above the country, we will undoubtedly fall. I am
reminding you of this because the time has come to do so, and we often
tend to forget these things. We tend to forget the hard work, sacrifice and
toil of fifty years, during which we or rather the people of India, under
Gandhiji's leadership, moulded the country into a strong nation and welded
it into a peaceful weapon to win freedom. Freedom was a certainty once
the country became strong and united and developed the capacity to work
hard, because please remember that the enemy is within us. Nothing can
harm us if our hearts are in the right place and we are capable of working in
mutual cooperation and without fear. India has never had to fear anyone
from outside. She has had to fear the internal weakness and disunity and
the fissiparous tendencies, which have broken the country into a thousand
little fragments in the past. We were conquered again and again by outside
forces, not because they were stronger but because of our own weakness
and stupidity. This weakness and stupidity rear their heads now and again
when people quarrel among themselves in the name of language or
something else, forgetting that the thing that matters is the unity of the
country. The moment we forget it, we cause great harm to the country, no
matter what we may profess. This is something that should be borne in
mind and not merely that, but I would say that the time has come for every
Indian to search his heart to find out if his loyalties are towards the country
or some narrow parochial interest. The answer has to be found by every
single man, woman and child. The time has now come where there is no
longer any room for a mistake or misconception. If we indulge in petty
squabbles and internal wranglings, without realising what is happening in
the world today, the new lethal weapons that are being invented, the
danger that threaten our borders and the fact that the world is divided into
two armed camps, nobody knows when disaster may strike, we will invite
certain ruin.
       What will be the verdict of history if we forget our unity? The verdict
will be that there came a great leader - Mahatma Gandhi to India, who
taught the downtrodden, hungry and naked population of the country the
lessons of freedom, unity and the need to break down the barriers between
human beings. He worked for the uplift of the downtrodden Harijans and
taught the people the lesson of equality, irrespective of caste and religion.
Then freedom came. Was it meant only for a handful of people? Was it for
a Jawaharlal, who has been made the Prime Minister? Jawaharlal may
come and go, and so will others, but India will remain forever. Therefore,
every single human being in India, man and woman, child, is the heir to
India's freedom and must enjoy the full benefits of that freedom. It is
towards this that we continue to toil ceaselessly and do planning and what
not. We want every one of India's forty crores of people to get an equal
share in the country's freedom and so we have adopted a socialistic pattern
of society as our goal.
        It is a difficult task and cannot be done immediately. There are
thousands of pitfalls, difficulties and problems in the way. You cannot
change a human being or a nation of forty crores overnight. But ultimately
the kind of society that we want will emerge if we keep our eyes constantly
on our goal, on socialistic principles and equality of rights and opportunities
to all, whether they live in towns or villages. We need to work hard to
increase the wealth the country and then ensure the equitable distribution
of that wealth, so that it does not remain in a few pockets. There is no
magic in this that we can get it by counting beads. We will have to work
hard and achieve our goal by blood, sweat and toil.
      The historians will record that there came a time when the whole of
India woke up to life suddenly and became vibrant from the Himalayas to
Kanyakumari, began to hold their heads high and shed the burden of
hundreds of years of bondage. They marched fearlessly under the
leadership of their beloved Gandhiji towards freedom. After hundreds of
years, India shone once again and the world heard her voice, which had a
profound impact, because it was the true inner voice of the nation. India
began to be respected once again. But very soon, the same people of India
who had shown such great courage seemed to revert to their old
weaknesses and began to fight among themselves in the name of religion
or caste, language and province. The world began to wonder if it had made
a mistake in judging this nation.
       Today is a day of remembrance, of recalling the past, of introspection
and renewing our pledges. If some people refuse to celebrate this day
because they are grieved about something, they may be justified. But it
shows that they are forgetting the larger issues in denying the importance
of this day and are forgetting what India stands for. Everything else in the
world loses its importance; language, province, personal grief and
happiness, before it. This is how we must look at these things.
       You must be aware of the great tragedy that has befallen Assam and
Bengal. Two of our great provinces are facing great problems. We will
certainly solve them. There is no doubt about it. But what I cannot tolerate
is that the people, in their bitterness and fear, do not allow things to cool
down. There is constant criticism. Please remember that of all the
weaknesses in the world, fear is the worst. There is nothing worse than
fear, because all other weaknesses and evils in this world spring from it.
Once an individual or a nation gives in to fear, gradually all other evils will
overtake them. Telling lies, deceit, are all the offspring of fear. India
became strong because Gandhiji rooted out fear from our hearts. He taught
us to be fearless in the face of great imperial might, and the lesson of unity.
Why is it then that the people of Assam and Bengal, who have always lived
there, should suddenly be afraid of one another? Why is it that they are
forgetting India, which is larger than both Bengal and Assam and those
who do so, can serve neither Bengal nor Assam? Those who can forget,
even on this day, where their loyalty lies and what their duty is, are being
traitors to their country. All of you must understand this and determine
firmly to get rid of such weaknesses from the country.
      Take the Punjab, which lies close to Delhi. A few days ago a strange
uproar took place there, in the name of language and province, etc. This is
not the occasion to go into the merits of the case. But I know that the
events that took place in the Punjab, and the way things were done were
absolutely wrong, bad and completely against the spirit of India's freedom.
Punjabi is a grand tongue, a strong and powerful language, and I feel that
every Punjabi has the right and a duty to learn it. If he fails to do so, he will
lose a great heritage of his. It is part of the national heritage. I cannot
understand why there should be any arguments about Hindi, Punjabi,
Bengali or Assamese. All of them are valuable treasures and part of India's
culture. It is only small, narrow-minded, illiterate, useless minds that set up
one language against the other. Sensible human beings learn as many as
they can.
      Where are we going? What are these pettiness and misconceptions
we are falling into? India is a great country with a long and glorious past
and a history going back thousands of years. There is good as well as bad
in our country. A new era has started in the history of India and the people
are once again strong and vibrant as a nation. How can we serve the
country by indulging once again in petty feuds and by fighting in the name
of caste, language, religion and province? Language and religion are things
which uplift a human being. How can we use them to inflict such deep
wounds on our body politic? Please think about all this.
      India has become free and we have no desire to commit aggression
against any other country. Those days are gone. But at the same time, we
shall not tolerate any enemy to come into our country. There has to be
certain reciprocity in these things, of mutual respect between nations. If any
country behaves in a way injurious to our dignity, we will combat it in every
possible way. If danger threatens our borders, we will face it. We do not
want even an inch of anyone's territory, nor do we wish to interfere in the
rights of others, because our principle is that the freedom and territorial
integrity of all nations is inviolate. It is our principle that every single village
should have autonomy and govern itself through its panchayat.
       There is one small gap in India's freedom. People may think that we
do not remember. But it is something that always rankles in our minds and
will continue to do so until a small part of India, called Goa, becomes free.
Let the world not forget that this is always in the minds and hearts, and it is
only by great willpower and courage, not weakness, that we have
prevented ourselves from solving the problem by armed intervention. But
India cannot forget Goa and the problem will be solved. I want the world to
take note of this, as also the power which has Goa in its clutches. Let there
be no mistake about this.
        I would like you to look at the world of today. Just when we were
hoping that the atmosphere was improving, things have taken a turn for the
worse and once again there is poison and bitterness among the nations.
The big powers are once again indulging in sabre-rattling. All sorts of lethal,
terrible weapons have been invented. In such a dangerous, terrible world,
those who make the slightest error of judgement or become disunited are
bound to fall and become weak. We must remember this, especially on this
day and pay homage to the memory of that great man, Gandhiji, who has
contributed the most to making India strong and united and led her to
freedom. It is not enough to pay homage. We must remember and act upon
his principles. India is no small country which can veer this way or that. The
only two courses open are India's destiny and either to hold our heads high
and march forward in the world, or downfall, if we are weak. There can be
no middling status for us. It is obvious that we cannot allow our country to
fall, for gone are those days. We simply cannot tolerate it. Therefore the
only course open to us is to hold our heads high and march in step, in unity
and cooperation. There is no other alternative before us and if anything
comes in the way of this, it will have to be removed because we cannot
allow petty things to stand in the way of India's destiny.
       However, this is not in my hands. You have made me the Prime
Minister for a few days, so I am here. There are innumerable defects in me.
The real strength of India lies in her people, in you, and you, and the
millions of others who live in India. It is you who must understand what
India's destiny is, especially on this day, and decide where your duty lies.
How are we to utilize this invaluable freedom of ours to uplift India's
millions? How are we to prevent freedom from slipping away due to our
weakness? What I am saying is not limited to a handful of officials or
ministers or even prime ministers. This is up to the millions of people in
India, in every single village and town in the country. We want panchayati
raj in the country. Every single panch and sarpanch must be strong and
independent and capable of protecting the interests of his village. This has
to be done all over the country. I want to remind you of this because it is
your duty towards the country. We have served the nation for a few years
and sometimes made mistakes, but we did our best with honesty and
integrity. But the tasks that we have taken up cannot be completed by the
list of men without the help of the people. Take the five year plans, for
instance. It is not something which has been laid down. It is the picture of
the future of India, which can be realized only by hard work and by bearing
tremendous hardships. India will then undoubtedly progress, but your
understanding and effort are absolutely essential. At a time like this, how
can we not indict those who foment trouble and incite the people, as
wrongdoers and the guilty party? Please think about it.
      Finally, I shall once again repeat what the foremost duty of every
Indian is. His first and foremost duty is to maintain and strengthen India's
freedom and her unity. This is the lesson that we have to learn on this day.
My greetings to all of you on the anniversary of India's freedom and
congratulations for this day, thirteen years ago, when the flag of freedom
was unfurled for the first time. I hope there will be hundreds and thousands
of such anniversaries. Jai Hind.
      Please say Jai Hind with me thrice before we sing the national
anthem. Jai Hind! Jai Hind! Jai Hind! Say it aloud Jai Hind! Jai Hind! Jai
Hind! Jai Hind! Jai Hind! Jai Hind!"
1959,Jawaharlal Nehru,INC,Striving for Progress,"Independence day speech at the Red Fort, New Delhi. 15 August 1959. AIR Tapes, NMML.","Selected works of Jawaharlal Nehru. Second Series. Vol 51, (1 - 31 August 1959)",http://nehruportal.nic.in/selected-works-jawahar-lal-nehru-second-series-51#page/26/mode/2up,"Sisters, brothers and comrades, today we are assembled here once
again to celebrate the anniversary of independent India. On this day, we
look back a little at our achievements in the past and to the future as well
on this day. Twelve years is a very short period in India's history of
thousands of years. The soil and stones of Delhi have seen thousands of
years go by as well as the last twelve years when the people of India have
been trying to take their country out of the old rut of poverty and the
hardships that afflicted it. This is a far more difficult task than even the
struggle for freedom because it involves getting rid of our weaknesses and
the burdens of the past under which we have been groaning for centuries.
What we have been able to achieve in the last twelve years is there for
everyone to see. A number of good things have happened and some bad
too. Many things have happened which I think will find a place in the history
of India in the future. At the same time, other things have happened which
have weakened us and exposed our shortcomings.
      So all of us are assembled here near the Red Fort and the tri-colour
has been unfurled once again. What are the thoughts in your minds about
the future? We have had to face innumerable difficulties in the last twelve
years both internal and external. There have been great national disasters,
floods and droughts and failure of crops, etc., and our weaknesses have
dogged our footsteps relentlessly. Many people in the country have gone
astray in their greed and forgotten the interests of the nation in their own
narrow selfish interests, forgotten the great tasks that we are engaged in to
build a great nation once again and caused great harm to their country in
the hope of some immediate benefit to themselves. Even today you are
facing great difficulties, inflation and other things and to some extent, we
are helpless and unable to bring the matter fully under control. It is partly a
result of man's narrow self-interest. Well, whatever it is, it will have to be
faced. On this day especially we must remember what we are and what we
wish to become and where we are going. We must refresh our memories
once again about the events of twelve years ago when our beloved leader
Mahatma Gandhi was still with us and we looked to him for guidance. We
had been looking to him for guidance for years and years and tried to follow
the path shown by him and achieved success by doing so. How much do
we remember of those days? We cannot afford to forget at any time that
the most important task before us is to establish unity in the country
because if we break up into separate parts, whether on the basis of
language, province, religion or caste, we will lose all our strength and fall.
We cannot progress and instead of a bright and shining future, India's
history will be one of small communities fighting among themselves.
        Therefore the first thing to remember is unity. We must break down
the innumerable barriers, old and new, among us and always put the
country first before a part of it, no matter how good that part may be. If a
part of India has any greatness, it lies in the fact that it is part of India.
Without that, the various parts of the country will have no greatness or
importance. So we must remember this because we have become so used
to living in small little compartments in the past due to the caste system that
the habit has not gone fully yet. We must get rid of it and conquer it.
       Secondly, what are our goals for the future? There are social and
economic goals before us and we wish to remove poverty from India. All
this is true. But what is the yard-stick for measuring these things? One
yard-stick shown by Mahatma Gandhi was to see how far the common man
in India benefitted. We do not have to bother about the handful of rich men
for they can look after themselves. It is the common people who are often
silent about their hardships especially the people who live in the rural
areas, who need to be looked after. Please remember that though Delhi is
a very special city of India and the world, and all of us who are the citizens
of Delhi are extremely fortunate in a sense, Delhi is not India. India consists
of millions of villages and until they progress, India cannot progress even if
the cities of Delhi, Bombay, Calcutta or Madras advance. Therefore we
must always keep the picture of India's villages in mind and devise ways
and means for their progress. We can all help but ultimately they will
progress only by their own effort, daring and self-reliance. The biggest
disaster that has occurred in the country today is that our people are
forgetting how to be self-reliant and expect others to do their work for them.
Our villagers are strong people, good people. But they have got into the
habit of looking to government officials to do things for them, instead of
standing on their own feet. The plans are aimed at making them self-reliant.
If the community projects and national extension schemes work well, it will
be a revolutionary thing for India and the world for it will be a reawakening
of five and a half lakh villages of India. If the government officials run these
things it will be no revolution it will be an ordinary, lifeless affair. Life has to
flow from within a nation and cannot be put into it artificially.
       Therefore it has become a big challenge to this country to the people
living in cities as well as villages, to learn to stand on their own feet and
work in mutual cooperation. The government must certainly help in every
way. But a nation cannot progress by the efforts of government servants
alone. It has to learn to stand on its own feet. This is true specially of the
villages. Therefore we have decided that there should be cooperative
societies to make the people strong and teach them to work together and
trust one another that does not mean that the government should interfere
constantly. I want that government interference should be as little as
possible and the people must learn to hold the reins of government in their
own hands. The fundamental policies may be decided by the government.
       Now another thing to be kept in mind is the yard stick that is to be
used to measure India's progress. The only yard-stick is the progress of the
forty crores of Indians. How does a nation progress? It can be only through
its own effort. How can you make a poor country prosperous? Again, it can
be done only through the effort of the people. No nation can progress by
depending on the charity of others. So we can progress only by our own
effort and by increasing the production of wealth in the country. How have
the countries in the West advanced? Whether it is Europe or the United
States, they have become wealthy by their own effort. Behind the wealth
and progress of each one of them lies tremendous hard work and unity. No
nation can progress without these two things.
      The habit of working hard has not developed in our country. It is not
our fault. We have got into such habits due to circumstances. But it is a fact
that we cannot work as hard as people in Europe, Japan, China, the Soviet
Union or the United States. Please do not think that those nations have
become prosperous by magic. It is only by their hard work and intelligence
that they have advanced so far. So we can also progress by working hard
and using our intelligence. There is no other way. We cannot progress by
magic. The whole world moves by the effort of human beings. The wealth
of the entire world is produced by the hard work of human beings, whether
they work on land or industries or shops or at some handicrafts. A handful
of officers sitting in their offices do not produce any wealth. It is the farmer
or the artisan who produces wealth by his work.
      I was happy to see that recently the Punjab Government have
increased their working hours. The wealth of the Punjab will definitely
increase and the people will benefit. There are so many holidays in this
country that nobody can compete with us in this matter. Holidays are good
things and refresh a man. But too many holidays are not good because the
people get out of the habit of working.
       So, as you know, we are on the threshold of the Third Five Year Plan.
Two Plans are over and we have benefitted greatly from them. The more
we have progressed, our problems have increased proportionately. We are
hemmed in by problems from all sides and sometimes the burden has
seemed great. But we have progressed and all these problems are a sign
of that progress. Those who do not move need face no problems nor find
any answers. Even today when we are surrounded by problems and
difficulties, they are the problems of a growing nation, a nation which is
progressing from very strong foundations. Huge steel plants and other
projects are coming up. What do they stand for? They are not merely
industries but a symbol of the new life that they will provide in various
corners of India. The big industries that are coming up will form the
foundation of our progress. They will provide employment to millions of
people who will produce new wealth. So in this way, the Five Year Plans
are not merely putting up plants and industries but are building the edifice
of an independent and prosperous India. It is essential to lay the
foundations well. We cannot see the foundations though the two Five Year
Plans have done so. Now we are on the threshold of the Third Plan for
which we are preparing from now. I want you to understand it because
even the Third Plan is not going to usher in an era of leisure and rest. We
will have to work hard to complete it. No nation can progress without
working hard and bearing some hardships. Those who do not learn to face
difficulties become slack and listless and the nation slows down.
      So there is a great challenge before us and the eyes of the world are
upon us. They want to see what a great country like India which has
produced even in these times a man like Mahatma Gandhi does now. It is
not only a question of putting up industries, increasing food production,
expanding community projects, etc. The main thing is how we go about
these things and whether it is with our heads held high or following the
wrong path. We must remember this because the most important lesson
that Gandhiji taught us was to hold our heads high, not to adopt wrong
means, not to tell lies and cause harm to the nation for selfish interests.
This was the basic lesson taught by him to everyone, adults and children,
and the moment we forget that lesson, we will fall.
      Therefore as we enter the thirteenth year, let us do so with heads
held high and march in step with the firm determination that we shall reach
our goal in time.
        Jai Hind. Please say Jai Hind with me thrice. Jai Hind, Jai Hind, Jai
Hind!"

Vol 43, (1 July - 31 August 1958)",http://nehruportal.nic.in/selected-works-jawaharlal-nehru-second-series-volume-43#page/82/mode/2up,"Sisters, brothers, children and fellow countrymen, today is the
eleventh anniversary of our Independence and we are assembled here to
celebrate it. Greetings to all of you on this auspicious occasion. But are we
assembled here merely as a matter of routine or to witness a spectacle or
with some other motive? Eleven years ago, when our National Flag was
unfurled for the first time from the ramparts of the Red Fort, it was a
red-letter day in the history of India and the world. It was a special day not
only because India became free on that day but because the manner in
which she won that freedom, with honour and peace, was unique, it set an
example for the world. We held our heads high once more and respect for
us grew in the world.
      Eleven years have passed since then and this period has been full of
tension and problems for us. Our hearts were full of joy on the day we
unfurled the flag of freedom eleven years ago, joy at the thought of having
reached our goal. But even before the first flush of joy had subsided,
another kind of news began to reach us. We were full of pride that we had
won freedom honourably peacefully and non-violently, but then reports
reached us of the terrible carnage that presented a completely different
picture before us. The communal riots spread to Delhi and elsewhere and
we saw how close we were to defeat at the very moment of victory. At
daybreak we were celebrating our victory and sunset we had a glimpse of
defeat too. We had not lost the battle to an enemy; we had won it. The
defeat lay in our weakness and folly, which are most dangerous. We faced
the enemy boldly, tigerlike but a poisonous snake came from behind and bit
us. Therefore, I would like to warn you that once again such poisonous
snakes are rearing their heads and they can bite us, weaken us, lead to our
downfall and destroy everything that we have built up patiently over the
years.
      We are assembled here today to celebrate this day and also to look
back a little on the past. There is pressure of the present-day problems and
also a glimpse of the future. We have embarked on a great journey. The
journey towards freedom was over after a long and arduous march and
now an even more difficult journey lies ahead in which 36, 37 crores of
Indians must march together. We are marching holding each others' hands
toward prosperity and trying to alleviate the sufferings of the people and to
ensure that the primary necessities of life are available to them. We are
toiling so that the shadow of bondage may never fall on our pretty little
children. They were born in free India and they must always remain free
with heads held high and live in prosperity and always advance towards a
better future.
      We envisaged such a future and are marching towards it but there
are a thousand pitfalls and difficulties in the way. Sometimes, there are
floods or droughts or too much rain and yet the condition is much worse
when there are no rains. You know the tremendous difficulties we have had
to face in this country during the last few years. But we faced them with
courage and in spite of difficulties and problems. India has always held her
head high and never bowed down to adversity. This is a testing time for us,
and a far more difficult challenge than the freedom struggle. It is a testing
time for our ability to be united in adversity, our spirit of cooperation and the
determination to cross hurdles and reach the goals that we have set before
us. So, at a time like this, if there is disunity among us and people squabble
with each other and become violent, what does it mean? Does it mean that
we have forgotten the lessons taught by Mahatma Gandhi? Have we
forgotten thousands of years of India's history? Are we not ignoring the
entire future of the younger generation for whom we are toiling today?
What do we think when we indulge in petty squabbles and raise our hands
in hatred against our fellow men merely to gain some political ends? I do
not know why we behave like this.
       I stand before you as you are gathered here to celebrate this day.
There is joy in my heart but there is also grief that even 11 years after
Independence incidents of rioting and violence are taking place in some
parts of the country and that too on this day. We must remain vigilant and
see that people are not misled. I am standing here not to criticise anyone. It
is not my job. Nor am I standing here as a representative of any group or
any party. I am standing here as a traveller, a fellow traveller travelling with
millions of people living in this country I appeal to you to peep into your
hearts, your real feelings and think about what is your duty at the moment
and also tell others what is expected of them. It is obvious that, whatever
be our policy, we can succeed only if we work peacefully and without any
disturbance. This is a well-known fact. Otherwise our energy will be frittered
away in useless wrangling with each other. We must talk to one another if
there is a difference of opinion. There is no other alternative in this country.
       We loudly advise the world and talk self-righteously. We have raised
aloft the banner of Panchsheel and people's attention has been drawn to it.
It has had an impact on other countries. But when our behaviour within the
country is contrary to what we preach and is exposed to the whole world to
see, we cannot but bow our heads in shame. How can we presume to give
advice to others when we cannot control ourselves? Therefore, my appeal
to you and everyone in the country is that, while we should certainly think of
other problems and no matter what policy we follow, we must not forget
that it is of fundamental importance to maintain equanimity and eschew
violence and realise that if we continue to indulge in internal squabbles and
petty feuds, there can be neither freedom nor socialism nor democracy. No
matter what your views are, if you try to settle your differences by threats of
violence, you will achieve nothing. This is the situation also in the world
today when the Great Powers are sitting on big arsenals and hold atom
bombs. Each one of these powers has the strength to destroy the world but
no power has the means of stabilising the situation through war. The only
hope for the world lies in maintaining peace.
      Gradually, it is beginning to dawn upon the world that war spells ruin,
and yet preparations for war are going on all the time and everyone lives in
fear. As you know, recently a dangerous situation arose in the countries of
West Asia. Even now military forces are arrayed in that region, in constant
readiness to fight. It is hoped that there will be no war and the mutual fear
and tension will subside and that the problem will be solved soon and our
friends will be able to live in complete peace. The Arab countries have
fought for several years for freedom and are succeeding slowly. We hope
that there will be no threat to their liberty and that they will be able to enjoy
the right of self-determination and will live in friendship and amity with one
another.
       This is the situation in the world today. Please remember that India is
held in great respect in the world and its opinion carries weight. It is
regarded as a sensible nation which does not get carried away easily or lift
a hand in anger against anyone. This is how the world sees us. How far
this is right or wrong is left to you to decide, for it is both right and wrong to
some extent. It is right in so far as it was proved by our non-violence and
self-restraint during the lifetime of Mahatma Gandhi. But now our own
actions prove it wrong. So I appeal to you to think about these matters.
Look at what is happening in the cities of Gujarat, which is the State of
Gandhiji's birth and where he taught his lessons assiduously to the
hard-working people who have made tremendous sacrifices and are
counted among the most enlightened people in India. In Gujarat today
there is a strange atmosphere of madness. People are defaming
themselves and the country. Gujarat is a good State. We must remain
vigilant and think where such madness will lead us. It has no connection
with any policy or decision. In an independent country everyone has the
right to have his own views and express them before others. But nobody
has the right to coerce anyone at the point of a gun or a lathi to change his
view. Such behaviour will only spell ruin and lead to unnecessary conflicts.
Have we toiled for so long for India's freedom only to fall into this abysmal
pit of internal weakness? You should think about this.
       The youth in India have a bright future before them. It is in their hands
that the future responsibility of India lies and so they must prepare
themselves for it wherever they may be, in schools or colleges or
elsewhere. But many of them get carried away and forget the main issues
due to their petty preoccupations and wranglings. They make themselves
useless in the process and do not serve the country in any way. So we
must think seriously about where we are heading. It is obvious that after
having reached where we are today, after facing thousands of difficulties
and problems, we are not going to yield before any threat or give up
because of any weakness. Our work will go on and we must move forward
with courage, no matter what obstacles come in our way. We must
overcome our weaknesses and keep moving with our heads held high.
       Eleven years have passed since Independence. It is a long time,
though not perhaps in the life of a nation. You know what was India's
condition was 11 years ago or even earlier and compare it with India's
position in the world today or even at home. All of us have thousands of
grievances, many of which are genuine and some are not genuine.
However, we have had to face several disasters, like floods, drought and
crop failures and as a consequence, rise in prices. People are facing great
difficulties and their complaints are justified. I do not deny this. Traders and
businessmen, instead of helping the nation in the time of crisis, are
resorting to black marketeering and other wrong activities. Your complaints
are fully justified because such activities are harmful to the nation, are
unpatriotic. People who indulge in unlawful activities should realise the
consequences of their actions.
       Well, we are facing problems of great magnitude in India and the
world. We are part of the world and so we have to participate in its affairs.
But our real problems are within the country. Whether we live in
Kanyakumari or Rameshwaram in the South or in Kashmir in the North or
in the East or in the West, we are one nation and we will not allow anyone
to break it up. You and I and all of us are citizens of India and not merely
residents of our own narrow streets or cities or States, and do not belong
only to the North, South, East or West. This must be understood quite
clearly because those who are against this and weaken India's unity will
have to contend with us. We must fight against these tendencies whether
they arise in the country or outside. India's unity and freedom are most
important without which there can be no firm basis for India's prosperity. I
agree that we have made mistakes and slipped up many times, as nobody
is infallible. But what we need is to keep the fire of determination and zeal
burning in our hearts and minds, which will lead us towards our goal. If we
stumble and fall, we must have the strength and ability to stand up
immediately and march on.
       Some people seem to think that the days are gone when it was
necessary to show bravery and courage as we did when we were fighting
against the might of imperialism. Let no one be under any illusion about
this. India has tremendous life in her, more than earlier though sometimes
we commit mistakes and lose sight of larger issues in the heat of the
moment. Perhaps occasional jolts and shocks are good as they remind us
about what we are and where our duty lies and keep us on the right path.
      So, we are once again assembled at this historic Red Fort, which had
been a symbol of bondage for centuries and now is a symbol of our
freedom. We assemble here not merely as a matter of duty, but to remind
ourselves about the pledges and promises that we have made, and about
the path that we must follow to fulfil those pledges and promises. We
assemble here to remember our great leaders, especially Mahatma
Gandhi, who brought us here. Many of you who are young may not have
seen him and to you he is only a legend. In fact, the entire history of our
freedom struggle has become a legend and it will always be an
unforgettable legend. It is not a story but a lesson which we shall always
remember. We must remember that lesson today when we are deviating
from the right path. Let us pay homage to the memory of Mahatma Gandhi
who enabled this country to rise and attain freedom and who ultimately laid
down his life for the sake of the nation.
     Jai Hind! Please say Jai Hind with me thrice.
     Jai Hind! Jai Hind! Jai Hind!"
1957,Jawaharlal Nehru,INC,Economic Freedom is the Next Step,"Speech from the ramparts of the Red Fort after unfurling the National Flag on the Tenth Anniversary of Independence, Delhi, 15 August 1957. From The Hindu and The Hindustan Times, 16 August 1957.","Selected works of Jawaharlal Nehru. Second Series. Vol 39, (1 August - 31 October 1957)",http://nehruportal.nic.in/selected-works-jawaharlal-nehru-second-series-volume-39#page/46/mode/2up,"Brothers, sisters and children, I am happy that this rain has come. It
might have worried some of you whose clothes are slightly drenched. But in
this rain I see a symbol of our country's prosperity, of its becoming green
and fertile and our hearts also being refreshed. Children, my greetings to
you on this auspicious day, it is you who will build the future of this country.
You have to prepare yourselves with firm determination and stout hearts to
embark on the journey of wiping out poverty from the country in the same
united way in which we wiped out slavery. We have completed one journey
of consolidating our freedom, the foundations of which were laid a hundred
years ago by our people with their blood sweat and tears. We have before
us now another journey of emancipating our people economically. But any
nation that undertakes the mighty task of wiping out unemployment and
poverty is bound to meet with reverses. We often stumbled and fell in our
struggle for freedom. We faced heartbreaking reverses, but we did not give
up. We again rose and marched on. In the same way today we have to
face the challenges of these economic and other difficulties in a united and
firm manner and rebuild a new India.
       How many among you here remember the face of India before
freedom? If you do not remember it, you cannot compare the conditions in
those days in the cities and villages with the present times? It was a
tremendous task, requiring hard work to change those conditions. It could
not be done by magic. It was hard and persistent work, which brought India
freedom. We require this capacity for hard work and unity to rebuild a new
India. Whenever a country wants to go forward rapidly, it has to face the
challenge of many odds. We have to understand that we may stumble and
fall. Only those people do not stumble, who are always sitting at ease or
just reclining. When people march forward, they are bound to stumble. We
have gone forward in this way:
                  Is tarah tave kee hain hamnain manzilen
                   Gir paray, gir kar uthay, uth kar chalev
(We have reached our goals in a manner where we stumbled fell down and
                      rose, and marched again.)
Many people when faced with difficulties tend to lose heart and turn their
backs and slink away. They are frightened by these difficulties which
appear to them like a big mountain. But big things are only achieved by
facing difficulties of every kind. One can see the progress India has
achieved by looking around at the conditions in the neighbouring countries.
We are not so much worried about the world as we are about our own duty
to our country. We have taken a big job on our hands. We are doing it. And
we will do it.
       On this historic day, memories of a hundred years of glorious struggle
and achievements beckon us to greater effort. The torch of freedom, lit by
the freedom fighters a hundred years ago like Tatya Tope, Nana Sahib,
Kunwar Singh, Liaquat Ali Khan and above all the Rani of Jhansi, was kept
aloft and burning by those who succeeded them. Dadabhai Naoroji,
Lokmanya Tilak and Mahatma Gandhi in their turn carried the torch and
faced the might of British Imperialism. We have today to remember the
lessons of unity, religious tolerance and fellow feeling taught by Mahatma
Gandhi and other great sons of India and go forward in a united and
determined manner.
       India is celebrating today the Tenth Anniversary of her Independence
and the First Centenary of the 1857 Struggle. Some historians have tried to
belittle the importance of the War of Independence of a hundred years ago.
But the basic fact is that the India of those times did rise gloriously against
the foreign yoke and a large majority of common people joined the struggle.
And people of all religions, Hindus, Muslims and others, together rose and
bore every suffering to attain freedom. There is no doubt that it was a War
of Independence in which the foundations of freedom were laid with the
blood of the people. The most lovable name of the freedom fighters of
those times is of Rani Lakshmi Bai of Jhansi. These names are in our
hearts and will remain in our hearts always. Their memory will remain fresh
for centuries.
     Now, our neighbour Pakistan is a part of our heart and body. How
can we ever think of fighting against Pakistan? This would only be
tantamount to harming ourselves. If Pakistan through its foolishness
entertained enmity towards us, it would be only harming itself. No doubt our
relationship with Pakistan is strange because even if there is bitterness
against each other, even if there is some anger, it is a very close
relationship of thousands of years which mere laws cannot obliterate. If
some harm comes to India, it is bound to harm Pakistan also. Similarly, if
Pakistan is harmed, it will affect India too.
       So, we want that we remain in peace and friendship with Pakistan
and our relations grow in such a manner that they remain happy in their
freedom and we remain happy in our freedom. This does not imply that
India can be cowed down by threats and made to abandon her rights. It will
be neither doing justice to ourselves, nor to Pakistan nor to others. It would
not be a good example too. So, we will remain firm on our rights and
defend them with all our strength and with cool minds and go forward. We
will be friends of all.
      Coming to the international situation, India does not like the cold war
which is raging in the world. We think this cold war engenders jealousy in
the heart. It is a wrong thing. It makes the heart narrow. No country can
grow in this manner. India's hand of friendship is stretched out towards all
countries. We want to shake hands with all countries.
      But in the ultimate analysis, India's position in the world will depend
on her own internal achievements. If India is respected today in the world, it
is because of our achievements during the last ten years. The world has
taken note of a strong nation having entered the world arena, a nation
which is making progress rapidly. So, it is only after seeing our ten years'
work, that the world has begun to respect us.
       There may be passing difficulties but they have to be overcome with
determined effort. We will overcome them and step by step our nation will
go forward. There will be more work and we will be able to eliminate
unemployment and especially the suffering of our people, living in villages
or cities today, who for centuries have borne the burdens of poverty. We
have completed one journey of freedom. The second journey has just
begun. It is before us. We will reach its end also by remaining united.
       We have gathered here in hundreds and thousands to celebrate this
day. This day is the Tenth Anniversary of our Free India and the Centenary
of the big War of Independence, which took place here a hundred years
ago. You are here in your big numbers, but more than that, other people
were gathered here too. The memories of those caravans which came
here, caravans of people who showed courage, served India, served our
nation, and went away after doing their duty. They may be here or they
may be in our minds or they may be seeing what India's position today is
after a hundred years. It is ultimately the efforts made by these people
through their blood, sweat and tears, who gave their lives for the country,
that have brought the results which we see today. It is this story of ups and
downs of a hundred years that we see today in this city of Delhi and
especially in this Red Fort, whose every stone relates this story.
        Before me is Chandni Chowk, the famous bazar of Delhi for
centuries. This Chandni Chowk has seen mighty processions of kings and
emperors, it has seen the country taking a turn in its history, it has seen the
fall of a mighty empire and the birth of a new State. Here processions went
by of old India, of Moghul emperors, of British rulers, on big elephants.
Those times came and went and now Free India's time has come. We are
today seeing the truths of a hundred years of struggle. We have now to see
that we preserve the fruits of this struggle.
      In these ten years the face of India has changed to some extent and
our voice has reached the ears of other people in the world. This is a voice
which is a little different from the voices they have been hearing. We did
not growl, we did not shout because we learnt our lessons under the
leadership of Mahatma Gandhi, who worked silently. But behind this silent
work of ours there is determination and strength. India entered the world
arena as one of the wrestlers. But it is not to fight anyone, but to serve
ourselves and to some extent serve the world also. During the last ten
years, the path has been cleared to some extent for the people of India to
go forward. Many thorns in this path have been cleared and brushed aside.
But still some more thorns remain. In the political field, the path has been
very much cleared. India has now to clear the economic path and go
forward.
       Now, the world is facing a strange situation. The atomic and
hydrogen bombs are hanging on the head of the world menacingly and no
one knows when they explode. Yet, this same atomic power can be used
for the good of humanity.
       India today is facing many problems. The one relating to foodgrains is
especially important. The prices of foodgrains are rising, affecting
everyone, But the burden on those whose income is low is more than on
others. That is a matter which certainly cause worry. But it is a worldwide
phenomenon, India, however, will get over that and other problems. The
trouble is that big projects like steel plants and river valley schemes take
some time to complete. The results that flowed from them will come only
after some time. But all those are definite signs of the people going
forward. The whole of India today is like a big workshop where the kisan,
the mill worker and the engineer or anybody else are immersed in their
daily tasks. The day is coming nearer when the entire nation will reap the
fruits of these big projects. We must remember that we have to stand on
our own legs. Nobody will come from outside to take us forward. We have
to depend on our own efforts. India is both an old country and a new one. It
has its past of 5,000 years. Yet, it is a young country which is only ten
years old. We have to see where we are going today. Our War of
Independence was started 100 years ago with blood. It was suppressed.
Even though it was put down for the time being, the battle was not over. It
was continued by others in later years who consolidated the unity of the
people, and brought them together.
       The Buddha Jayanti celebrations took place last year and the 2,500th
birth anniversary of the great son of India had refreshed the minds of the
people and the impact that his teachings made on vast masses of humanity
is tremendous. It is that message of peace and love taught by the Buddha
and Mahatma Gandhi that has given strength and unity to the people of
India. We can go forward only when we continue to follow these principles
and work in a cooperative and united manner. Jai Hind!"
1956,Jawaharlal Nehru,INC,Renewing the Pledge,"Independence day speech from the Red Fort, New Delhi. 15 August 1956. AIR Tapes, NMML. Original in Hindi.","Selected works of Jawaharlal Nehru. Second Series. Vol 34, (21 June - 31 August 1956)",http://nehruportal.nic.in/selected-works-jawahar-lal-nehru-second-series-34#page/1/mode/1up,"Jai Hind. Greetings to all of you on the ninth anniversary of Indian
independence. The new star of independent India blazed out in the
firmament nine years ago. India was new and yet very old too, at the same
time, a country moulded by centuries of experience and by the sacrifice,
hard work, blood, sweat and tears of its people. India donned a new garb in
the time of Mahatma Gandhi, she acquired a new glitter and a new manner.
You will remember how we fought for freedom during the last two
generations. We struggled, millions of us, with courage and bravery. We
struggled gloriously, in a civilized manner, without lifting a finger against
anyone. We fought with the enemy but made a friend of him. It was a
unique method that we adopted. Rather Gandhiji did, and we followed him
as best as we could. That is how the millions of human beings in this
country of ours have been moulded. This is how we became independent.
      The independence of India has had an impact on other nations also.
Not because we are a vast country in size with some 35-37 crore living
here. But because the world saw a unique method unfolding before them,
an entirely novel method of fighting a war in a civilized manner. I want to
remind you that the real greatness of India lies in this and it has had a great
impact on the world. We acquired a new pride in ourselves and were
emboldened to play a role on the world stage. We had a hand in solving
some big international problems. At the moment when war drums can be
heard in the distance and the world is preparing for war, all eyes are drawn
towards India. Not because we have big armies or that we use threats to
achieve our ends but because we have learnt to serve and make friends
with others. It is because we have helped to bring about peace in war-torn
areas, and to unravel knotty problems, that India has become famous in the
world. There are grave dangers facing the world today. Therefore we must
refresh our memories about the lessons learnt long ago and try to serve the
world.
      You must have heard of the expression Panchsheel. It had its origin
in our country thousands of years ago but has acquired a new meaning
now. It is a code of conduct between the nations of the world. There are
long traditions as well as new ideas behind this concept which has
gradually spread and come to be accepted by many nations of the world.
There are only two courses open to the world today. One is of war and ruin
and the second is of peace and Panchsheel. There is no third path. The
world is gradually beginning to realize this.
       Today grave danger threatens us once again and the world is in
deadly peril. Good as well as bad things have happened in this month of
August. We meet here on the 15th of August to celebrate the anniversary
of our independence and the end of centuries of colonialism and
imperialism, and the beginning of a new era. It was in August that both the
world wars, in 1914 as well as 1939, began. It was in August that the
Second World War came to an end when Japan laid down its arms on the
15th of August. So it is an eventful month, full of dangers and at the same
time of a number of good things too. So we must be vigilant. Danger there
is in plenty because this is the age of nuclear weapons. There is no room
for complacency or forgetting our responsibilities even for a minute. Nor
can we afford to forget the lessons taught by Gandhiji. If we do, it is bound
to lead to ruin.
      I hope that in the conference which is going to be held in London from
tomorrow in connection with the Suez crisis, a way will be found to settle
this matter peacefully. We have friendly relations with all the countries and
particularly with Egypt and England. Therefore we are given the opportunity
to be of service to both through friendship. We do not use threats, for whom
can we threaten? I hope that through mutual consultations the participants
in the conference will find some way to uphold the honour and self-respect
of both sides. It is only those decisions which do not humiliate one side or
the other that are enduring. Humiliation sows the seeds of enmity and war.
If matters are settled by friendly methods, the solution is more permanent.
     Do you remember how the centuries old problem of India's
independence was solved? In spite of great difficulties and the atrocities
which were committed, it was solved by peaceful methods, friendship and
cooperation, with the result that there is no vestige of bitterness between
the British and us. We have even tried to forget the old bitterness
altogether and now we have friendly relations with England. We solved our
problems peacefully, in a civilized manner. If we had tried to use violence
or coercion, the pattern would have been quite different. We would have
become free but the bitterness would have remained for a long time. So
there is only one way of solving problems and that is by not humiliating
anyone and the preservation of rights and the self-respect of both sides. I
hope that the Suez crisis will also be solved like this. Even if it is not solved
in London efforts should continue. No problem will be solved by military
strength or threats because the consequences of such actions would be
disastrous. It could start a conflagration which would engulf the world.
       I just now mentioned Panchsheel, words which originated in India and
have spread all over the world. But when I look at India, I wonder how far
we have been able to understand the five principles ourselves. In the last
seven or eight months, we have seen some strange spectacles in the
country, with men fighting against their own kin. We fought the enemy
successfully and made friends with them and yet we do not have the
patience and understanding to solve our own internal problems. Has the
influence of Mahatma Gandhi vanished completely? Is it only the people of
my generation who were moulded by his teachings? Has it left the
succeeding generations so untouched that there is no self-control, mental
or physical, among them? What is the matter? I want you to think about
this. Our youth go out on the streets and beat up people. Is this the way to
show their bravery, by beating up their own kith and kin? In our time, we
have faced the guns and the might of a great empire without a word of
complaint. What are the youth made of today? Have the qualities in which
we were moulded and which led to India's freedom and fame in the world
disappeared? I am getting old. We have become old in the service of the
country. Our days are almost over. But we have proved what we were
capable of in the service of the country. We learnt a unique method of
working at Gandhiji's feet and we were proud of that. India acquired a great
name in the world. Therefore when people come out on the streets to fight
over petty issues, one wonders where India is going. All of you must think
about this.
       As you know the question of the reorganization of states has come
up. It is not a great political or economic issue but merely a matter of
administrative arrangement. I agree that it is a sentimental issue. I agree
that people are interested in it and their sentiments ought to be respected.
But it is absurd for people to fight with one another, and resort to arson, loot
and damaging public property. These will lead to the country's ruin. After
all, the ultimate decision will be taken by the Parliament which has
representatives from all over the country. And the people of India should
accept the decision of Parliament
       It is absurd that there should be riots against the decisions of
Parliament - there are cases of burning of government buildings, beating up
the police and what not. I want all of you and all the opposition parties in
India to think seriously about these matters. In a large country like ours,
there are bound to be different opinions and strands of thoughts. We want
that there should be complete freedom of expression so that we can
choose a path which is best suited to us. But debate is one thing, violence
another. Any party which leads India towards violence is not patriotic. It
strikes at the roots of India's freedom. Every individual and party in India
must think carefully about these things.
       Soon we are going to have general elections. Everyone has the right
to express his views and parties can present their programme to the people
and try to bring them round to their opinion. If you do not like the present
government, you are welcome to change it. I will be happy to serve in any
capacity. But violence and chaos have no connection with democracy. We
must think carefully where all this will lead us. Is the carefully moulded
civilization of India beginning to develop cracks? India has been moulded
by thousands of years of culture which cannot be taken away from us.
Secondly, we have been moulded by the freedom struggle. If the people
represent neither the old nor the new but believe only in hooliganism, how
can they serve India?
      New avenues are opening up. The Five Year Plans are big steps. But
they also impose a tremendous burden. We will have to face a great
challenge in the years to come and we will have to pit all our strength and
energy into the tasks ahead. To argue over the boundaries of states is
absurd. I want everyone, particularly the youth, to think where they are
going. Are we adhering to the principle of Panchsheel in our own country?
       Panchsheel means friendship with all the countries. How can we
practise that when we are not able to be friendly towards our own
neighbours? So long as we continue to fight over petty issues, no decision
can be arrived at. As far as the government is concerned, you have every
right to remove it from power. But threats will have no impact on us. The
decision of Parliament is binding and will be implemented. It cannot be
changed by such obstructionist tactics.
      Everyone must understand quite clearly that the decision of the Lok
Sabha about the states reorganization will be binding. You have put me in
a position of great honour. But ultimately it is the will of Parliament which is
supreme and all of us will have to bow to it. Everyone must understand this
clearly. There are legal, constitutional methods of changing the decisions of
Parliament. But anyone who thinks he can change the decisions by rioting
is mistaken. It would be an unpatriotic act against national interest.
      On this ninth anniversary of our independence, we must look back as
well as to the future. India has come a long way in nine years and the new
India which is emerging is held in great respect in the world. We must keep
our eyes on the future and march ahead. We must implement the Five Year
Plans with strength and determination and pour all our energy into it. We
cannot afford to fritter away our strength in futile acts. We have to build a
new India by getting rid of poverty and unemployment and reducing the
disparity between the haves and the have-nots. India must emerge as a
strong and prosperous nation and serve humanity and the cause of peace.
These are difficult tasks. But we are accustomed to difficulties. On this day,
we must not only look back on our past, but also look at the future and take
a pledge to abide by our ancient culture and civilization, and not stray from
our chosen path.
      This year we are celebrating yet another great anniversary. Two
thousand and five hundred years ago Gautama Buddha attained nirvana.
The Buddha is held in great reverence not only in India but all over the
world because what he stood for are enduring, eternal truths which do not
disappear with the passing of time.
       One feels proud that the soil on which we have been born has
produced great souls like Gautama Buddha and Gandhiji. There is
something in this soil which has kept the nation together by a strong bond.
It is something spiritual which is reflected in our ancient culture and
civilization. Let us refresh our memories once again and pay homage to
Gautama Buddha and Gandhiji and great souls like them who have
moulded this country. Let us follow the path shown by them with strength
and determination and cooperation.
     Jai Hind. Please say Jai Hind with me thrice."
1955,Jawaharlal Nehru,INC,Decisions through Peaceful Means,"Speech at the Red Fort, Delhi, 15 August 1955, AIR tapes, NMML. Original in Hindi.","Selected works of Jawaharlal Nehru. Second Series. Vol 29, (1 June 1955 - 31 August 1955)",http://nehruportal.nic.in/selected-works-jawahar-lal-nehru-second-series-29#page/74/mode/2up,"Today we are assembled once again on the anniversary of India's
independence. Greetings to everyone on this auspicious occasion. Do you
remember that day when we reached this goal after a long journey and
many ups and downs? Many people stumbled and fell, picked themselves
up and moved on again. Do you remember the dreams we dreamt and the
hopes that filled our hearts. Then came a day when those dreams and
hopes were fulfilled and we saw the sun emerging on free India. Eight
years have passed since that day when the whole of India went wild with
joy. But in the moment of joy and triumph came tears too at the inhuman
atrocities that took place on both sides of the border. Innumerable refugees
trekked for hundreds of miles to cross the borders on both sides. We had to
face this grave crisis. Well, we bore our troubles and tried to solve those
problems quite successfully. We will undoubtedly solve the rest too. In this
way, eight years have passed, with a great many ups and downs. Just think
back to the condition we were in eight years ago and the way world saw us
and the difference that has come about in the entire scene since then.
Independent India is still in her infancy, though our nation is thousands of
years old. But the world knows of our achievements and the capacity to
advance that we have shown even in these few years.
      So when we meet here, we look back towards the past and the last
eight years especially, as well as to the future. We must take stock of what
we have done and what remains to be done. There is a tremendous
amount that still has to be dealt with. We must pay special attention to our
weaknesses, for it is only to the extent that we succeed in removing those
weaknesses will the country advance and the people prosper. Turning
towards the world, you will find that we have not raised our hand against
any nation of the world and I hope that we shall never do so. We have
looked upon everyone with friendly eyes and extended the hand of
friendship and peace. There have been some complicated issues but that
was no reason for us to be hostile to anyone. Ultimately, the policy of
peace and friendship that we are following is the only right one for the
world. We want to have friendly relations and cooperation with our
neighbouring countries. You would have known about the strengthening of
relations in the recent past. You must have heard about Panch Shila which
lays down the norms of conduct between nations. Gradually all the newly
independent countries have accepted these principles and the atmosphere
in the world has changed for the better. I do not say that this is because of
us there have been other events in the world. So we must not be proud or
boastful about it. It is sufficient if we can help in our own small way. But
what makes us happy is that the atmosphere in the world is definitely better
than before, the fear and anxiety with which nations used to regard one
another have become less, and there is a readiness among them to extend
the hand of a we are happy.
       We are at peace with all the countries of the world. But on this day,
the 15th of August, our thoughts turn towards Goa. When we were busy
fighting for our freedom, could you or anyone in the world have thought that
while India would become free, the small pockets of Goa or Pondicherry or
any other place would remain under European rule? It was inconceivable
and we did not even dream of such a thing. Pondicherry and Goa have
been separated from us for the last two or three hundred years. They could
flourish separately under the protection of the huge British empire in India
just as the innumerable princely states existed with the blessings of the
British. The moment the British left, all those princely states also had to go.
So it is rather strange that anyone should ask us why we want Goa to
merge with India. Where is the question of merging with India? Hasn't
anyone seen the map of India and the world and where Goa is? It is a part
of India and nobody can separate it. Today we are celebrating the eighth
anniversary of our independence. As the world has seen, we have shown a
great deal of patience in these eight years. We have exercised great
self-control because we want that this issue should be solved peacefully.
Let me tell you once again today that we have no intention of taking military
action in Goa but will solve it by peaceful methods. Let no one be under a
misconception that we are going to take military action. I am saying this
because people abroad as well as in India are sometimes misled. Rumours
are being circulated abroad that we are amassing tanks and guns and our
army there. It is all wrong. There are no forces near Goa. People within the
country want to create a situation by making a great deal of noise whereby
we will be forced to march in. We will not send in our forces and we will
settle the matter peacefully. Let everyone understand this clearly. Those
who are going into Goa are welcome to do so, but if they call themselves
satyagrahis, let them remember the principles of satyagraha and behave
accordingly. Armies do not march behind satyagrahis. Nor is there a call for
them. They are supposed to face the issue themselves in a completely
different way.
        We have seen recently that the satyagrahis were fired upon on a
number of occasions and some young men died as a result. Guns are fired
in wars and that has to be faced. But the world must seriously consider how
far it is proper or right for any nation to fire upon unarmed people. If a law is
broken, the government has the right to arrest the culprits and put them in
jails. But nowhere in international law or any law governing civilized
behaviour is it written that unarmed people who are not mounting any kind
of an attack should be fired upon. It is absolutely wrong. I would like to
point out very politely that the world and the Portuguese Government must
understand quite clearly that they must not indulge in such uncivilized
behaviour. There is a conflict between us but whatever their views may be,
we wish to solve the problem peacefully and will undoubtedly do so, no
matter how long it takes. Please bear in mind that it is wrong to think that
such issues can be resolved by magic immediately. If we wish to arrive at a
proper solution, being in a hurry will not help. We must wait because
anything which is done slowly and with patience is likely to be more firm
and abiding.
      I mentioned Panch Shila and drew your attention to the changing
atmosphere in the world. Take the internal situation, for ultimately, our
stature in the world depends on what we do in our own country. We shall
not gain in stature by shouting slogans or talking irresponsibly. We are
judged by what we are doing in the country. I feel that we have achieved a
great deal in the last eight years and have laid the foundation of the edifice
of new India and now the time has come to build on it. The foundations are
strong and will become stronger still. The First Five Year Plan will come to
an end soon and the Second will start in a few months. We must prepare
ourselves for it by tightening our belts and must be ready for any hardship
because we are building a nation not merely for the present but for the
future and all the coming generations. It has to be a strong nation and built
with hard labour.
      I talked about Panch Shila in the context of international relations. In
the olden days this word was used in a different sense. It meant discipline
and self-control, good behaviour towards others and so on. How can we
have a high stature in the world if we are weak internally? How can we talk
about peace elsewhere if there is no peace in our hearts? If we cannot
cooperate with one another, how can we advise others? Therefore, it is
even more important for us to remove our weaknesses.
       This wonderful country of ours, India, has so many facets and forms,
so many religions, and shades of opinions, so many regions and provinces.
All of them together have gone into the making of modern India. We are
one large family and there should be no barriers of province and religion
and caste among us. We must break down any barriers that exist. We must
remove casteism, for it is responsible for our living in separate
compartments. It has weakened India, a great deal in the past. So while we
must preserve India's wonderful diversity, we must at the same time
remember that we belong to one family and have to march together
towards the new goal that is before us.
       Secondly, whatever we do, it must be done by peaceful methods. I
want to remind you of this particularly because we talk of peace but often
raise our hands in violence against one another. What is the meaning of
such things? Just two days ago an incident occurred in the city of Patna.
Why are we so ready to do violence? Why is it that our students get so
easily involved in such things? Do they lack patience and understanding?
Don't they know that they are citizens of independent India? Have they
failed to breathe in the air of freedom and are still thinking on the old lines?
Those times are gone now. If there is tension among workers or anyone
else, and especially if the students come into conflict with their teachers
and indulge in violence, they earn a bad name for themselves as well as for
the country, instead of preparing themselves for the responsibilities that the
future will bring. I plead with all of you, especially our youth, to realize your
responsibilities and understand the spirit of modern age. The whole world
has taken a new turn. This is the age of the atom and atomic energy. We
have to change our thinking and get out of the old rut of petty feuds and
quarrels. I want the people of India to understand these things and take
advantage of the new forces being generated in the world. Therefore, it
becomes necessary for us to solve all our problems by peaceful methods.
       Another complex problem is about to come up in the country. As you
may remember, some time ago a commission was appointed called the
States Reoreanimation Commission. It will make recommendations for
reorganizing the boundaries of the various provinces. We selected three
eminent people to study this question in depth and make their
recommendations. They have been working on it for the last year and a
half. I think they will present their report within the next two months. I do not
know what their recommendations will be. I cannot express an opinion. But
what I want to say is that in spite of the great heat that is bound to be
generated over this issue from the Punjab to the south and from east to
west, we must take a decision on the recommendations of the Commission
peacefully. Whoever creates a stir over it will not be a well-wisher of the
country. For after all it is only a question of separate provinces, not
separate countries. These divisions have been made for our administrative
convenience. No decision will be acceptable to everyone. But an effort will
be made and I hope that the Commission is already making such an effort
to recommend whatever will be acceptable to the majority. Whatever
happens, we must accept it peacefully after due consideration. There
should be no quarrel over this issue. We must show the world how we
solve our problems peacefully, and with confidence in ourselves. That is
the real sign of strength, not shouting slogans and making a noise. That is
childishness. Though independent India is only eight years old, our country
is an ancient one. It is a grand country which speaks with a serious voice. It
is not our practice to shout or rant and rave. This is not the time for such
things. We have to add to our strength, always act peacefully and with
patience, extend the hand of friendship towards other countries and behave
in a civilized way. Whatever problems arise, they must be solved peacefully
and harmoniously.
       I talked to you about Panch Shila. There are two aspects to it. One
concerns international relations of friendship, non-interference in one
another's internal affairs, equality and mutual cooperation. The second
aspect of Panch Shila concerns us internally, it consists of right conduct,
alertness, self-control, unity and harmony, through these we can build,
strengthen the large family of the people of India. This is a very old lesson
taught to us thousands of years ago and is before us once again. Please
bear in mind that unless we teach ourselves this lesson. we have no right
to preach it to others. It would be arrogance to presume to teach others. If
we learn the lesson well and put it into practice, we can show the others by
example. Therefore, while it is proper that we should celebrate the eighth
anniversary of India's freedom and take stock of our achievements in the
last eight years, in reality we must concentrate our attention on the tasks
that are waiting to be done. We have reached one goal and now we have
to travel towards another, and that journey should also be peaceful.


       Let us pay homage to the thousands of people by whose toil and
sacrifice and martyrdom, India became free. Let us hear once again the
ancient voice of India, and at the same time pay heed to the new voice of
the modern age too. The voice of our ancestors is ringing in our ears.
      A year from now we shall be celebrating a great event in this country
and the world. Next year it will be 2500 years since the death of Gautama
Buddha, one of the greatest souls of India. This anniversary will be
celebrated all over the world. On this occasion we must remember once
again the principles and ideals that this great Indian gave to this country.
We must also remember the Father of the Nation, Mahatma Gandhi, who
lived and toiled in our own lifetime. India owes her present greatness to him
and the path shown by him. If we follow those principles our steps will be
firm and we shall be stout-hearted and straightforward. Let us think about
all this and march ahead. Jai Hind. Please say Jai Hind with me thrice."
1954,Jawaharlal Nehru,INC,The Meaning of Freedom,"Speech at a public meeting on Independence Day, Red Fort, New Delhi, 15 August 1954. MPCC Papers, NMML. Original in Hindi.","Selected works of Jawaharlal Nehru. Second Series. Vol 26, (1 June 1954 - 30 September 1954)",http://nehruportal.nic.in/selected-works-jawahar-lal-nehru-second-series-26#page/132/mode/2up,"Brothers, sisters and friends, greetings on the anniversary of
Independence of new India. It has been seven years since this new India
was born, seven years since we became free. We celebrate this
anniversary every year under the ramparts of Red Fort because on this
day, for all of us, the hundreds and thousands of us in India, life took a new
turn and a fresh chapter of Indian history began. Now in these seven years,
what has the young, seven-year old India achieved? How has it
progressed? Which way is it headed? Where will it go? These are big
questions before us. If you search your hearts, you will see that there is a
new life in India and a new confidence in itself, and a wave of electric
excitement has spread through the hundreds and lakhs of villages in India.
The sleeping millions have awakened, and other people, who are
continuing to do their old jobs, have turned in a new direction with their
bodies, hearts and minds. So this is the atmosphere in India today, I know
and you know that we face many difficulties and many of our brethren are
in dire straits. But all of us know that you and I are travelling on a new road
together.
       It was seven years ago that we became independent but what is the
meaning of that independence? It is not the ultimate goal of our journey.
We cannot sit back just because we have become independent. Our
journey has not ended because we have achieved Independence. That is
merely the first step in a country's journey towards progress. Independence
for a country is never a completion, it has to be carried forward. A nation
which is alive never stops, it has to go forward. Our country became fully
independent politically, though there are one or two pockets still to achieve
freedom. But India is quite determined that they will do so. Whatever India
decides to do, her millions will definitely accomplish it.
      When I say that we cannot stop with India's Independence, what
does it mean? It means that Independence does not imply mere political
independence. Independence and freedom have other meanings too.
There is social freedom, economic freedom to achieve. If there is poverty in
a country, freedom does not reach the people. Those who are caught in the
net of poverty cannot really be free. We have to free them. Similarly, if we
are divided by inner quarrels and factions and build up walls of hatred
instead of living in harmony and amity, then, too, we cannot really be
considered free.
      If India is to be really free, we have to do many things. We have to
eradicate unemployment and poverty. Please remember that those walls
which have been built up in the name of religion, caste and province and
which create tensions, show that our minds and hearts are not truly free,
however much the outer form may have changed. It also shows our
narrow-mindedness. If there is even one village in India where an Indian --
to whatever caste he may belong, let us say, a Harijan, an untouchable --
faces restrictions on living and eating, drinking, etc, that village is not free; it
is actually in bondage. We have to free every single person in this country.
The freedom of a country does not mean the well-being of a few, a
country's freedom has to be seen from the point of view of the common
man's living conditions, his difficulties and the opportunities of progress
available to him.
      So we are still on the road to Independence. Please do not think we
have reached our goal. That goal is ahead of us because we are a strong
and dynamic nation, set on the path of progress. We will progress. The
world has to progress. In recent years, changes have come about in our
country, we have been reborn. Similarly, revolutionary changes are taking
place all over the world. There are various kinds of disparities and all sorts
of changes are continually taking place. In these years, all manners of
events have been taking place in this great continent of Asia. For hundreds
of years, it had been dominated by foreign powers. Foreign domination has
come to an end in some places but, to some extent, it still remains.
Compare this with what happened in India and Burma. Seven years ago,
India and Burma became independent and these issues were solved in a
friendly way when the foreign power went away from here. We had no
enmity either with the British or with their army or their people. Our fight
was with the British rule in India. When that was removed, we no longer
had any quarrel with them. In fact we became friends. Foreign rule existed
in many other countries of Asia and elsewhere. But they did not take this
sensible step. What was the result? Seven years of fighting, seven years of
ruination of hundreds of thousands of people. Nations were ruined, in Asia
and in Europe, and the world reached the brink of a large-scale war. So
you can see what evils can result if the natural flow of events is stopped.
This did not happen in India because good sense prevailed. What was
inevitable was accepted here and so India has progressed and so has the
world. Burma became independent and helped towards world peace. There
was delay and obstruction in other countries. Please remember that in
Indonesia too, foreign rule was removed but after much fighting. Look at
the difficulties the foreign powers had to face wherever they forcibly stayed
on. The reason is that the time has gone when one country can hope to
rule over another by force. For good or for bad, it has passed. Those who
want to hold on to it understand neither the world nor the Asian mind.
       Some of the questions which are arising before us today are actually
old ones. One of these concerns small bits of territories of India, the size of
a few villages, which are still under political domination. But even a small
splinter in the body gives a great deal of pain. This problem should have
been solved a long time ago. But we adopted peaceful methods. We tried
to solve the problem by negotiations. I feel that the problem relating to
French possessions will be solved soon. Some difficulties have arisen in
the case of Portuguese possessions. But assuredly these problems will
also be solved. As you all know, we have to continue to follow certain
principles, which we adopted in order to achieve Independence. And you
must remember that that is how we have maintained our Independence. As
you know, we must work together according to the principles of
non-violence. I do not say that I or you have succeeded fully in following
these principles always. We are all weak, we falter and may fall. We can
never follow that path successfully all the time. But we have to remember
that, as a principle, it is very sound and our country will gain in stature and
strength to the extent we succeed in working in accordance with these
principles courageously and bravely and not like cowards. We shall also
succeed to that extent in serving our people and the cause of world peace.
       We have tried to experiment with this principle on the world stage
because now that we are independent, whether we like it or not, we Indians
are going to have a role to play in world affairs. The eyes of the world are
on us. India is an ancient country, which has seen many ups and downs
and which has been a slave country for the last two or three hundred years.
After all, what has the country learnt from its 200 or 250 years of bondage?
What will she do now? Which way will she lean? Because when nearly four
hundred million lean one way, it is bound to have some effect on the world.
After all, we are about one fifth of the world population. So the world looks
at us and we have tried to serve the world. The first service that we can do
to the world is to pull ourselves together, serve our country and make her
strong and rich. The second thing that we can do for the world is to throw
our weight on the side of peace and try to stop wars from taking place. It is
obvious that ours is not a mighty country, militarily strong. There are many
powers in the world which have great armies, air forces and unlimited
wealth. How can we hope to compete with them? We are newcomers in the
field. We have to put our own house in order. So what can we do? But we
represent a principle, an effort, and behind that is the guiding spirit of a
great man, Mahatma Gandhi. We have learned to walk with faltering steps
on that path. Sometimes we stumbled and fell. But we kept going, keeping
that principle, that ideal, before us and we have tried to introduce it to the
world without waging a war with any country.
       As you know, less than four years ago, some countries which were at
war among themselves and would not sit down to talk things over
peacefully, suddenly thought of India as a mediator. Both sides put their
faith in India. Our forces went out as they had done quite often in olden
times too but this time on a different mission. Then they used to go and
fight with other countries. But, now, that time is past. We do not wish to
fight with anyone under any circumstances. We shall not fight unless we
are compelled to. Our forces went out but not to fight. They went out under
the banner of our beautiful flag in the name of peace to serve others. They
went to Korea. Then, as you know, we received yet another invitation from
the big powers to mediate in Indo-China. Again, we have accepted it,
though it is a very big task and a great burden involving a lot of difficulties.
But we could not refuse because it was an opportunity to work for world
peace. So we accepted. We are represented by our ambassadors there
just now. Besides us, there are two other countries on the Commission,
namely, Canada and Poland. All three of us will work together. Our people
have gone there and accepted the mantle of peace. We may have to send
more people soon for this task — some from the army and others. It is a big
task. So you can see how India is making a name for herself in the world by
working for peace and friendship, and not for destruction and war. I know
that India and Indians have always been known for friendship and peace
and love.
       We may make a name for ourselves in the world. But what should we
do at home? Our strength or weakness depends on our conduct at home. If
we follow these principles at home, then we shall be honoured in the world.
And if we do not, all our talk is in vain. So we have to apply at home the
principles of mutual cooperation and friendship. We have to work together
even if there are hundreds of religious beliefs. If anyone belonging to a
particular religion thinks that he has an exclusive right over India and no
one else, we shall disown him. It would mean that he has failed to
understand the principle on which Indian nationalism and Indian
Independence are based. In fact, in a sense, he becomes an enemy of our
Independence. He deals a blow to our Independence, which will be
shattered because the basis of India's Independence is secularism. People
belonging to different religious sects and castes of India have to live
together in amity. They should respect one another and show consideration
for others. We have different castes thinking of themselves as higher or
lower than others in our country—which has created many barriers and
tensions, and given us a bad name and weakened us. We have to combat
this casteism until we succeed in eradicating it completely from our country.
We can give no quarter to it. What it did in the olden times was deplorable.
There is no longer any place for it in modern times. And whoever regards it
with the slightest sympathy or acquiescence, is a coward, and he does not
understand the message that India is trying to convey. The message of
India today is that everyone in India is politically equal and has to become
socially equal and, as far as possible, economically equal as well. All this
disparity, whether it be of wealth or of social standing, is not good. Only in
this way can we serve our country, make it strong and carry it forward on
the road to progress, and, thus, armed with a new strength, we can serve
the world too.
       We shall make a new India. A new India is, in fact, being created.
You have seen how the work put in in the last few years has slowly taken
effect this year. You have seen how our food problem has been solved —
the prices of foodgrains have gone down and production has increased. As
you have also seen, production in factories is increasing. Ultimately, if the
poverty in India is to be eradicated, it can only be done by increasing
production. Wealth does not mean gold or silver. They are for only traders
and businessmen to play about with. The wealth of a country is what it
produces from land, from factories and cottage industries — in short,
through human labour. We have to produce that kind of wealth. As we have
produced more from land, we have been able to solve the problem of food.
The factories are increasing their production and new factories will be
coming up. And you might have seen that the big river valley projects like
Bhakra-Nangal are nearing completion, and the people will now benefit
from them. In this way, 36 crore people are going ahead. If you go to the
villages, you will see all kinds of projects going on and we have to spread
them throughout India. It has been decided to spread them among a few
million people every year. Our aim is that every village in India should come
under this scheme within the next seven years. There are six hundred
thousand villages in India. So our goal is not a small one. And our country
is not a small one. We have to take big steps, undertake great tasks, win
big victories. But our victories will not be over others, neither do we wish to
suppress anyone. Our victories will mean the victory of others too. This is
India's policy internally and in our external affairs too.
      Why is it that India is today among the very few countries whose
doors are open to everyone? We invite the people of all countries to come
here. We have no enmity with anyone. Our brothers in Pakistan are often
angry and unhappy with us. All sorts of problems came between us. But, as
I have repeatedly said, we harbour no thoughts of war. We want to love
them and cooperate with them, because we understand that such close
neighbours as India and Pakistan should live in amity with each other.
Neither benefits from losses suffered by the other. We should move with
this approach. That does not mean that we should give up our principles or
let our prestige suffer out of fear. We have to stand firmly by our principles
and remember that we are pursuing the path of peace, not of war.
        I referred to you just now to the areas which are in India but have still
not got Independence. Goa is one of them. Even there, our policy has been
one of peace. But I would like to tell you that Goa is a test for us and you
can say it is a test for the Portuguese, though it is difficult for a nation which
speaks with a language three or four hundred years old to realize this.
Whether it is a test for the Portuguese or ourselves, it is certainly a trial for
the whole world. I want you to understand this. In a sense, I would say it
has become a testing ground to see which side the nations of the world
lean when it is a question of one country ruling over another that is, of
colonialism, or whatever you may call it. Goa cannot radically change
India's fortunes by becoming part of her, nor will Portugal be enriched by
retaining Goa. But it is like the scar of an old boil, of one country ruling over
another. How can any one say that it is an old boil and so we must put up
with the pain? They do not understand our mind or that of Asia. And so this
is a trial for the other countries. We do not want any country to intervene in
the solution of the problem or extend help in this matter. But we want to
probe their minds to see what they are thinking, which way they are leaning
and what their advice would be, though it is a strange way of measuring
things. Their minds are old-fashioned. Today's world is a new world. If the
light from the new world does not penetrate their minds and they continue
to be old-fashioned, then they will definitely fall once again. I gave you an
example just now of how the world has gained by the fact that India
achieved Independence and is progressing. But Independence has yet to
be realized in many other parts of Asia. Fighting has been going on for
years, bringing ruin in its wake. The world is moving at a fast pace. How
can anyone hope to arrest big floods? And if it is a human flood, an attempt
to control it can only have disastrous consequences. So I feel that Goa is
also a test of the other countries of the world. If they give wrong advice, the
situation worsens. If they adopt the right course, problems can be solved in
a peaceful way.
      I would like to remind you once again that India has embarked on a
long journey. People belonging to various castes and religions, like Hindus,
Muslims, Sikhs, Christians, Buddhists and Jains, are all Indians and, in that
capacity, they keep marching ahead, and the country also progresses.
       How does a nation become affluent and emerge out of its poverty?
By hard work. We cannot look to the stars to help us — we do not want
their help. We do not want anyone's help. We have strength in our
shoulders and our minds. We shall progress by working together in peace
and harmony. So I invite you on this anniversary, yours and mine, of our
Independence for, when a country becomes independent, each one of its
citizens becomes independent and so your anniversary and mine — the
eighth anniversary of the Independence of new India, to participate in this
long journey, so that we can work hard with our full strength and uplift the
towns and villages of India. Jai Hind."
1953,Jawaharlal Nehru,INC,India Faces Tremendous Tasks,"Speech delivered at Red Fort, Delhi, on the occasion of Independence Day, 15 August 1953, AIR tapes, NMML. Original in Hindi.","Selected works of Jawaharlal Nehru. Second Series. Vol 23, (1 July 1953 - 30 September 1953)",http://nehruportal.nic.in/selected-works-jawahar-lal-nehru-second-series-23#page/102/mode/2up,"Sisters, brothers and fellow countrymen, today is the sixth birthday of
free India — the sixth anniversary of the day that we were re-born.
Greetings to all of you on this occasion. We must first pay homage to the
memory of that soul who was responsible for making India free, who
breathed fresh life into a withered nation and made it almost as good as
new. We must think of Mahatma Gandhi before we do anything else today.
What does that mean? A great man came amongst us, shone like a bright
star and then passed on. To think of him means refreshing our memories
about the lessons that he taught us. What did he teach us? We must
remember once again the principles by which we became strong and
ultimately won freedom. If we forget those fundamental principles, we shall
become weak and fail to do what we have set out to do.
        The history of our country goes back thousands of years. India has
occupied a very high position and has also fallen time and again. We must
remember the things that gave us strength and those that weakened us.
We must think about those fundamental things and our future goal and how
we should try to reach it. We must also remember that that goal cannot be
reached by wrong methods. Wrong means do not yield right results. This is
a fundamental principle which we cannot forget. We reaped the fruits of
right action and got freedom. But at the very moment when we were
celebrating our victory, and I had unfurled this flag from this very spot, a
terrible thing happened. There was a holocaust in Pakistan and in north
India and millions of uprooted human beings trekked from both sides in
search of refuge and shelter. We are paying the price for that terrible
disaster till this evil can fail to leave its traces behind just as no good can
fail to produce good results.
       We have to think calmly about the tremendous tasks before us — the
task of uplifting the thirty-six crores of Indians by making them better off
and removing their difficulties. It is a tremendous task to build a new
country out of a very ancient one. Where does our duty lie? It is obvious
that the most important duty is to protect our freedom. Secondly, it is
important to form friendly ties with all the countries of the world and
cooperate with them. We must not interfere in the affairs of any other
country, nor should we tolerate any interference in our internal affairs. This
is the path we must follow. The third important question is what we are
going to do within the country. How are we going to make this large family
of thirty-six crore human beings better off? Can families survive if they fight
among themselves constantly and build barriers? We must remove the
barriers that separate us. We must get rid of communalism because it is a
wall that keeps us in separate compartments and weakens us. It breaks up
the large Indian family into segments and fosters enmity between brothers.
We must get rid of provincialism because if we put our province before the
country, we shall slip back. We must put our country before everything else
and remember that if India progresses, all of us will progress too and if she
remains backward, no one in the country can go ahead, even if a district or
a province might make some progress. Another thing which keeps us in
separate compartments and weakens us is the ancient vice of casteism, for
it encourages people to put their own narrow caste before their country.
      There are tremendous tasks before us, the task of economic
reconstruction, and of making the condition of people in India better by
putting an end to unemployment and poverty. Ultimately, the strength of a
country lies not in idle talk and building castles in the air, but in its
economic conditions and in the character of the people and their unity. We
have got political freedom but it is incomplete. It will be complete only when
we solve our economic problems and freedom is within the reach of every
single Indian. This is the most urgent task in which we are engaged at
present, of removing poverty and unemployment from the country, so that
every man and woman in India may produce wealth for themselves as well
as for the country and thus increase our strength. These are the big tasks
before us.
      As far as world affairs are concerned, we must make efforts to
establish peace in the world and prevent wars. We are striving towards this.
We do not wish to get involved in world affairs for we want to set our own
order first. But we have done what little we could and our efforts have been
appreciated and, at the same time, our responsibilities have increased. As
you know, we are sending some of our troops to Korea. Why are these
forces being sent? In the past, forces used to be sent out to fight in other
countries, but our forces are going out not for war but for peace. Our forces
are going at the invitation of other countries who are fighting with one
another. They are agreed upon one thing and that is to invite our forces to
come and do their duty. We do not wish to take on the additional
responsibilities of the world but there are some duties which we cannot
evade. So our forces are going to Korea. There is a talk of peace again in
the world and to make an effort to change the atmosphere in the world
away from war. Those efforts are being made but it is my regret that some
people are still speaking the language of threats and aggrandisement. If we
want peace in the world, it cannot be done by threatening one another or
striking fear in others' hearts but by extending a firm hand of friendship. So
the talk of peace is welcome and it would be better if some nations which
are involved also change their thinking a little. Mere talk of peace cannot
help unless there is a change of outlook.
        So we are trying to discharge our duties abroad and at home
establishing peace and improving the economic condition in the country.
Big tasks have been accomplished in the last six years and I think that
when history is written, all that has happened in this period will find mention
in it. But at the same time it is also true that many of the things which we
wished to do could not be done. The task is gigantic and the workers seem
very few but if everyone pulls his weight the burden will be lighter.
      A week ago, there were some incidents in Kashmir which caused our
neighbour, Pakistan, much anxiety. I do not wish to say much about those
incidents, because this is not the proper occasion. But I do wish to tell you
that you must not pay heed to rumours and be constantly vigilant. I am
amazed at the false news and rumours being published in Pakistani
newspapers during the last few days about Kashmir and what our forces
are supposed to have done or not done there. I wish to say very forcefully
that our forces had no hand in those incidents. What is the meaning of
spreading such rumours in Pakistan and in some other countries by
journalists? It is absurd and absolutely wrong to spread rumours and
unnecessarily to incite people and foment bitterness between the countries.
It is an internal matter of Kashmir. I am sorry about the recent incidents
because it is always a matter of regret when there is a parting of ways
between old friends and colleagues and I can tell you that it is not proper to
talk ill of others on such occasions. If we do so, it is bound to boomerang
on us. We are unhappy, but sometimes whatever our feelings may be, we
have to do our duty with dignity and by the right means, always keeping in
mind our fundamental principles. As I said, many things that have
happened in Kashmir have made us unhappy. There is a story behind it
and there have been other incidents elsewhere which have incited the
people of Kashmir to some extent, like the communal incidents which
occurred in Delhi and the Punjab. It is strange that they have succeeded in
doing just the opposite of what they had wished to do. So you can see how
bring about undesirable results, even if your intentions are pure.
      I was talking about Kashmir. I want to repeat what I had said earlier,
that we shall stick by the promise made five and a half years ago that the
fate of Kashmir will be decided by the people of Kashmir. This is absolutely
certain even today and there will be no interference or coercion on our part.
The second thing is that a new Government was formed in Kashmir last
week, but it is obvious that it can last only so long as they represent the
people of Kashmir and are accepted by the elected Assembly. Otherwise
another Government will have to be formed. Our principles apply equally all
over India as well as in Kashmir.
      So these incidents occurred in Kashmir and I can understand that
they may have caused you some surprise for you were not fully aware of
the past history. But it has been blown out of all proportion and all sorts of
rumours were spread which increased the panic among the people, and in
other nations, especially our neighbour, Pakistan, where there was a
strange hostility and anger. Views were expressed on this issue which have
no relationship with reality. I am not here to criticize anyone but to express
my sorrow that we should be so easily led astray and incited. This is not the
way to solve major problems. I want to warn you that there are bound to be
major issues and crises in India and the world and we shall be put to test.
The question is whether we can think and act calmly and peacefully or rush
around here and there in a blind panic. A nation is tested in this way and
the more insurmountable the problems, the calmer we ought to be and act
peacefully and wisely. When we have accepted the fundamental principle
that the people of Kashmir will decide for themselves, there is no room for
argument. We can certainly discuss the means by which this is to be done.
But there can be no argument about principles. We have said this
repeatedly ever since the Kashmir issue came up before us. We have also
maintained that Kashmir has a special status. When it agreed to join India,
we welcomed it. But even then, we have given it a special status owing to
geographical and various other reasons. If people make a noise after all
this and demand that Kashmir should have equal status with other States,
they have obviously failed to understand the circumstances and the real
situation. They can see that it has had just the opposite result.
       I referred to Pakistan. I went to Pakistan a few days ago at the
invitation of their Government and the people welcomed me with great
affection. It had a powerful influence on me, especially the love of the
people which was very similar to what you might find in any part of India. I
found the same thing in Karachi and realized that after all I was not in any
foreign country and there was not much difference between our country
and theirs. I saw many familiar faces there, of old friends and colleagues
and people who had gone away from India. The picture was the same,
except for a few differences. In short, I did not feel for a moment that I was
in some foreign country. This is the picture just now and it is possible that it
may change if the people's attitude changes through some
misunderstanding. So you can see from this how people's behaviour
depends on the way they are treated. I want that we should not budge from
our principles and ideals but follow the right path of friendship with all
countries, even with Pakistan, and if there is any misunderstanding, it will
be cleared up in due course. If there is constant tension and bitterness
between our countries, it cannot be good for either India or Pakistan. Fear
can never yield good results and so we must not live in constant fear. The
Prime Minister of Pakistan is coming here at our invitation just as I went to
Karachi at their invitation. I want that the citizens of this ancient and historic
city of Delhi should give him a grand welcome and show our
large-heartedness and goodwill. It is possible that during his stay here,
there may be a reception for him from this very Red Fort and in other
places too.
       So I want that all of us as a nation must remember the principles and
ideals of Mahatma Gandhi on this day. We must think of our success but
more so of our failures and the moments when we slipped in the last five or
six years, because we have a lesson to learn from them. Let us once again
take a pledge under this beloved flag of ours that we shall serve our
country and promote unity among the people of various religions because
everyone has an equal share in India's freedom. We must get rid of the
barriers of provincialism, casteism and communalism and make the country
strong. We must harness all our strength towards building a new India and
not fritter it away in futile quarrels. We must also pledge that we shall try to
establish peace in the world and extend a hand of friendship to all
countries. We have to fight one battle, which we shall with all our might,
and that battle is against the poverty of India. It is likely to be a long-drawn
out battle and will require a great deal of hard work and sweat and tears.
But it is worthwhile cause to uplift the millions of Indians and make them
better off. This is no small task. This is our goal and we cannot rest till we
reach it. You must remember these principles and go ahead. The life of a
nation goes on, it is never-ending, and one goal follows another. We may
come and go, but India is everlasting. Our only desire is that in the time that
is given to us, we should also serve her a little and then pass on the mantle
to the succeeding generations so that they may also share the memories of
the freedom struggle and the hardships and sacrifices which had gone into
the making of a new India.
      Please say Jai Hind with me three times. Jai Hind, Jai Hind, Jai Hind."
1952,Jawaharlal Nehru,INC,Five Years of Freedom,"Speech from the ramparts of the Red Fort, Delhi, 15 August 1952. AIR tapes, NMML. (Original in Hindi)","Selected works of Jawaharlal Nehru. Second Series. Vol 19, (16 July 1952 - 18 October 1952)",http://nehruportal.nic.in/selected-works-jawahar-lal-nehru-second-series-19#page/40/mode/2up,"Brothers and sisters, today is the fifth anniversary of Indian
Independence. Five years ago, on this day, we had assembled at this spot
in the old city of Delhi and unfurled the flag of freedom from the ramparts of
the Red Fort. It heralded the beginning of a new chapter in Indian history.
Five years have gone by since then. There have been big ups and downs
in this period. We have been able to achieve something, but a great deal
still remains to be done.
      We, the millions in India, became heirs to a great heritage five years
ago, the heritage of this vast country which spreads from the Himalayas to
Kanyakumari. But it is something more than that, for India's history dates
back to thousands of years. We became heirs to thousands of years of
history and grandeur and ups and downs which India has witnessed in
past.
       Where does our duty lie? How are we to mould the history of India
and contribute to her vast heritage for the generations to come? Five years
is not a very long period in the history of a nation. But these five years have
been momentous in the history of the world and of India. We have had to
face big problems. It is now for the historians to give their verdict about our
achievements and failures. We should not keep harking back to the past,
but look forward to the future. Duty calls, and the tasks left incomplete are
constantly with us.
       The tasks of a nation are, of course, never ending. There are millions
of things waiting to be done and the process will never end. We can
measure our achievements by the number of new buildings and schools
and other constructions that have been completed. But the real yardstick to
measure the worth of our work is to see to what extent we have succeeded
in wiping the tears from the eyes of the poor who continue to be in misery.
That is the real yardstick of India's progress, not the construction of
buildings and grand projects that we have undertaken.
     India is not a mere geographical expression extending from the
Himalayas to Kanyakumari. India is a nation of thirty six crores of men,
women, and children. The welfare of India lies in the welfare of these thirty
six crores of people. Our time is nearly over. We have discharged our duty
to the best of our ability, and now it is the younger people who must
assume responsibility. So long as there was strength in us we carried the
torch of freedom without faltering and never letting it fall. Now, the millions
of young boys and girls in India have to carry on the task after us with
honour and pride, and serve the country, and work for her progress, and
above all, to find a way to wipe the tears of millions of people who are in
great need. The most important task before us is to ensure that the millions
of children in the country get the basic necessities of life, the opportunity for
education, and proper physical and mental development, so that they can
grow up and take on the burdens of this great country.
        This is a challenging task. It cannot be done by merely passing laws
or issuing edicts. The Government is certainly responsible for the people,
but it cannot discharge its responsibility until the people of the country
cooperate wholeheartedly and willingly. It is indeed a gigantic task, and this
cannot be accomplished by the Government alone without the participation
of all the people. There may be differences of opinion on political, social
and economic issues. But basically our tasks can be done only by the
mutual cooperation of all the people.
       There are a number of issues on which there is a difference of
opinion, and the barriers are insurmountable. What are the areas in which
the cooperation of all the people is essential? After all, we are all citizens of
this great country and, irrespective of our religion, caste, province, or
language, we owe a duty to our country. All of us are shareholders in
India's freedom and, therefore, equally responsible for maintaining and
protecting that freedom. There are certain paths which tend to lead us
astray, into violence and internecine quarrels in which voices are raised in
anger against one another. It is absurd to think that such paths can lead the
country to its goal of progress and development. Such thinking is born out
of ignorance and is the surest path ruin. We must be constantly vigilant
against such tendencies because, no matter how great the principle behind
the quarrel, the internal feud and disunity can only lead the country to ruin,
bloodshed and violence.
      Then there are others who fight in the name of religion. We have
learned the lesson of the evils of communalism in the past, and it is
absolutely certain that it cannot lead to progress but only to further
weakening of the country. We will fritter away our energies in futile
squabbles instead of concentrating on progress. We must guard ourselves
against such tendencies. Another category of people is the selfish black
marketeers who get rich at the expense of the poor and needy.
These are the factors against which we must guard ourselves. We are
citizens of a great nation with a glorious history behind it. The people of a
great nation ought to be large-hearted and perform great deeds. They
should not stoop to chicanery and wrong-doing. We achieved
independence in a grand manner and now we must continue to uphold that
tradition. We will hand over the torch of freedom, when our strength fails, to
the youth of the country. Once our duty is done, we can be thrown on the
scrap-heap. But, so long as there is strength in our minds and body, until
the very last moment, we must toil for the cause of the country, in the
service of India's millions and strive towards progress. Once our strength
fails, our time will be up and we need not be bothered about what happens
to us, for others will carry on.
      We must set about this big task from the larger angle of the whole
country, and not from the viewpoint of any single province, community,
caste or religion. Every individual is free to follow his own religion and
occupation. But ultimately the biggest duty, profession and religion of any
person today is to serve the thirty-six crores of people, to uplift the poor, the
downtrodden masses and to wipe out every tear from every eye of the
suffering people.
     We have had to suffer great hardships in the last few years. Natural
calamities like drought and earthquakes had afflicted the country. Anyhow,
we have nearly overcome our troubles.
     This year we have fared much better than we have done in the past.
There has been plenty of rainfall, and the position of food and other basic
necessities is better now than in previous years. Yet we must constantly
bear in mind that India is a vast country and some areas of distress are
likely to be present in the country at all times. The rainfall has been good
and food production has been above average. Yet in some districts like
Gorakhpur, Azamgarh, Deoria and Basti in Uttar Pradesh, some regions in
Bihar, and the Sundarbans area in West Bengal, Rayalaseema in the
South, some districts in Mysore, Rajasthan and Saurashtra, conditions of
great distress and privation prevail.
      It is our duty to help these people in every way. Not only should we
provide temporary relief but make arrangements to ensure that they can
stand on their own feet and participate in the general progress of the
country. Ultimately, the thirty-six crores of people of India belong to one
large family and we must march together in step and go forward to achieve
progress. Those who think that they can progress, while others lag behind,
are mistaken, because the latter will drag others down with them.
Therefore, it is imperative that the whole country must march together.
       There are three main dangers facing the country. One is caused by
disunity and internal dissensions, two, by the greed and avarice of black
marketeers and profiteers who make money through corruption, bribery,
etc., and the third by communalism. It is strange that, in spite of the bitter
lesson that we have learnt in the past, there are some people who indulge
in such activities, and even take pride in running down other religions and
maintain that they are helping their own religion by doing so.
       Recently, I was extremely annoyed to read about an incident in
Allahabad, which was wholly uncivilized. It angered me that any individual
in India could be so foolish. Yet there were some other foolish people who,
instead of acknowledging that it was wrong and punishing the wrongdoer,
retaliated by saving that they would not participate in the Independence
Day celebrations, as a protest. How can any Indian behave like this? It may
not be necessary that everyone should participate in the celebrations. But it
is foolish to express anger and resentment on an auspicious day, no matter
what the provocation may be. It is something which stains India's freedom
and sullies her honour.
       Ultimately, we all must bear in mind that we have to march together.
If we let ourselves drift away from our path because of the wrong action of
one, a hundred or a thousand individuals, the country will be ruined. Please
remember what India's ancient culture and tradition teach us. You must
bear in mind what a great Indian has said over two thousand years ago,
and not merely said but had his sayings engraved on big stones and
columns all over the country. The great emperor Asoka said that if the
followers of one religion respect and tolerate other religions, they, by doing
so, only enhance the respect of their own religion. Those who show
disrespect to the faith of others only degrade their own faith. This has been
the principle of India's culture for thousands of years, and not of bitterness,
hatred and feuds as some people in their ignorance today imagine.
      If you look at the world, you will find it in the grip of a psychosis.
There is a constant talk of war everywhere, and nobody knows when things
may get out of hand and the world razed to the ground. We are a weak
nation. Yet we have raised our voice for peace. We have done so in the
past, and we will continue to strive for peace in the world until our last
breath. But that is possible only when we all progress together as a nation.
      While there is this talk of war throughout the world, there is another
kind of war that is going on in South Africa. This has a relation in a way to
India, because the method being adopted there is the method of
satyagraha shown by a great soul of India. The war is for the principle of
equality of all human beings.
      Racialism is rampant in South Africa, with the whites brutally
suppressing the blacks. The people of South Africa have learnt the lesson
taught by Mahatma Gandhi, and are peacefully opposing racial oppression.
I am happy to know that the Indian residents of South Africa are
cooperating fully with the Africans in their struggle. I am convinced that the
sympathy of the people of this country will go out to the struggling people of
South Africa.
      It is through this peaceful method we won freedom, and I hope that in
future too we will continue to solve our problems by peaceful means. Let us
constantly bear this in mind, and renew our pledge once again on this day
to work for the progress of India, for it is imperative for our very survival.
We must continue to uphold the ancient tradition and culture of India and
make every effort to maintain peace in the world. We have on our hands
the urgent task of removing poverty and unemployment from the country.
We may not hope to complete the task in our life time, but we must do what
we can. After that, others will carry on.
       I want you on this day to examine what our weaknesses are, and look
inwards, instead of criticizing others. If everyone does his duty, the world
will be a far better place. We must learn the lesson of cooperation and
discipline from the members of our armed forces. They are meant to
protect the country, and they are imbued with a sense of discipline. Men
from all States and from all religions join the army, navy and air force and
work together in harmony and cooperation. They do not fight among
themselves. Our armed forces symbolize courage and unity. We must
emulate the same sense of discipline and teamwork. We must not fight
among ourselves but work with the firm intention of accomplishing the big
tasks which confront us, of becoming self-reliant instead of depending on
the Government for everything. Only then can India progress."
1951,Jawaharlal Nehru,INC,For a Concerted Effort to End Poverty,"Speech from the ramparts of the Red Fort, New Delhi, on Independence Day, 15 August From National Herald, 17 August 1951.","Selected works of Jawaharlal Nehru. Second Series. Vol 16: Part II, (1 July 1951 - 31 October 1951)",http://nehruportal.nic.in/selected-works-jawahar-lal-nehru-second-series-16-part-ii#page/460/mode/2up,"Four years are not a very long period in the life of a nation. Yet it is
true that the last four years seem to be an age so far as India is concerned.
Vital experiences the Indian people have passed through have apparently
lengthened the span of these years considerably.
      I sometimes wonder what would have happened had the people of
India not passed through the trials and tribulations which had fallen to their
lot during the past four years.
      Even today, when times are hard, many people are prone to be
careless. ease-loving and selfish, much to the detriment of the nation.
Naturally, I fear to imagine that if the times were not so difficult, perhaps the
whole nation might have fallen a prey to carelessness and selfishness.
Nothing can be more dangerous and deplorable than that a nation should
become careless and forget its ideals.
      What was that power which inspired us in our fight for freedom? That
power was the strength of our minds, of the hearts of millions of ordinary
men whom Mahatma Gandhi had taught not to be afraid even of the
mightiest imperialist power. If that strength of heart and mind was lacking,
then no other power could save the country.
       It is, therefore, proper that on this anniversary day of nation's
freedom, the people should look back and ponder over what had increased
their strength and had helped them in winning freedom. At the same time,
they should pledge to avoid all those pitfalls which had weakened India in
the past and made her the slave of others.
      Unfortunately, many people believe that after independence their
work has been completed. This attitude is utterly wrong because, for the
maintenance of independence, eternal vigilance is necessary and
whosoever is not vigilant is bound to go under in the harsh merciless world
of today.
      I am proud of the Indian Army, Navy and Air Force which are manned
by brave young men who can be depended upon to protect the country.
But, a country can ultimately be defended only by its people and not by
armies alone. The security of the country depends on whether the people
are brave or not, and whether they entangle themselves in minor conflicts
or care for big things.
      There is great need for hard work. A country whose people shirk work
is bound to be weakened. Along with hard work, united action is necessary.
People must remember that we are all sailing in the same boat. We have,
therefore, to sink or swim together. If the country goes ahead, all are bound
to be benefited. But if, unfortunately, it goes under, nobody will be able to
escape his doom.
       Some foolish people may try to disturb national unity either out of
sheer stupidity or because of their calculated move to weaken the country. I
have heard that some persons tried to create some trouble in the city of
Delhi this morning or last night. It is the bounden duty of the people to
frustrate each and every move of such foolish people.
       People are facing the problems of rising prices, black marketing and
other such difficulties. These problems are created by two factors, first,
those which are out of our control, like the Korean war, and secondly, those
which can be controlled by us. The black market is of the latter category
and any government should try to curb it with an iron hand. Perhaps, in the
past that vice had not been combated as effectively as it ought to have
been. But then it was not merely the responsibility of the Government to do
that. People also had to cooperate with the Government and both had to
find a way out of the mess.
       The success of the five-year plan depends upon the measure of
people's support. Many people have suggested that we should get foreign
aid in order to push through national projects. Foreign aid is welcome if no
strings are attached to it. But the people must realise that we cannot go on
looking towards outsiders for help.
      Moreover, silver and gold alone, howsoever important they are, do
not constitute by themselves the wealth of a nation. In fact, the real wealth
of a nation is the hard work of its people. Government help may be there,
but the work has to be done by the people. For instance, China is making
rapid progress because its people are working hard. Each village there is
competing in a friendly manner with every other village to construct and
produce more and more, and naturally great results are being produced.
The United States of America is another example worth following. This
country is the richest in the world because its people work hard to produce
wealth. In India also some people in villages have built roads and public
buildings without depending on Government machinery which is inevitably
slow.
      I appeal to you not to look down upon manual work and to keep up
the dignity of labour. It is not proper for everyone to seek office jobs. You
must produce with your own hands.
       A world war will completely destroy civilization as it exists today and
will take the world back to savagery. Korea ought to be a lesson to those
who talk glibly of war. That unfortunate country has been almost completely
devastated by a war between two great powers. People claim that they
have gone to Korea to liberate it. I am afraid that soon there might not be
left any Korean to need liberation.
      That is why India has consistently followed a policy for world peace
and particularly for peace with its neighbour, Pakistan. It has to be
understood that partition has been brought about by mutual agreement and
has to be accepted. Therefore, all talk of its annulment is wrong, and does
no good to anybody.
      War drums are being beaten in Pakistan and there is a cry for jehad.
India has naturally taken precautionary measures, for the defence of the
country is our primary responsibility. At the same time we have made it
clear that we want no war with anybody, much less with Pakistan.
      I am grateful to the people of India who have remained perfectly calm
despite sabre-rattling on the other side of the border. Even in our border
areas people are carrying on their normal vocations unruffled. This is a sign
of our strength and our peaceful intentions.
      I want to tell the people of Pakistan and the whole world that there is
no reason why the bonds which had tied the people of India and Pakistan
so long should now be broken. Why should the two countries waste their
strength in mutual conflict?
     I urge the people of India not to bear any ill will towards the people of
Pakistan. There are good people and bad people on both sides. If some
people in Pakistan do something wrong, it does not mean that we should
consider the whole nation as our enemy."
1950,Jawaharlal Nehru,INC,Unity and Equality,"Speech from the Red Fort, Delhi, on Independence Day, 15 August 1950, AIR tapes, N.M.M.L. Original in Hindi.","Selected works of Jawaharlal Nehru. Second Series. Vol 15, Part 1 (1 August - 25 October 1950)",http://nehruportal.nic.in/selected-works-jawahar-lal-nehru-second-series-15-part-i#page/34/mode/2up,"Sisters and brothers, this is the third anniversary of the independence
of India. I congratulate you on this auspicious occasion. We have come a
long way during these three years. We have stumbled and fallen but have
picked ourselves up and gone on. I congratulate you for everything that has
happened, good and bad, during these years. Why do I include the bad?
Perhaps that is wrong. But what I mean is that you are to be congratulated
for the joys as well as the sorrows that these three years have brought.
Nations grow with the joys as well as the sorrows and troubles that come
their way. When long years go by without a nation being tested it becomes
slack and weak. We have been through gruelling tests during the last three
years, and also in the years which preceded independence. We gained
independence by passing those tests with flying colours. Now the nation
faces even greater challenges and we shall succeed to the extent that we
succeed in facing them with courage and confidence. You should accept
the good and the bad, happiness and sorrow, as they come. What you
must guard against, however, is cowardice, narrow-mindedness and
disunity because they weaken the nation and pave the way for its downfall
by debilitating its strength to protect its freedom.
        We have been able to reach many of our goals in the last three years.
On the 26th of January this year, we saw a big dream of ours come true.
There are many other dreams which still remain unfulfilled. Within a few
months, millions of people will be going to the polls to elect a new
government and the new Constitution which we have adopted will bear
fruit. In this way, we are inching forward step by step, no doubt with
difficulty, bearing many hardships. But we are going ahead anyway.
       Look at the world around you and the troubles that other countries
are facing. There is once again talk of war. Then you come to India where,
in spite of our weaknesses and evils, we are gradually making progress. It
is against the backdrop of the world situation that we must try to
understand India, bearing in mind where our duty lies at a time when the
whole world is in turmoil. We cannot look to others to help us out of our
difficulties, for if we did, we would become weak. We fought for our
freedom by relying not on others or on any weapons but on ourselves and
our courage and so we succeeded. Similarly, we can overcome the
dangers that threaten us only by relying on ourselves. We do not want
enmity with anyone. We want to be friends with all nations. But ultimately
we have to rely on our own strength.
       Freedom of thought and of expression is an essential prerequisite of
a free country. People should be free to form different parties and express
their political views. Without this freedom a country cannot remain free. But,
at the same time you should beware of people who work against our
freedom or do something by which that freedom is shaken or weakened.
Freedom of thought and expression must prevail but always with the
proviso that it does not weaken the country's unity or independence. If that
happens, it is a betrayal of the country. People often fail to make this
distinction. Freedom does not give the right to anyone to do evil. Freedom
of expression does not mean the freedom to abuse others in the street or
print obscenities in newspapers. Such things will vitiate our entire life.
Freedom particularly does not mean a right to strike at the roots of that
freedom. If someone attempts such a thing, it is obvious that we have to
prevent it. There are many people in the country today who have fomented
trouble and incited people in the name of freedom and tried to weaken the
nation. They have been dealt with, and since India is strong in spite of our
weaknesses, we have succeeded and continue to progress. Some people
have made a declaration that they would not participate in the
Independence Day celebrations. Some others went a step further and said
they would obstruct the proceedings. You can imagine the kind of mentality
which prompts such thinking and emotions. This has nothing to do with
freedom of expression or thought. It is an outright onslaught on India's
freedom and, no matter who they are or to which party they belong, we
have to fight against them and root them out completely.
      What is the meaning of all this? There are people in the country who
are always fomenting disunity and trouble in the land. Their constant cry
seems to be that the freedom they have is not enough; and so they want to
break up even what they have. This is indeed strange, and indicates
stupidity or some strange quirk of emotion. How can anyone behave in this
manner when we are living at a crucial time in the history of India and of the
world? If we Indians have differences of opinion, we may quarrel among
ourselves, but when the question of India arises, it is the duty of all Indians
to bury their mutual differences and to remember that our loyalty is to the
country. Those who do not accept this are not Indians. They are welcome
to go and live elsewhere.
       What brought us together in the past was the unity of India despite
various diversities of religion, caste, province and region. Now I find that
some parties are once again raising their voices in favour of communalism
and fostering fissiparous tendencies in the country. They invoke the name
of religion for purely political purposes. You can imagine whether
communalism and provincialism will weaken the country or strengthen it.
People are welcome to hold different views and to give free expression to
them. I do not want everyone in India to repeat the same thing like parrots
as though they had no power to think for themselves. We have every right
to express our views. But no Indian has the right to raise his voice against
India's freedom or to do something which weakens her unity. Those who
indulge in such things, whether they understand it or not, are traitors. We
must understand these fundamental truths for we are living at a delicate
moment in history and we cannot progress unless our freedom is secure.
       As you know, there are many problems before us. The world is in a
strange flux today. War is going on in a part of Asia, and though Korea is a
small country, it is a terrible war. Nobody knows how long it will last,
whether it will remain limited there or engulf the world. We are making all
efforts to end it soon, but our efforts cannot succeed all over the world.
Nobody knows what might happen. But we can do one thing at least: if we
can set our own house in order and keep the country on an even keel, give
her a proper direction, we can keep India safe even if there is a world
conflagration. We can even help to save the world if we have the strength
and the spirit and if we are united.
      Many problems are before us today, the biggest being that of food.
Everyone needs to eat. We have made tremendous efforts during the last
two to three years to solve this problem. As you know, there is food
shortage even now in Madras, Bihar and some other States. The reports
that come in are heart-rending. The situation is still pretty serious. But it has
been blown out of all proportion and that is even more serious.
       So our first priority is to solve the food problem. Due to various
reasons enough food is not produced in India. Many factors are responsible
for that: the war, partition with the creation of Pakistan, large
food-producing areas have been lost to us and our population has
increased. A country, particularly a large country like ours which does not
produce enough food, becomes dependent on others. We have to spend
enormous amounts of foreign exchange on importing food. But the most
important thing is that it weakens us and leaves us vulnerable to outside
pressures which may threaten our freedom.
       If, unfortunately, there is a world war, we would not be able to import
foodgrains at all. How will we manage then? It is obvious that we have to
become self-sufficient in food. Secondly, we must change our food habits.
If a certain type of food is available, we should be ready to eat it. We must
learn to eat whatever is available, particularly if import of foodgrains
becomes impossible. We must try to produce enough foodgrains in the
country. We must not waste even the smallest quantity of food. We have
been thinking of ways and means of doing so. I want you to understand
that we will stick to what we said about stopping all import of foodgrains
and becoming self-sufficient in two years. Even if there are some
shortages, we shall have to put up with that. This is our policy and
programme and we will stick to it despite difficulties.
      You will find that the situation on the food front is rather strange. On
the one hand, there is no doubt that we are succeeding in our drive to
produce more food and we shall grow more in the next year or two. But at
the same time, we have had natural calamities like floods and drought in
certain areas such as Madras. Bihar and Saurashtra. We do not have
enough food stocks in the country to tide us over these crises. Even so we
have sent supplies to the worst affected areas. There may be problems in
supplying foodgrains to all the villages. But there is sufficient food in every
State for the next two or three months. So there is no cause for alarm. It is
true that any problem of this kind is a sign of inefficiency in our
administration either in the States or at the Centre. I accept that. We must
not try to evade our responsibility but learn a lesson.
       The other thing, which is more serious, is that there are many people
in India who have no scruples in making profits out of other people's
distress. Traders and shopkeepers hoard foodgrains in order to make a
profit later. I cannot understand this mentality which prompts people to
cash in on adversity. How can we tolerate that? You will say that all this is
mere talk and that Jawaharlal had said three years ago that black
marketeers would be severely punished, but that nothing has been done.
You would be justified in saying this. I am myself ashamed that we should
have become so callous as to allow black marketeers to flourish. It
happens openly in Delhi and we seem helpless to do anything about it.
Why should anyone tolerate some people taking advantage of a shortage
to make money, and becoming millionaires, without caring whether some
other people are dying? It is obvious that the first duty of the Government is
to deal with this. But no matter how many laws a government may pass,
they cannot be effective unless the people help and cooperate with the
government. If all of us make up our minds to put an end to black marketing
and hoarding we can do it; and those who persist in these activities will be
severely punished.
      You may have read in the newspapers that a Bill was moved in
Parliament a few days ago and only last evening a law has been passed to
put an end to these activities. The law will be implemented within a few
days and we shall take action to curb inflation. The Central Government
has assumed some powers to deal with the matter even at the State level
in order to ensure uniform action throughout the country. But, as I said, we
need your help because it cannot be implemented without the help and
cooperation of the people. Your complaint that the officials do not discharge
their duties well and sometimes take bribes may be justified. We must
correct such mistakes and remove the guilty officials.
        There is another problem before us which concerns the whole of
India and particularly the city of Delhi. This is the refugee problem. We
have made an effort to gradually solve this problem. But it is regrettable
that innumerable people are still in camps, braving the vagaries of weather
- first the heat of the summer and now the rains. Time is passing, but the
problem remains unsolved. I would, however, like to point out that it is not
possible for the Government to solve this problem on their own. We need
the help of the people, particularly the refugees. It is almost impossible for
the Government to solve every problem. We have succeeded to some
extent here. But the problem has assumed terrible proportions in Bengal.
As you know, we reached an Agreement with Pakistan four months ago
which has generated much discussion. Some people seem to think that we
have made a mistake. But that is irrelevant, if we are determined to solve
the problem, we can succeed. I do not want to go into the details just now,
but I want to tell you honestly and sincerely that though the problem of the
Bengali refugees is extremely complicated and troublesome, in my view, it
is being gradually solved. I cannot make any promises about what happens
in the future. That depends on the strength or weakness of the people. But
I am not prepared to accept, even for a minute, that the situation is
hopeless or that any steps should be taken which, instead of improving the
situation, will only bring ruin and hardship to Bengal and the rest of India.
      Behind all such problems as food shortage and the rehabilitation of
refugees lies the real problem of the economic development of India. How
are we to bring that about? It can be done only through cooperation
between the Government and the people. Neither the Government nor the
people can do it on their own. You have every right to point out the
weaknesses and shortcomings of the Government, to criticize them, and
also to change the Government any time that you choose. But in criticizing
the Government or objecting to their policies, you must not do anything
which weakens India. You must be careful because very often people
forget this. Governments and people come and go. Our time will also
gradually come to an end. As I told you, we are soon going to have general
elections. In any case, we will not be in power for ever. But so long as we
have the responsibility of administering the country, we cannot show any
weakness. We must work hard and to the best of our ability, mental and
physical, so long as we are in charge, whether the danger is external or
internal.
         I would like to repeat on this anniversary of India's independence that
though India is free, freedom brings in its wake its own responsibilities, not
only for the Government but for every single individual who enjoys that
freedom. If you do not understand and accept those responsibilities, it
shows that you have not understood the true meaning of freedom and if
ever that freedom is threatened, you will not be able to defend and protect
it. If there is an external attack upon India, our armed services, the army,
the navy and the air force, in which some of our best young men work, will
no doubt fight and repel it. But, ultimately, it is not the armed forces which
save a country; it is the men and women in the country who do so and
unless every single individual in India considers himself or herself as India's
soldier, the country cannot remain safe. When we were fighting for
freedom, we did not wear any uniform and yet we regarded ourselves as
soldiers in the cause of freedom and faced the British empire fearlessly.
People in other countries were amazed at what we dared to do -- a motley
rabble of weak and unarmed human beings challenging the might of a
great imperial power! But the strange thing is that at that time, there was no
fear in our hearts. We had learnt the lesson of fearlessness from that great
leader of ours, and so we went ahead boldly as soldiers of India's freedom.
We must create that atmosphere once again and learn to be completely
fearless.
     We must remember these fundamentals on the anniversary of India's
independence and avoid petty quarrels. The unity of India is of fundamental
importance. India can become strong and can progress only when there is
complete equality for everyone, irrespective of religion, caste and province.
All doors of opportunity are open to everyone, and all the citizens of the
country are equal shareholders in freedom. If there is disunity and people
fight with each other, believe me, we shall weaken ourselves and the
country's freedom. The only course open to us is to forge ahead and face
the problems which confront us, whether it is of food shortage or something
else, squarely and without fear or panic in our hearts. A man who is afraid
is useless and unfit for anything. When the problems are bigger, we have to
face them with greater fortitude instead of giving in to panic or running
away in fear.
      So I greet you once again on the third anniversary of our
independence. I hope that in the coming year we shall face our problems
with courage and determination, rather welcome them, and solve and
overcome them. Jai Hind."
1949,Jawaharlal Nehru,INC,Two Years of Independence,"Translated from speech in Hindi delivered at the Red Fort Delhi, August 15, 1949","Jawaharlal Nehru's Speeches, Volume 2",NA,"Since I first unfurled the National Flag on the Red Fort, two years
have been added to India's long history which began thousands of years
ago. During these two years, we have seen achievements and failures, we
have experienced joy and sorrow. The good work we have done will remain
even though we pass away. So will India, though generations come and go.
      Great questions face us and our task will not be over till we have
answered them. Our objective is to make it possible for the millions of India
to lead contented and purposeful lives. We cannot do that till we have
solved, to a large extent, the problems that face us.
      On a day like this we should try to detach ourselves from the
problems of the moment and see from a distance, as it were, what is
happening in our country and in the world. It is right that we forget our little
troubles for a while and think of the major currents that are flowing in our
country.
       Thirty years ago there appeared on the Indian scene a mighty man of
destiny who lighted our path. That light illumined our minds and hearts and
large numbers of our people, forgetting their own troubles and domestic
difficulties, their property and family, responded to his call. It was not for
personal gain of any kind. Among these there existed a friendly competition
as to who could serve the motherland better and more effectively. Our
consuming obsession was the liberation of our country.
       The star of a free India beckoned us forward. We dreamed of
freedom from poverty and distress. We gained our political freedom at last
but the other freedom still remains for us to achieve. Before we could do
much to achieve it new problems came in our way. Sixty lakhs of people
migrated to India as refugees. We faced this problem as we had faced
others. I suppose we made some mistakes but no one reviewing these two
years will fail to appreciate our forward march in the face of all kinds of
difficulties.
      Unarmed and peaceful, we faced a proud empire, not looking for aid
to any other country and relying only on ourselves. We had faith in our
leader, our country and in ourselves. This gave us the strength that
sustained us during our struggle for independence. If we had faith and
self-confidence when to outward seeming we were powerless, then surely
we are much better off today when we are a free people with the strength
of a great country behind us. Why then should our faith and our confidence
in ourselves weaken? It is true that we have tremendous economic and
other difficulties to face; it is also true that while we have rehabilitated lakhs
of refugees, large numbers still remain to be helped and rehabilitated. But
we have faced even bigger problems in the past. Why should we not face
these in the same way also? We must not let our minds get entangled in
petty questions and difficulties and forget the main issues.
      We belong to a great country, a country that is not only great
physically but in things far more important. If we are to be worthy of our
country, we must have big minds and big hearts, for small men cannot face
big issues or accomplish big tasks. Let each one of us do his duty to his
country and to his people and not dwell too much on the duty of others.
Some people get into the habit of criticizing others without doing anything
themselves. Nothing good can come out of that type of criticism. So,
wherever you may be, whether you are in the Army or the Air Force or the
Navy or in the civil employ of the Government, each one of you must do
your duty efficiently and in a spirit of service to the nation. If the vast
number of our countrymen apply themselves to their tasks in their
innumerable capacities and co-operate with others, forgetting the petty
things that divide them, we shall marvel at the speed with which India will
progress.
      I want you to think for a moment of the days when we fought the
battle of India's freedom without arms and without much by way of
resources. We had a great leader who inspired us. We had other leaders,
too, but it was the masses of this country who bore the brunt of the
struggle. They had faith in their country and their leaders and they relied
upon themselves. Today, we have more strength than we ever had. It is,
therefore, surprising that some people should feel dejected, have no
confidence in themselves and complain all the time.
      Let us get back the purposefulness, the enthusiasm, the
self-confidence and the faith which moved us at the time of our struggle for
freedom. Let us put aside our petty quarrels and factions and think only of
the great objective before us.
      In our foreign policy, we have proclaimed that we shall join no power
bloc and endeavour to co-operate and be friendly with all countries. Our
position in the world ultimately depends on the unity and strength of the
country, on how far we proceed in the solution of our economic and other
problems and on how much we can raise the depressed masses of India.
We may not be able to complete that task, for it is colossal. Even so, if we
make some headway it will be easier for others to complete the task.
        A nation's work never ends. Men may come and go, generations may
pass but the life of a nation goes on. We must remember the basic fact that
we can achieve little unless there is peace in the country, no matter what
policy we pursue. There are some misguided people who indulge in
violence and try to create disorder. I wonder how anybody with the least
intelligence can think in terms of such anti-national activities. Bomb
throwing, for instance, can do the country no good. On the contrary, it
further aggravates our economic situation, which is a source of great
anxiety to us. Therefore, it is the duty of everyone, no matter what his
politics, to help in the maintenance of peace in the country.
       The people have every right to change laws and even to change
governments and they can exercise that right in a peaceful and democratic
manner. But those who choose the path of violence have no faith in
democracy. If their way were to prevail, there would be complete chaos in
the country and the condition of the people would deteriorate even more.
All progress would cease and the next few generations would have to carry
a heavy burden.
      I am still more distressed by those who, while condemning violence,
join hands with those who indulge in violence. They think only in terms of
winning an election and forget that the cause of the country and of the
people is bigger than any party. If we forget India and her people while
pursuing our smaller objectives, then we are indeed guilty of betraying our
country. I wish to emphasize that all of us must understand that our most
important objective is the safety and security of India and the prosperity
and advancement of her people. That can only be achieved effectively if we
stop quarrelling amongst ourselves and try to solve the great problems that
confront us by democratic and peaceful methods.
     We must look at our problems in a proper perspective. If we are
preoccupied with petty problems, we shall fail to solve the larger and more
important ones.
      We must learn to depend on ourselves and not look to others for help
every time we are in trouble. Certainly we want to make friends with the
rest of the world. We also seek the goodwill and co-operation of all those
who reside in this country, whatever their race or nationality. We welcome
help and co-operation from every quarter but we must depend primarily on
our own resources. We should not forget that those who lean too much on
others tend to become weak and helpless themselves. A country's freedom
can be preserved only by her own strength and self-reliance.
       We are not hostile to any country and we do not want to meddle in
other people's affairs. Every nation should be free to choose the path it
considers best. We do not wish to interfere with the freedom of other
nations and we expect them to feel the same about our freedom. That is
why we have decided not to join any of the power blocs in the world. We
will remain aloof and try to be friendly to all. We intend to progress
according to our own ideas. We have decided to follow this policy, not only
because it is essentially a sound one from our country's point of view but
also because it seems to be the only way to serve the cause of world
peace. Another world war will spell ruin and we shall not escape the
general disaster. We are determined to make every possible effort in the
cause of peace. That explains our present foreign policy.
      Perhaps you know that I am shortly going to visit a country which is
great and powerful. I propose to carry with me a message of friendship and
assurances of co-operation from our people. Keeping our own freedom
intact, we wish to befriend other nations. Our friendship with one country
should not be interpreted as hostility to another.
       Asia is passing through a great revolutionary phase and naturally
India has also been affected. In other parts of Asia there is struggle and
ferment. This morning's newspaper contained the news of trouble and
upheaval in a small but important country of Western Asia. We do not know
all the facts and in any event I do not wish to express an opinion. All I want
to say is that the prevalence of violence and violent methods weaken a
country and undermine her progress.
       In Eastern Asia, a great and ancient country is experiencing
revolutionary changes of tremendous significance. Whatever our individual
reactions to these may be, our policy, namely, that we do not wish to
interfere in any way with the internal affairs of other countries, is clear.
Each country should have the freedom to go the way it chooses. It is for its
people to decide their future. Any attempt at outside interference or
compulsion must necessarily lead to evil results. No country can impose
freedom on any other. That is a contradiction in terms. The world has a
great deal of variety and it should be no one's business to suppress this
variety or to impose ways of thinking and acting on others. We should,
therefore, survey world events in a spirit of understanding and friendship to
all.
      Our Constituent Assembly is busy framing a new constitution for India
and soon we shall adopt a republican form of government. However, laws
and constitutions do not by themselves make a country great. It is the
enthusiasm, energy and constant effort of a people that make it a great
nation. Men of Law lay down constitutions but history is really made by
great minds, large hearts and stout arms; by the sweat, tears and toil of a
people.
      Let us, therefore, learn to study our country's problems in the larger
perspective of the world and let us not permit the minor questions of the
day to overwhelm us. I have faith in India and her great destiny. A country
must have military strength but armed power does not by itself constitute a
country's real strength. Her real strength lies in the capacity of her people
for disciplined work. Only hard work can produce wealth for us and rid us of
our poverty. Each one of us, man or woman, young or old, must, therefore
toil and work. Rest is not for us. We did not win our freedom so that we
might rest afterwards but in order to work harder to hold and strengthen
that freedom. There is a great difference between the voluntary labour of a
free man for an objective of his choice and the drudgery of a slave. Our
labours as free men and women will lay the foundations for a great future
and our labour of love for the cause of India and her people will endure; so
will the fact that we are building, brick by brick, the great mansion of free
India. There is joy in such work and even when we have departed that work
will be there for future generations to see.
      One of our most important problems today is that of growing more
food. We must avoid wasting food at all costs. We must conserve our
present resources with great care. We have to tighten our belts. If the
co-operation of the people is forthcoming, we shall solve not only this
problem but many others. Our petty squabbles and party differences can
wait. What is vital and important for us is to keep before us the picture of a
great India. India is enduring and will continue to be there long after we are
gone."
1948,Jawaharlal Nehru,INC,The Task Ahead,"Broadcast from New Delhi, August 15, 1948","Jawaharlal Nehru's Speeches, Volume 1",NA,"Fellow countrymen, comrades and friends! A year ago on this very
day and at this very hour I broadcast to you from this place. Free India is
one year old today. But what trials and tribulations she has passed through
during this infancy of her freedom! She has survived, in spite of all the peril
and disaster that might well have overwhelmed a more mature and well
established nation. We have reason to be thankful for this achievement and
for the many other achievements that stand to the credit of our people. Let
us not belittle our record or forget the courage, the sacrifice with which our
people have faced and overcome many of these perils during this fateful
year.
       But let us also not forget where we have failed or have erred. For, our
failures and errors have been many. Some of these are obvious enough,
but the real failure has been a failure of the spirit and a falling away from
the standards set by the Father of our Nation, under whose wise guidance
we had struggled and marched for over a quarter of a century. He taught us
that worthy ends could only be achieved through worthy means, that ideals
and objectives could never be divorced from the methods adopted to
realize them. He had told us to cast our fear, for fear is not only ignoble but
is also the parent of hatred and violence.
       Many of us forgot this lesson and fear gripped us, fear not of some
distant adversary, but fear of one another, and evil deeds followed in its
train.
       The Master who guided us and inspired us is no more. We have to
shoulder the burden ourselves now and the first question that we have to
put ourselves is this: Do we stand by his teaching and message or do we
stray into new paths? I want to tell you that this year of hard trial has
convinced me more than ever that if India is to prosper and grow in stature,
as she must and will, it will be through adherence to that message and
teaching. I know I am feeble and have often proved unworthy of India to
whose service I had pledged myself so often. But however unworthy we
may be of India, we have still something of the strength that the Master
gave us. That strength comes not only from him, but from his message,
and so today I pledge myself anew to the service of the Motherland and of
the ideals that Gandhiji placed before us.
      All of us talk of India and all of us demand many things from India.
What do we give her in return? We can take nothing from her beyond what
we give her. India will ultimately give us what we give her of love and
service and productive and creative work. India will be what we are: our
thoughts and actions will shape her. Born of her fruitful womb, we are
children of hers, little bits of the India of today, and yet we are also the
parents of the India of tomorrow. If we are big, so will India be, and if we
grow little-minded and narrow in outlook, so also will India be.
       Our troubles during the past year were largely the result of this
narrowness in outlook and pettiness in action which is so foreign to India's
great cultural inheritance. Communalism threatened to crush the free spirit
in us, the communalism of the Muslim, of the Hindu and of the Sikh.
Provincialism came in the way of that larger unity which is so essential to
India's greatness and progress. The spirit of faction spread and made us
forget the big things that we had stood for.
      We have to find ourselves again and go back to the free India of our
dreams. We have to rediscover the old values and place them in the new
setting of a free India. For freedom brings responsibility and can only be
sustained by self-discipline, hard work, and the spirit of a free people.
      So let us be rid of everything that limits us and degrades us. Let us
cast out fear and communalism and provincialism. Let us build up a free
and democratic India, where the interest of the masses of our people has
always the first place to which all other interests must submit.
       Freedom has no meaning unless it brings relief to these masses from
their many burdens. Democracy means tolerance, tolerance not merely of
those who agree with us, but of those who do not agree with us. With the
coming of freedom our patterns of behaviour must change also so as to fit
in with this freedom.
     There is conflict and there are rumours of greater conflict in India and
all over the world. We have to be ready for every emergency and
contingency. When the nation is in peril, the first duty of every citizen is to
give his or her service to the nation without fear or expectation of reward.
But today I do not wish to speak of conflicts and wars but rather of peace
and co-operation and I want to say to all the nations of the world, including
our neighbour country, that we stand for peace and friendship with them.
The only war that we want to fight with all our might is the war against
poverty and all its unhappy brood.
       All the world suffers from the after-effects of the World War, and
inflation and rising prices and unemployment oppress the people. In India
we have all these, and, in addition, the care of vast numbers of our brothers
and sisters who have suffered untold hardship and have been driven away
from their homes to seek a new life elsewhere.
       It is this war we have to fight, the war against economic crisis and to
rehabilitate the disinherited. In this war there is no hatred or violence but
only service of our country and our people. In this war every Indian can be
a soldier. This is no time for individuals or groups to think of a narrow
self-interest forgetting the larger good. This is not time for wrangling or the
spirit of action.
      And so I appeal to my countrymen and all countrywomen who have
the love of India in their hearts and the passion to raise her masses to cast
aside the barriers that separate them and to join together in this historic
and magnificent task worthy of a great people.
       To all those in our Services, civil and military, I would appeal for a
single-minded devotion to the cause of India and for integrity, hard work,
efficiency and impartiality. He who fails in this at this critical hour fails in his
duty to India and her people.
      To the youth of the country I would make a special appeal for they
are the leaders of tomorrow and on them will be cast the burden of
upholding India's honour and freedom.
      My generation is a passing one and soon we shall hand over the
bright torch of India, which embodies her great and eternal spirit, to
younger hands and stronger arms. May they hold it aloft, undimmed and
untarnished, so that its light reaches every home and brings faith and
courage and well being to our masses. JAI HIND."
1947,Jawaharlal Nehru,INC,First Servant of the Indian People,"Broadcast from New Delhi, August 15, 1947","Jawaharlal Nehru's Speeches, Volume 1",NA,"Fellow countrymen, it has been my privilege to serve India and the
cause of India's freedom for many years. Today I address you for the first
time officially as the First Servant of the Indian people, pledged to their
service and their betterment. I am here because you willed it so and I
remain here so long as you choose to honour me with your confidence.
      We are a free and sovereign people today and we have rid ourselves
of the burden of the past. We look at the world with clear and friendly eyes
and at the future with faith and confidence.
      The burden of foreign domination is done away with, but freedom
brings its own responsibilities and burdens, and they can only be
shouldered in the spirit of a free people, self-disciplined and determined to
preserve and enlarge that freedom.
         We have achieved much; we have to achieve much more. Let us then
address ourselves to our new tasks with the determination and adherence
to high principles which our great leader has taught us. Gandhiji is
fortunately with us to guide and inspire and ever to point to us the path of
high endeavour. He taught us long ago that ideals and objectives can never
be divorced from the methods adopted to realize them; that worthy ends
can only be achieved through worthy means. If we aim at the big things of
life, if we dream of India as a great nation giving her age-old message of
peace and freedom to others, then we have to be big ourselves and be
worthy children of Mother India. The eyes of the world are upon us
watching this birth of freedom in the East and wondering what it means.
       Our first and immediate objective must be to put an end to all internal
strife and violence, which disfigure and degrade us and injure the cause of
freedom. They come in the way of consideration of the great economic
problems of the masses of the people which so urgently demand attention.
       Our long subjection and the World War and its aftermath have made
us inherit an accumulation of vital problems, and today our people lack food
and clothing and and other necessaries, and we are caught in a spiral of
inflation and rising prices. We cannot solve these problems suddenly, but
we cannot also delay their solution. So we must plan wisely so that the
burdens on the masses may grow less and the standards of living go up.
We wish ill to none, but it must be clearly understood that the interests of
our long-suffering masses must come first and every entrenched interest
that comes in their way must yield to them. We have to change rapidly our
antiquated land tenure system, and we have also to promote
industrialization on a large and balanced scale, so as to add to the wealth
of the country, and thus to the national dividend which can be equitably
distributed.
      Production today is the first priority, and every attempt to hamper or
lessen production is injuring the nation, and more especially harmful to our
labouring masses. But production by itself is not enough, for this may lead
to an even greater concentration of wealth in a few hands, which comes in
the way of progress and which, in the context of today, produces instability
and conflict. Therefore, fair and equitable distribution is essential for any
solution of the problem.
      The Government of India have in hand at present several vast
schemes for developing river valleys by controlling the flow of rivers,
building dams and reservoirs and irrigation works and developing
hydro-electric power. These will lead to all-round development. These
schemes are thus basic to all planning and we intend to complete them as
rapidly as possible so that the masses may profit.
      All this requires peaceful conditions and the co-operation of all
concerned, and hard and continuous work. Let us then address ourselves
to these great and worthy tasks and forget our mutual wrangling and
conflicts. There is a time for quarrelling and there is a time for co-operative
endeavour. There is a time for work and there is a time for play: Today,
there is no time for quarrelling or overmuch play, unless we prove false to
our country and our people. Today, we must co-operate with one another
and work together, and
work with right goodwill.
     I should like to address a few words to our services, civil and military.
The old distinction and differences are gone and today we are all free sons
and daughters of India, proud of our country's freedom and joining together
in our service of her. Our common allegiance is to India. In the difficult days
ahead our Services and our experts have a vital role to play and we invite
them to do so as comrades in the service of India. JAI HIND."
